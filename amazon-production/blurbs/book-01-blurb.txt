She didn't ask to be chosen. The blade didn't ask for permission.

When the Dominion raids her temple and steals a sacred relic, warrior Itzil is thrust into a war she never expected — armed with a blade of pure sunlight that hasn't manifested in three hundred years and a prophecy she doesn't believe in.

The Dominion is hunting seven ancient relics that can open a gate sealed for centuries. On the other side: something vast, hungry, and patient.

With a bitter scout, a flashy duelist, a quiet engineer, and a healer with impossible abilities, Itzil must launch a desperate mission behind enemy lines — and discover just how far the Dominion is willing to go to open a door that should never be opened.

The sun is rising. The blade is lit. And the war has only just begun.
