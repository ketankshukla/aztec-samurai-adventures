The portals open. The army teleports. And the only person who can stop it is a wounded scout with eleven ghosts on his back.

When the Dominion's Beast Commander marches twelve thousand soldiers toward three allied cities — armed with mirror-portals that allow instant troop movement across a continent — Kaelen goes behind enemy lines alone to find the source and destroy it.

What he discovers is worse than a weapon. It's a prison. A human soul, crystallized and trapped, powering a network of doorways built by a man who calls suffering "innovation."

With the help of Miyako, a grey-haired exile from the Sun-Blade's lost shadow school, Kaelen must infiltrate the glass house and shatter the anchor before Gravok's army overwhelms three cities simultaneously.

The mirrors are broken. The horizon widens. And the door is cracking.
