The war moves from battlefields to ballrooms — and the most dangerous weapon is a lie that sounds like the truth.

When five neutral nations gather for a summit that will determine the fate of the continent, the alliance sends its best weapon: Zariel, a diplomat whose golden tongue has never met an argument it couldn't win. His opponent is Pearlvaine, the Dominion's demon-bonded negotiator, who can make any truth sound like whatever you want to hear.

The summit is a chess match. Pearlvaine offers peace. Zariel offers war. And the neutral nations are leaning toward the woman who promises safety — because safety is the easiest thing in the world to sell.

Meanwhile, the true nature of ash-oaths is decoded: they don't just enslave — they feed the Great Gate, converting human consciousness into fuel for a door that should never open.

The gates of Ashfall are open. The trap is set. And the alliance walks in knowing.
