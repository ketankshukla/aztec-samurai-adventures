The trap closes. The sky goes dark. And the alliance learns what war really costs.

Fortress Ashfall was supposed to be Volzentar's masterpiece — thirty thousand hidden soldiers, blood-wards on every exit, cascading sorcery designed to destroy the alliance in a single engagement. The alliance walked in knowing it was a trap. They turned it inside out.

The cost of that victory was a third of their army and the discovery that glory dies the moment you hold a dying boy in your arms.

A hawk rider dives through a magical storm to rescue wounded soldiers. Two neutral nations fall — fifty thousand people ash-oathed in a single day. And a ring of void appears in the sky: the Starless Crown, visible evidence that the dimensional barrier is thinning.

The Crown grows. The clock ticks. And the alliance — battered, diminished, changed — prepares for what comes next.
