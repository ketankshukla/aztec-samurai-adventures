The rescue was his plan. The relic was his weapon. And the enemy you can't see is the enemy you can't beat.

Kaelen designs the most elaborate operation the alliance has attempted — a counter-trap within a trap, layered with deceptions and false intelligence. The mission: rescue the water-knot mystic Rainara from a relic collector's mountain fortress. The result: a success so clean it can only mean the enemy wanted it to happen.

Valdremor — the Architect — has arrived. The intellectual power behind the Dominion. The man with the crystal eye who designed the ash-oath system, the Gate's activation sequence, and the mechanism that will end the world.

The cleverness that saved the alliance in Act I meets an opponent who is smarter, more patient, and more terrifying than anything they've faced. Valdremor doesn't fight wars. He engineers them.

The serpent coiled. The gambit played. And somewhere in the silence, the storm gathers.
