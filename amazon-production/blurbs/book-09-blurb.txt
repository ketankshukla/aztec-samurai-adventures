Nine heroes. Nine memories. One blade. The quiet man no one watched is about to save the world.

The Sun-Blade is shattered. But the armorer has been studying the fragments — and the fragments have been talking back. They're not dead. They're dormant. Waiting to be reforged into something greater. The price? Each hero must give a piece of their soul.

A parallel rescue mission infiltrates the Dominion's most secure prison through its unwarded river. A scholar reveals the bombs she planted in the villain's stolen knowledge. An entity the size of a continent speaks to the world: "I SEE YOU. ALL OF YOU. AND I AM HUNGRY."

A blade reforged from nine colors blazes against a bleeding sky. The blade that emerges is not one person's weapon. It's everyone's.

The final charge begins.

"I just listened to the metal."
