The healer walks into a dimension made of shattered glass. Every mirror is a weapon. Every reflection hides an assassin. And the only way to free thousands of trapped souls is to survive long enough to reach them.

Neyla's ash-oath reversal technique is draining the Great Gate's power — one freed soul at a time. Valdremor's response? Send Mirathane, an assassin who kills through reflections. Any mirror. Any water. Any polished surface. She never fails.

Thousands of trapped souls are freed in a cascade that shakes the Gate and makes a continent-sized entity scream. A healer looks at the assassin who tried to kill her and says: "I can see what they did to you."

A new sight reveals the truth: Vastrix isn't a creature — it's a dimension. Bigger than the world. And the siege of the Dominion capital begins.

"I see you. I'm here. You're going home."
