The war is over. The world is saved. Now comes the harder part: figuring out what to do with the world you saved.

The Gate is rubble. The Crown is golden snow. The sky is clear for the first time in years. And nine heroes who gave everything to save the world must now learn to live in it.

A healer frees the last slaves and hears a mother say: "I remember my daughter's name." A duelist walks the battlefield counting the dead — because someone should. An engineer draws blueprints by candlelight — not for weapons, but for homes. A commander refuses a crown: "I didn't fight a tyrant to become one."

Names are carved in obsidian — heroes and villains together. "In death, there are no sides." And somewhere at the edge of the world, a child finds a shard that pulses with light older than anything the series has seen.

"Show up. Give willingly. Choose each other."
