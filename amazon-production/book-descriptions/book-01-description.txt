She didn't ask to be chosen. The blade didn't ask for permission.

When the Dominion raids her temple and steals a sacred relic, warrior Itzil is thrust into a war she never expected — armed with a blade of pure sunlight that hasn't manifested in three hundred years and a prophecy she doesn't believe in.

The Dominion is hunting seven ancient relics that can open a gate sealed for centuries. On the other side: something vast, hungry, and patient. Itzil must gather allies, find the relics first, and become the leader the world needs — even though she's not sure she's the leader anyone wants.

In this book:

A reluctant warrior discovers she can manifest a blade of golden light — and that the blade responds not to strength, but to clarity of purpose
A bitter scout, a flashy duelist, a quiet engineer, and a healer with impossible abilities join forces against an empire
A daring raid behind enemy lines reveals the Dominion's terrifying plans for the ancient Great Gate
A race to secure a sacred relic leads to a face-to-face encounter with the Dominion's most dangerous weapon: a woman who fights with words instead of swords
A war-beast assault tests the team's limits — and proves that showing up is the most powerful thing a person can do

Sunblade Rising is an epic fantasy adventure that combines the warrior traditions of Mesoamerica with the disciplined philosophy of the samurai in a world where empires are built on stolen souls and the only weapon that can stop them is the courage to show up when everything says you shouldn't.

For fans of The Poppy War, The Blade Itself, and The Name of the Wind — a new epic fantasy series that proves the most powerful weapon isn't the sharpest sword. It's the person holding it.

The sun is rising. The blade is lit. And the war has only just begun.

Book 1 of 12 in the Aztec Samurai Adventures series. From Ketan Shukla, published by Metronagon.
