The trap closes. The sky goes dark. And the alliance learns what war really costs.

Fortress Ashfall was supposed to be Volzentar's masterpiece — thirty thousand hidden soldiers, blood-wards on every exit, cascading sorcery designed to destroy the alliance in a single engagement. The alliance walked in knowing it was a trap. They turned it inside out. And the cost of that victory was a third of their army and the discovery that glory dies the moment you hold a dying boy in your arms.

In this book:

A duelist kills a sorcerer in the most intense combat the series has seen — and discovers that the ease of killing is more terrifying than the danger
A scout infiltrates a fortress of blood-magic and breaks the ward network with a vial of purified water — then discovers the enemy has found a vulnerability in his own body
A hawk rider named Skyren dives through a magical storm to rescue wounded soldiers, introducing the alliance's newest and most reckless member
Two neutral nations fall while the alliance is trapped — fifty thousand people ash-oathed in a single day
The Starless Crown appears: a ring of void in the sky, visible evidence that the dimensional barrier is thinning and the Hunger is coming
Volzentar sends a personal message to the Sun-Blade bearer: I know your name. I know the people you love.

The Starless Crown is the final book of Act I — The Rising. The optimism is gone. What replaces it is resolve: hard, cold, unbreakable. The resolve of people who have been told the truth and have decided to fight anyway.

For fans of The Poppy War, The Blade Itself, and The Name of the Wind — a series where the cost of war is measured not in territory but in the silence after the battle, and the hardest thing a warrior can learn is that glory was never real.

The Crown grows. The clock ticks. And the alliance — battered, diminished, changed — prepares for what comes next.

Book 4 of 12 in the Aztec Samurai Adventures series. From Ketan Shukla, published by Metronagon.
