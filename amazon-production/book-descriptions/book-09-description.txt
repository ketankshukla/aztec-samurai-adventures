Nine heroes. Nine memories. One blade. The quiet man no one watched is about to save the world.

The Sun-Blade is shattered. But the armorer has been studying the fragments — and the fragments have been talking back. They're not dead. They're dormant. Waiting to be reforged into something greater.

The price? Each hero must give a piece of their soul.

In this book:

An armorer channels nine people's souls through his hands — and nearly dies creating the most powerful weapon in the world
A parallel rescue mission infiltrates the Dominion's most secure prison through its unwarded river
A scholar reveals the bombs she planted in the villain's stolen knowledge: "He stole my data. But he couldn't steal my judgment."
An entity the size of a continent speaks to the world: "I SEE YOU. ALL OF YOU. AND I AM HUNGRY."
A blade reforged from nine colors blazes against a bleeding sky
The final charge begins

The Forge of Souls opens Act III with the series' most emotionally complex sequence — nine soul-contributions, each one a character study in what people are willing to give up to protect each other. The blade that emerges is not one person's weapon. It's everyone's.

For fans of The Way of Kings, The Name of the Wind, and stories where the quiet person in the background turns out to be the one who matters most — a book about what happens when you listen to the metal.

"I just listened to the metal."

Book 9 of 12 in the Aztec Samurai Adventures series. The first book of Act III: The Reckoning. From Ketan Shukla, published by Metronagon.
