The healer walks into a dimension made of shattered glass. Every mirror is a weapon. Every reflection hides an assassin. And the only way to free thousands of trapped souls is to survive long enough to reach them.

Neyla's ash-oath reversal technique is draining the Great Gate's power — one freed soul at a time. Valdremor's response? Send Mirathane, an assassin who kills through reflections. Any mirror. Any water. Any polished surface. She never fails.

In this book:

A healer enters a fractured glass dimension to free the souls that power the enemy's doomsday weapon
A water-mystic fights a mirror-assassin in the assassin's own domain — water vs. reflections in a realm where physics is a suggestion
Thousands of trapped souls freed in a cascade that shakes the Gate and makes a continent-sized entity SCREAM
A healer looks at the assassin who tried to kill her and says: "I can see what they did to you"
A new sight reveals the truth: Vastrix isn't a creature — it's a dimension. Bigger than the world.
The siege of the Dominion capital begins — and the outer wall falls

The Mirror Queen is the book where compassion becomes a weapon of mass liberation. Neyla's turquoise light doesn't destroy — it reverses. It doesn't attack — it heals. And in a war where the enemy's power comes from stolen souls, healing is the most devastating force on the battlefield.

For fans of The Poppy War, Mistborn, and stories where the healer is the most dangerous person in the room — a book about what happens when you offer an open door to someone who tried to kill you.

"I see you. I'm here. You're going home."
