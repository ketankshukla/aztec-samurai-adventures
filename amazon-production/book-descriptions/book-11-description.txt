Every villain falls. The Gate closes. The Crown shatters. And the blade sings a sound like every sunrise that ever was.

The siege of the Dominion capital reaches its climax. The inner wall. The palace. The Gate plaza. And beyond it all — VASTRIX, pressing through a crack in reality with the force of three thousand years of hunger.

In this book:

A spymaster offered mercy chooses to fall — "I was never the kind of person who takes someone else's hand"
An architect outsmarted by the woman he imprisoned — "Knowledge is only half of wisdom"
An oracle who opened the Gate three thousand years ago volunteers to close it — a one-way trip
Nine soul-threads blaze against a hunger the size of a world
The Starless Crown shatters into a million points of golden light
Dawn breaks. Real dawn. And two people who showed up — every time — find each other in the light

Crown of Stars is the penultimate book of the series — the chapter where every thread converges, every villain meets their fate, and the war that has consumed eleven books reaches its final, devastating, triumphant conclusion. The blade sings. The Crown breaks. The golden snow falls.

For fans of Return of the King, The Last Battle, and stories where the final charge is carried by people who are terrified and have decided that terror is not a sufficient reason to stop.

"You showed up." "I always do."

Book 11 of 12 in the Aztec Samurai Adventures series. The penultimate book of Act III: The Reckoning. From Ketan Shukla, published by Metronagon.
