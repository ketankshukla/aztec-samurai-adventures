Twelve books. One warrior. A blade of pure sunlight. An epic fantasy saga fusing Mesoamerican warrior traditions with samurai philosophy — in a world where empires are built on stolen souls and the only weapon that can stop them is the courage to show up when everything says you shouldn't.

When the Dominion raids her temple, warrior Itzil discovers she can manifest a weapon of golden light unseen for three centuries. The Dominion is hunting seven ancient relics to open a gate sealed for millennia. On the other side: something vast, hungry, and patient. Itzil must gather allies, find the relics first, and become the leader the world needs — even though she's not sure she's the leader anyone wants.

ACT I — THE RISING (Books 1–4)

Book 1: Sunblade Rising — A reluctant warrior discovers her impossible gift and launches a desperate mission behind enemy lines with a team of broken, brilliant strangers.

Book 2: The Mirror Siege — Mirror-portals open across the continent. A lone scout goes behind enemy lines to destroy the source. What he finds is worse than a weapon — it's a prison built from a human soul.

Book 3: Ash Oaths — The war moves from battlefields to ballrooms. A diplomat faces the Dominion's most dangerous negotiator. The true nature of ash-oaths is decoded — they don't just enslave. They fuel the Gate.

Book 4: The Starless Crown — A ring of void appears in the sky. The real enemy reveals itself. The optimism dies. What replaces it is resolve: hard, cold, unbreakable.

ACT II — THE BREAKING (Books 5–8)

Book 5: The Serpent's Gambit — The Architect arrives: smarter, more patient, more terrifying than anything the alliance has faced. He doesn't fight wars. He engineers them.

Book 6: Rain of Obsidian — Obsidian shards fall from the sky. The base is destroyed. The alliance is scattered. The darkest book in the series — and the one that proves what these characters are made of.

Book 7: Feathers and Bone — A shadow master returns to the city she abandoned. A healer frees hundreds. And the sacrifice demanded in this book will break your heart.

Book 8: The Shattered Blade — The blade shatters. The mentor dies. Everything breaks so that everything can be rebuilt. The girl who held the sun discovers what she is without it.

ACT III — THE RECKONING (Books 9–12)

Book 9: The Forge of Souls — Nine heroes give a piece of their soul to reforge the blade. The quiet man no one watched is about to save the world.

Book 10: The Mirror Queen — A healer walks into a dimension of shattered glass where every reflection hides an assassin. Compassion becomes a weapon of mass liberation.

Book 11: Crown of Stars — Every villain falls. The Gate closes. The Crown shatters into a million points of golden light. Dawn breaks — real dawn.

Book 12: The Sun That Never Sets — The war is over. The world is saved. Now comes the harder part: learning to live in the world you saved. The ending is not an explosion. It's a sunrise.

For fans of The Poppy War, The Blade Itself, The Name of the Wind, and Avatar: The Last Airbender — an epic fantasy series that proves the most powerful weapon isn't the sharpest sword. It's the person holding it.

The sun is rising. The blade is lit. And the story of a lifetime awaits.
