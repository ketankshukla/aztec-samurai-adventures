A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover rendered in ultra-high-resolution photorealistic style with cinematic color grading. SUBJECT — AERIAL ACTION PORTRAIT (YOUNG MALE HAWK RIDER): A strikingly handsome young man of indigenous Mesoamerican descent, 18 years old, positioned in the lower-right quadrant of the image (his face centered around 65-75% down from the top, offset slightly right of center). He is captured in exhilarating freefall — having just leaped from his giant spirit-hawk Tlaneci, recurved bow drawn and blazing arrow aimed at a demon-portal below. His body arcs through golden clouds, one hand releasing the bowstring, the other trailing a grappling line back to his hawk. His face splits in a wild, joyous grin — the expression of someone who feels most alive when gravity tries to kill him.

His face radiates youthful beauty and reckless joy — the look of a sky-born warrior who has never met a height that scared him. His sun-browned skin gleams with the gold of sunset clouds and the rush of wind, freckled and weathered by constant sun exposure. His face is captured with hyper-real detail — an infectious wide grin, windswept features, amber flight goggles pushed up onto his forehead leaving tan lines. His feathered helm trails behind him, secured by a chin strap, eagle feathers whipping in the wind.

His eyes are extraordinary — large, bright golden-brown irises that match the sunset, with darker amber striations radiating outward like the pattern of hawk feathers. Natural catchlights — two sharp, luminous reflections — sit in the upper portion of each iris, giving his eyes an almost manic gleam of pure exhilaration. His lashes are sun-bleached and spiky, his eyebrows raised in eternal excitement. His lips are stretched in that fearless grin, wind pulling at his cheeks.

He is boyishly handsome and radiantly alive — the beauty of youth and absolute fearlessness. His skin is bathed in warm golden sunset light from the clouds around him, creating dramatic highlights on his face, while cooler blue sky-light rims his silhouette from above. Every micro-detail is rendered — the way his short hair spikes in the wind, the calluses on his bow fingers, the feather tokens braided into his hair, his giant hawk Tlaneci visible above him, wings spread magnificently.

His recurved bow is a work of art — obsidian-tipped arrows blazing with turquoise fire as he releases. His grappling line trails golden light as it connects him to his hawk. His flight armor is light and aerodynamic — leather and layered feathers designed to catch wind, with hawk-talon clasps at shoulders and belt.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT: The man's face must be positioned entirely BELOW the subtitle text area and ABOVE the author name. His face occupies roughly the 55%-82% vertical zone of the image. The top 45% of the image (where the title and subtitle text will be placed) must contain ONLY the background elements and open space — absolutely NO part of his face, hair, or bow may enter the top 35% of the image.

BACKGROUND — SKIES ABOVE THE DEMON WAR: Behind him and slightly out of focus, the background depicts a vertical battlescape seen from above. Golden sunset clouds swirl around floating temple-ruins that the Dominion has lifted into the sky. His spirit-hawk Tlaneci soars above — a magnificent creature of bronze feathers and turquoise-glowing eyes, three times the size of a man. Below, a demon-portal crackles with dark energy, its silver runes visible. Other hawk riders engage winged demons in aerial combat — streaks of turquoise arrows and ember-fire crisscrossing the sunset sky.
