A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover rendered in ultra-high-resolution photorealistic style with cinematic color grading. SUBJECT — MYSTICAL POWER PORTRAIT (YOUNG MALE WATER MYSTIC): A hauntingly beautiful young man of indigenous Mesoamerican descent, 22 years old, positioned in the lower-right quadrant of the image (his face centered around 65-75% down from the top, offset slightly right of center). He is captured in a moment of devastating power — arms raised, palms open, as massive spiraling walls of turquoise water rise around him like living shields, deflecting a wave of demon-fire. His body seems to float slightly, suspended by the magic flowing through him. His face is tilted back, eyes closed, lips moving in a whispered song — the expression of someone communing with forces older than humanity.

His face radiates otherworldly beauty and dreamy power — the look of a mystic who walks between the waking world and the realm of rain. His bronze skin is marked with blue-green tattoos that trace like rainfall down his temples, across his cheekbones, and along his neck — each drop a glyph of water magic that now glows with active power. His face is captured with hyper-real detail — high cheekbones, full lips parted in song, the faintest shimmer of mist clinging to his skin. His braided hair is threaded with shells that click and chime, each one a focus for his magic.

His eyes are closed in concentration, but the shapes beneath his lids glow with turquoise light, suggesting eyes that have become windows to storms. His lashes are dark against his cheeks, beaded with water droplets. His eyebrows are relaxed despite the chaos, his entire face a study in peaceful destruction. His lips move in a soundless song that commands the waters to rise.

He is ethereally beautiful in a way that feels not quite human — beauty that belongs to rain and rivers and the deep places where water remembers everything. His skin is bathed in the turquoise glow of his own magic, water-light rippling across his features like sunlight through an ocean, while warm ember-light from the deflected demon-fire creates dramatic contrast at the edges. Every micro-detail is rendered — the shell-threaded braids floating weightlessly, the knot-amulets at his wrists pulsing with stored spells, the gourd canteen at his hip (that never empties) glowing from within.

His magic manifests as living water — walls that move like serpents, shields that flow like breath, tendrils that reach to extinguish fires and drown shadows. His simple robes are soaked but flowing, patterned with wave motifs that seem to move in the water-light. He is unarmed in the conventional sense — because he is the weapon.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT: The man's face must be positioned entirely BELOW the subtitle text area and ABOVE the author name. His face occupies roughly the 55%-82% vertical zone of the image. The top 45% of the image (where the title and subtitle text will be placed) must contain ONLY the background elements and open space — absolutely NO part of his face, hair, or magic may enter the top 35% of the image.

BACKGROUND — THE STORM UNLEASHED: Behind him and slightly out of focus, the background depicts a battlefield transformed by water magic. A demon-gate vomits fire and shadow, but his water-walls create a corridor of safety for retreating civilians. Turquoise rain falls upward, defying gravity, drawn by his song. The dry earth blooms with sudden flowers where sacred water touches it. Dominion sorcerers flee from the advancing flood. The scene shows nature itself rising in defense — water remembering it was once worshipped.
