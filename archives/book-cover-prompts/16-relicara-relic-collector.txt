A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover rendered in ultra-high-resolution photorealistic style with cinematic color grading. SUBJECT — OBSESSIVE ELEGANCE PORTRAIT (FEMALE RELIC COLLECTOR): A striking woman of pale European descent, ageless and imperious, positioned in the lower-right quadrant of the image (her face centered around 65-75% down from the top, offset slightly right of center). She is captured examining a stolen sacred relic — an Aztec sun-disc held delicately in long-gloved fingers, her face alight with acquisitive rapture. Her body is draped in the finest textiles, her white hair piled impossibly high and adorned with stolen treasures. Her face wears an expression of pure covetous love — the look of someone who values objects infinitely more than the cultures she steals them from.

Her face radiates cold beauty and refined obsession — the look of a collector who sees genocide as curation. Her porcelain skin is flawless, maintained by magic or vanity, catching the glow of the relic she covets. Her white hair is an architectural achievement — piled high and threaded with stolen jade beads, turquoise fragments, gold ornaments from conquered peoples. Most distinctively, she wears a jeweled moustache — delicate chains of gems curving above her lip in deliberate absurdist aristocracy. Her face is captured with hyper-real detail — sharp features, eyes that appraise value, lips curved in possessive satisfaction.

Her eyes are extraordinary — large, pale violet irises that seem to catalogue and price everything they see, with silver striations radiating outward like the spokes of a display case. Natural catchlights — two sharp, luminous reflections — sit in the upper portion of each iris, giving her eyes a greedy, calculating gleam. Her lashes are pale and long, her eyebrows arched in perpetual superiority. Her smile is for the object, not any person present.

She is terrifyingly beautiful in a refined, untouchable way — beauty as privilege. Her skin is bathed in the warm turquoise-gold glow of the stolen relic, creating highlights that make her seem to own even the light, while cold ambient light rims her elaborate silhouette. Every micro-detail is rendered — the jeweled moustache glittering absurdly, the long gloves preventing any direct contact with her treasures, the relic case at her hip containing other stolen sacred objects.

Her gown is a museum of conquest — woven with patterns stolen from a dozen cultures. Her gloves are necessary because she never touches her collection directly. Her relic case contains horrors disguised as artifacts.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT: The woman's face must be positioned entirely BELOW the subtitle text area and ABOVE the author name. Her face occupies roughly the 55%-82% vertical zone of the image. The top 45% of the image (where the title and subtitle text will be placed) must contain ONLY the background elements and open space — absolutely NO part of her face, hair, or relic may enter the top 35% of the image.

BACKGROUND — THE GALLERY OF STOLEN WORLDS: Behind her and slightly out of focus, the background depicts her private collection — a vast gallery of cultural theft. Display cases hold sacred objects ripped from temples. Portraits of conquered civilizations line the walls like trophies. Some relics glow with unstable energy — rigged to explode if anyone tries to reclaim them. A map shows marked territories — not for conquest, but for "acquisition." The scene shows history murdered — memory made merchandise.

TEXT — MUST BE RENDERED EXACTLY AS SPECIFIED WITH UNIFORM PLACEMENT. DO NOT ALTER IN ANY WAY:

All text placement percentages below are measured from the TOP of the image and must be followed precisely to ensure uniform placement across all covers in the series.

OVERALL MOOD: Cinematic, obsessive, coldly acquisitive — warm relic-glow against cold gallery lighting and stolen treasures. The feeling of watching culture become commodity — the moment when sacred becomes inventory. Photorealistic, refined horror quality, suitable for a bestselling YA epic fantasy book cover.
