A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover rendered in ultra-high-resolution photorealistic style with cinematic color grading. SUBJECT — MAD GENIUS PORTRAIT (MALE DEMON PORTAL ENGINEER): A striking man of pale European descent, middle-aged with manic energy, positioned in the lower-right quadrant of the image (his face centered around 65-75% down from the top, offset slightly right of center). He is captured mid-creation — arms spread wide as reality tears open behind him, a demon gate blooming into existence at his command. His body is wrapped in soot-stained robes covered in geometric calculations. His white hair rises like smoke, his moustache split into two sharp points giving him a devilish appearance. His face wears an expression of delighted curiosity — the look of a scientist who considers apocalypse an acceptable experimental outcome.

His face radiates unsettling beauty and gleeful madness — the look of genius untethered from morality. His pale skin is soot-stained and marked by minor burns from portal proximity, catching the impossible colors bleeding from the gate behind him. His white hair floats upward as if gravity is optional near his work. His split-pointed moustache frames a smile that never stops. His face is captured with hyper-real detail — clever eyes that see dimensions most cannot, soot smudges across his cheek, lips stretched in permanent amusement at the universe's malleability.

His eyes are extraordinary — large, heterochromatic irises, one pale blue and one deep amber, both with geometric striations that echo the impossible angles of his gates. Natural catchlights — two sharp, luminous reflections — sit in each iris, but seem to bend as if refracted through strange geometries. His lashes are singed at the tips, his eyebrows raised in perpetual "isn't this fascinating?" His smile is genuine — he really does find interdimensional horror amusing.

He is terrifyingly beautiful in an eccentric, unstable way — beauty that flickers like bad geometry. His skin is bathed in the impossible colors bleeding from his gate — purples and greens and colors that shouldn't exist, creating highlights that seem wrong, while soot-dark shadows pool in his robes. Every micro-detail is rendered — the geometric calculations scrawled on his soot-stained robes, the way reality bends around his fingertips, his casual stance of someone completely at ease with chaos.

His robes are covered in mathematics that hurts to read. His hands trace geometries in the air that leave afterimages. The gate behind him shows vistas that break minds.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT: The man's face must be positioned entirely BELOW the subtitle text area and ABOVE the author name. His face occupies roughly the 55%-82% vertical zone of the image. The top 45% of the image (where the title and subtitle text will be placed) must contain ONLY the background elements and open space — absolutely NO part of his face, hair, or hands may enter the top 35% of the image.

BACKGROUND — REALITY REWRITTEN: Behind him and slightly out of focus, the background depicts impossible architecture — stairs that go nowhere, doors suspended in midair, windows that open onto places that shouldn't exist. His demon gate dominates the center, a swirling vortex of wrong colors and reaching shadow-limbs. Demons peek through like curious colleagues. The landscape itself seems to warp around his presence. The scene shows reality as suggestion — physics as preference.

TEXT — MUST BE RENDERED EXACTLY AS SPECIFIED WITH UNIFORM PLACEMENT. DO NOT ALTER IN ANY WAY:

All text placement percentages below are measured from the TOP of the image and must be followed precisely to ensure uniform placement across all covers in the series.

Line 1 (exactly 3% from top): "AZTEC SAMURAI ADVENTURES" — small elegant Trajan Pro font, centered horizontally, turquoise color (#40E0D0), letter-spacing 0.15em, approximately 14pt equivalent.

Line 2 (exactly 6% from top): "THE WHITE-MANE DOMINION" — Trajan Pro font, centered, silver color (#C0C0C0), letter-spacing 0.2em, approximately 12pt equivalent. Flanked on the left and right by thin horizontal silver lines extending outward from the text.

Lines 3-4 (title block, exactly 10-22% from top): "THE GATEWRIGHT" — large, elegant Trajan Pro font, centered, white with iridescent undertones that shift between purple and green. Arranged as:
Line 3: "THE"
Line 4: "GATEWRIGHT"

Decorative ornamental line (exactly 24% from top): An elegant silver and iridescent ornamental filigree divider — a thin horizontal line that blooms into impossible geometric scrollwork and portal motifs at the center, with symmetrical key designs tapering to fine points at each end. Rendered in silver (#C0C0C0) with shifting purple-green accents.

Line 5 (exactly 26% from top): "He Speaks to Demons Like Coworkers — They Answer" — smaller italic Trajan Pro, centered, pale iridescent color.

Decorative ornamental line (exactly 28% from top): An identical silver and iridescent ornamental filigree divider matching the one above.

Line 6 (exactly 92% from top): "KETAN SHUKLA" — large Trajan Pro font, centered, white/silver, generous letter-spacing approximately 0.2em.

OVERALL MOOD: Cinematic, geometrically unstable, gleefully apocalyptic — impossible colors against soot-dark robes and broken reality. The feeling of watching someone play with the universe's source code — the moment when a door opens to somewhere that was never meant to be reached. Photorealistic, cosmic horror quality, suitable for a bestselling YA epic fantasy book cover.
