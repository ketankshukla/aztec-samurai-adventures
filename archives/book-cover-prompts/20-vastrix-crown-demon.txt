A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover rendered in ultra-high-resolution photorealistic style with cinematic color grading. SUBJECT — COSMIC HORROR PORTRAIT (THE CROWN-DEMON VASTRIX): An entity of impossible presence, not human but wearing humanity's shadow, positioned in the lower-right quadrant of the image (its face centered around 65-75% down from the top, offset slightly right of center). It is captured in terrible stillness — no gesture, no movement, simply existing with overwhelming presence. Its form suggests a massive humanoid silhouette made of star-black void, with glowing cracks running through it like fissures in reality. A crown of bone floats above its head, each point a different conquered world. Its face — if it can be called that — shows only patience. It has waited eternities. It can wait more.

Its face radiates impossible beauty and absolute finality — the look of something that exists beyond time and considers mortality amusing. Its star-black skin is not skin but absence — the void between stars given form, with glowing cracks running through like magma through obsidian. Its features are almost human, almost beautiful, but wrong in ways the eye refuses to process. No hair, no moustache — it is beyond such things. Its expression is not cruel, not kind — simply patient. Absolute. Final.

Its eyes are extraordinary — not eyes but windows into somewhere else. Deep voids where stars died, rimmed with the faintest ember-glow of devoured light. Looking into them is like looking into the end of everything. No catchlights — it consumes light, does not reflect it. Its face is captured with hyper-real detail — the texture of void-made-solid, the cracks that glow with the last light of consumed suns, the bone crown floating eternally above.

It is terrifyingly beautiful in a cosmic, incomprehensible way — beauty that makes humanity seem temporary. Its form is bathed in the faint ember-glow bleeding from its cracks, creating highlights that should not exist on something that dark, while all light around it seems to bend inward, falling toward it. Every micro-detail is rendered — the bone crown with its twelve points (twelve conquered dimensions), the way shadow bends toward it, the sense that looking at it costs something.

Its bone crown is made from the last kings of worlds that no longer exist. Its voice, when it speaks, sounds like distant thunder delivering a verdict. It does not fight — it waits until you surrender.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT: The entity's face must be positioned entirely BELOW the subtitle text area and ABOVE the author name. Its face occupies roughly the 55%-82% vertical zone of the image. The top 45% of the image (where the title and subtitle text will be placed) must contain ONLY the background elements and open space — absolutely NO part of its face or crown may enter the top 35% of the image.

BACKGROUND — THE END OF EVERYTHING: Behind it and slightly out of focus, the background depicts the void between worlds — not empty but hungry. Stars dim and fall inward. Fragments of conquered realities drift like cosmic debris. The faintest shapes of demon legions mass at the edges, waiting for the word that will end resistance forever. A distant sun flickers and dies. The scene shows entropy personified — the patient end that waits for all things.

TEXT — MUST BE RENDERED EXACTLY AS SPECIFIED WITH UNIFORM PLACEMENT. DO NOT ALTER IN ANY WAY:

All text placement percentages below are measured from the TOP of the image and must be followed precisely to ensure uniform placement across all covers in the series.

Line 3: (empty or very small "THE TZITZIMIMEH-KING")
Line 4: "VASTRIX"

Decorative ornamental line (exactly 24% from top): An elegant silver and ember ornamental filigree divider — a thin horizontal line that blooms into bone-crown scrollwork and star-death motifs at the center, with symmetrical void-crack designs tapering to fine points at each end. Rendered in silver (#C0C0C0) with ember (#FF4500) accents.

Line 5 (exactly 26% from top): "It Feeds on Surrender — And It Has Never Starved" — smaller italic Trajan Pro, centered, pale ember color.

Line 6 (exactly 92% from top): "KETAN SHUKLA" — large Trajan Pro font, centered, white/silver, generous letter-spacing approximately 0.2em.

OVERALL MOOD: Cinematic, cosmically terrifying, absolutely final — ember-crack glow against star-black void and dying light. The feeling of confronting the end itself — the moment when you understand that everything dies, and something is waiting. Photorealistic, cosmic horror quality, suitable for a bestselling YA epic fantasy book cover.
