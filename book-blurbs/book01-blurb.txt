She didn't ask to be chosen. The blade didn't ask for permission.

When the Dominion raids her temple and steals a sacred relic, warrior Itzil is thrust into a war she never expected -- armed with a blade of pure sunlight that hasn't manifested in three hundred years and a prophecy she doesn't believe in.

The Dominion is hunting seven ancient relics that can open a gate sealed for centuries. On the other side: something vast, hungry, and patient. Itzil must gather allies, find the relics first, and become the leader the world needs -- even though she's not sure she's the leader anyone wants.

Epic fantasy that combines the warrior traditions of Mesoamerica with the disciplined philosophy of the samurai. The most powerful weapon isn't the sharpest sword. It's the person holding it.

Book 1 of 12 in the Aztec Samurai Adventures series.
