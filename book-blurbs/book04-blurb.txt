The trap closes. The sky goes dark. And the alliance learns what war really costs.

Fortress Ashfall was supposed to be Volzentar's masterpiece -- thirty thousand hidden soldiers, blood-wards on every exit, cascading sorcery designed to destroy the alliance in a single engagement. The alliance walked in knowing it was a trap. They turned it inside out. And the cost of that victory was a third of their army and the discovery that glory dies the moment you hold a dying boy in your arms.

Two neutral nations fall while the alliance is trapped. Fifty thousand people ash-oathed in a single day. And the Starless Crown appears -- a ring of void in the sky, visible proof that the dimensional barrier is thinning and the Hunger is coming.

The optimism is gone. What replaces it is resolve.
