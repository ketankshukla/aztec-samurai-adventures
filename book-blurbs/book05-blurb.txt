The rescue was his plan. The relic was his weapon. And the enemy you can't see is the enemy you can't beat.

Kaelen designs the most elaborate operation the alliance has attempted -- a counter-trap within a trap, layered with deceptions. The mission: rescue a water-knot mystic from a relic collector's mountain fortress. The result: a success so clean it can only mean the enemy wanted it to happen.

Then Valdremor enters the story. The Architect. The intellectual power behind the Dominion. The man with the crystal eye who designed the ash-oath system, the Gate's activation sequence, and the mechanism that will end the world.

Dominion communications go dark. The silence before the storm. The cleverness that saved the alliance meets an opponent who is smarter, more patient, and more terrifying.
