The sky turns black. The rain is glass. And everything the heroes built comes crashing down.

Valdremor's assault hits at dawn -- obsidian shards falling from the sky like a curtain of razors, cutting through every defense the alliance has built. The base is destroyed. The alliance is scattered into three groups fleeing in three directions. And Nightshade walks through the chaos to take the one person the heroes can't afford to lose.

A grandmaster fights his last fight -- six minutes of perfection from a body that has nothing left to give. A healer discovers how to break the unbreakable. And a prophecy names the most unlikely hero: an armorer no one is watching.

The darkest book in the series. Everything falls. But in the falling, the heroes discover what they're made of.

Book 6 of 12 in the Aztec Samurai Adventures series.
