A shadow master returns to the city she abandoned. A healer frees a city. And the first beloved hero falls.

Miyako has carried the guilt for decades. She ran from her home when the war came. The people she left behind were enslaved. Now, with nothing left to lose and everything left to prove, she goes back -- into a city-sized ash-oath factory where people move in perfect order and no one laughs.

A healer frees over two hundred people in a single morning and breaks when she realizes it's not enough. A shadow master descends into a temple basement, destroys the anchor that enslaves a city, and fights through twenty guards to reach the light. Four words scratched into a wall crack a villain's certainty: "I REMEMBER MY NAME."

Then comes the death that changes everything.
