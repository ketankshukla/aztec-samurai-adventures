The blade breaks. The mentor dies. And the girl who held the sun discovers what she is without it.

Itzil races south to claim the last sacred relic before the Dominion can seize it. She enters an ancient temple that tests her soul -- three fears, three truths, no mercy. She passes. She claims the Sunheart. She emerges into a battle she wasn't prepared for.

The duel of the series: Sun-Blade bearer vs. blood-magic spymaster. The Sun-Blade shatters -- destroyed from within by a corrosion spell no one saw coming. A commander fights without her weapon and discovers the weapon was never the point.

The lowest point becomes the launch pad. The girl in the dark becomes the leader who doesn't need the light.

"Just you is enough."
