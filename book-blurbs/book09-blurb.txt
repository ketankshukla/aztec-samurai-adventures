Nine heroes. Nine memories. One blade. The quiet man no one watched is about to save the world.

The Sun-Blade is shattered. But the armorer has been studying the fragments -- and the fragments have been talking back. They're not dead. They're dormant. Waiting to be reforged into something greater.

The price? Each hero must give a piece of their soul.

Nine soul-contributions. Each one a character study in what people are willing to give up to protect each other. A parallel rescue mission infiltrates the Dominion's most secure prison. A scholar reveals the bombs she planted in the villain's stolen knowledge. And an entity the size of a continent speaks: "I SEE YOU. ALL OF YOU. AND I AM HUNGRY."

A blade reforged from nine colors blazes against a bleeding sky. The final charge begins.
