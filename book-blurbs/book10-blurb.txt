The healer walks into a dimension made of shattered glass. Every mirror is a weapon. Every reflection hides an assassin. And the only way to free thousands of trapped souls is to survive long enough to reach them.

Neyla's ash-oath reversal technique is draining the Great Gate's power -- one freed soul at a time. Valdremor's response? Send Mirathane, an assassin who kills through reflections. Any mirror. Any water. Any polished surface. She never fails.

A water-mystic fights a mirror-assassin in her own domain. Thousands of trapped souls are freed in a cascade that makes a continent-sized entity scream. And Neyla looks at the assassin who tried to kill her and says: "I can see what they did to you."

Compassion becomes a weapon of mass liberation.
