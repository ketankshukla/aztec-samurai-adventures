Every villain falls. The Gate closes. The Crown shatters. And the blade sings a sound like every sunrise that ever was.

The siege of the Dominion capital reaches its climax. The inner wall. The palace. The Gate plaza. And beyond it all -- VASTRIX, pressing through a crack in reality with the force of three thousand years of hunger.

A spymaster offered mercy chooses to fall. An architect is outsmarted by the woman he imprisoned. An oracle who opened the Gate three thousand years ago volunteers to close it -- a one-way trip. Nine soul-threads blaze against a hunger the size of a world.

The Starless Crown shatters into a million points of golden light. Dawn breaks. Real dawn. And two people who showed up -- every time -- find each other in the light.
