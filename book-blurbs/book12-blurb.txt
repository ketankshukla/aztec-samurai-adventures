The war is over. The world is saved. Now comes the harder part: figuring out what to do with the world you saved.

The Gate is rubble. The Crown is golden snow. The sky is clear for the first time in years. And nine heroes who gave everything to save the world must now learn to live in it.

A healer frees the last slaves. A duelist walks the battlefield counting the dead -- because someone should. An engineer draws blueprints by candlelight -- not for weapons, but for homes. A commander refuses a crown: "I didn't fight a tyrant to become one."

Names carved in obsidian -- heroes and villains together. A house with a view. Morning training. Evening walks. The ordinary miracle.

"Show up. Give willingly. Choose each other."

Book 12 of 12 -- the conclusion of the Aztec Samurai Adventures series.
