A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover rendered in ultra-high-resolution photorealistic style with cinematic color grading. SUBJECT — DYNAMIC ACTION PORTRAIT (WARRIOR WOMAN): A breathtakingly beautiful young woman of indigenous Mesoamerican descent in her early 20s, positioned in the lower-right quadrant of the image (her face centered around 65-75% down from the top, offset slightly right of center). She is captured mid-strike in a devastating diagonal slash — her jade-obsidian katana blazing with golden sunfire as it cleaves through shadow. Her body twists with lethal grace, shoulders torqued, left arm extended behind her for balance, right arm driving the blade forward in an arc of righteous fury. Her face is turned toward the viewer, chin lifted, eyes locked on an unseen enemy — the expression of a commander who has already decided the outcome.

Her face radiates fierce beauty and unstoppable resolve — not rage, but the calm, burning certainty of someone who protects what she loves. Her warm bronze skin gleams with the sheen of battle, caught between turquoise mystical light from above and the golden glow emanating from her blade. Her face is captured with hyper-real detail — flawless yet battle-tested skin with visible pores across her nose and cheeks, the faintest sheen of exertion on her brow, a small crescent-shaped scar visible at her left collarbone that speaks of battles survived. Her eyebrows are strong and naturally shaped, slightly furrowed in warrior focus, with individual hairs visible.

Her eyes are wide and blazing — large, striking obsidian-flecked irises that seem to contain volcanic glass and starlight, with golden striations radiating outward from the pupil like fractures in ancient amber. Natural catchlights — two sharp, luminous reflections — sit in the upper portion of each iris, giving her eyes a deep, fierce, almost supernatural intensity. Her lashes are thick and dark, naturally fanned, each individually visible. Her lips are full, naturally terracotta-pink, parted in a battle cry of defiant power — teeth slightly visible, the shout of a sun-warrior unleashing devastation.

She is stunningly gorgeous yet radiates primal strength and earned authority — no softness, only lethal grace and ancient fire. Her skin is bathed in turquoise mystical light from above, creating luminous highlights on her forehead, the bridge of her nose, and her high cheekbones, while warm golden light from her blade casts ember-tones along her jaw and neck. Every micro-detail is rendered — a tiny beauty mark near her right temple, the way individual strands of her long raven-black hair whip behind her with the force of her strike, each braid threaded with turquoise beads and tiny gold rings that catch the light like scattered stars.

Her hair flows explosively behind her — freed from stillness by her attack — individual strands visible and luminous, some braids still intact while others have loosened into wild cascades. A magnificent feathered crest of quetzal greens and deep sapphire blues is pinned to her lacquered shoulder guard, the iridescent feathers trailing behind her like a warrior's banner. She wears layered armor of obsidian-flecked lacquered plates over richly patterned textiles — gold filigree tracing sun-disc patterns across her chest guard. Her jade-obsidian katana features a sun-disc tsuba that blazes with golden light, the blade itself a seamless fusion of volcanic glass and jade-green steel.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT: The woman's face must be positioned entirely BELOW the subtitle text area and ABOVE the author name. Her face occupies roughly the 55%-82% vertical zone of the image. The top 45% of the image (where the title and subtitle text will be placed) must contain ONLY the background elements and open space — absolutely NO part of her face, hair, feathers, or blade may enter the top 35% of the image. This ensures the title text zone is completely clear of the portrait.

BACKGROUND — THE DEMON GATE SHATTERS: Behind her and slightly out of focus, the background depicts a cataclysmic battle at the threshold of a demon gate. An enormous obsidian archway — carved with silver runes and dripping with shadow-fire — cracks and splinters as golden sunlight blazes through its fractures. The gate is collapsing, turquoise energy and golden light warring against the ink-black void beyond. Silhouettes of white-haired sorcerers in smoke-capes recoil from the devastation, their mirror-masks shattering.

Demon-shadows with ember eyes dissolve into ash and turquoise sparks as the sun-magic overwhelms them. Fragments of obsidian and shattered rune-stones float in the air, suspended by the magical shockwave. Behind the collapsing gate, a glimpse of the homeland — terraced temples, jade-green jungles, a distant pyramid touched by dawn light — represents everything she fights to protect. Volumetric golden and turquoise light rays stream through the cracks in the gate, creating dramatic god-rays against the deep obsidian darkness. Tiny turquoise particles, golden embers, and luminous dust motes swirl throughout the entire scene like sacred fireflies.
