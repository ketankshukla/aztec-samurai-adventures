A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover rendered in ultra-high-resolution photorealistic style with cinematic color grading. SUBJECT — DYNAMIC STEALTH PORTRAIT (YOUNG MALE SCOUT): A strikingly handsome young man of indigenous Mesoamerican descent, 19 years old, positioned in the lower-right quadrant of the image (his face centered around 65-75% down from the top, offset slightly right of center). He is captured in a dramatic crouching leap — bursting from shadow into moonlit turquoise mist, his collapsible spear extended mid-thrust toward an unseen target. His body is coiled like his namesake serpent, one leg bent beneath him, the other extended behind, every muscle taut with explosive potential. His face is angled toward the viewer with a razor-sharp grin — the expression of someone who thrives in danger and dares fate to catch him.

His face radiates roguish beauty and fearless cunning — the look of a scout who has already mapped every escape route before entering. His lean bronze skin catches turquoise moonlight and the faint glow of smoke pellets dissolving around him. His face is captured with hyper-real detail — smooth yet weathered skin with visible pores, the faintest sheen of adrenaline across his brow. His shaved sides reveal the sharp angles of his skull, while a high topknot of jet-black hair whips behind him like a dark banner. Black serpent spiral face paint coils from his left temple across his cheekbone to his jaw — each line crisp and deliberate.

His eyes are extraordinary — large quicksilver irises that seem to shift between mercury and pale jade depending on the light, with darker striations spiraling inward like a viper's scales. Natural catchlights — two sharp, luminous reflections — sit in the upper portion of each iris, giving his eyes an almost predatory gleam. His lashes are dark and defined, his eyebrows sharp and expressive, one slightly raised in perpetual challenge. His lips are curved in that signature daring smirk, parted slightly as if about to whisper "yeah?" to whatever death awaits.

He is devastatingly handsome yet radiates restless energy and coiled menace — the beauty of a blade hidden in silk. His skin is bathed in cool turquoise light from the moon above, creating luminous highlights on his forehead, the bridge of his nose, and his sharp cheekbones, while deep shadows pool beneath his jaw and in the hollows of his throat. Every micro-detail is rendered — the way smoke curls around his fingers, the glint of his mirror-shard compass hanging at his belt (pointing toward something unseen), the texture of his lightweight infiltration gear.

His collapsible spear gleams with obsidian-tipped deadliness, the shaft etched with serpent glyphs that seem to writhe in the dim light. Smoke pellets burst around him in trails of turquoise and shadow-grey, creating a dynamic swirl of concealment. He wears dark fitted cloth armor designed for silence — layered panels that absorb light, with a serpent-scale pattern barely visible in the turquoise glow.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT: The man's face must be positioned entirely BELOW the subtitle text area and ABOVE the author name. His face occupies roughly the 55%-82% vertical zone of the image. The top 45% of the image (where the title and subtitle text will be placed) must contain ONLY the background elements and open space — absolutely NO part of his face, hair, or weapon may enter the top 35% of the image.

BACKGROUND — ENEMY ENCAMPMENT AT MIDNIGHT: Behind him and slightly out of focus, the background depicts a Dominion war camp shrouded in unnatural mist. Pale tents marked with silver runes glow faintly. Silhouettes of white-haired sentries patrol unaware. A massive mirror-portal shimmers in the distance — the target of his infiltration. Turquoise moonlight filters through twisted trees, casting long shadows. Faint ember-lights from demon-hound eyes glow in the far darkness. The entire scene conveys the moment just before chaos — the last breath of silence before the scout strikes.
