A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover rendered in ultra-high-resolution photorealistic style with cinematic color grading. SUBJECT — DYNAMIC INVENTOR PORTRAIT (YOUNG FEMALE ENGINEER): A strikingly beautiful young woman of indigenous Mesoamerican descent, 21 years old, positioned in the lower-right quadrant of the image (her face centered around 65-75% down from the top, offset slightly right of center). She is captured in a moment of brilliant creation — her sun-lens gauntlet raised and blazing with concentrated golden light as she activates a massive glyph-trap beneath an advancing demon horde. Her body is braced in a wide stance, one arm thrust forward channeling the beam, the other pulling a knot-caster spool that trails luminous turquoise thread-glyphs into the air. Her face is lit from below by her own invention, eyes wide with exhilarated focus — the expression of a genius watching her calculations become devastation.

Her face radiates clever beauty and stubborn optimism — the look of someone who sees problems as puzzles begging to be solved. Her warm bronze skin glows with the reflected light of her creation, freckles scattered across her nose and cheeks like constellations. Her face is captured with hyper-real detail — natural skin with visible pores, ink stains on her fingers and a smudge near her left eyebrow, the slight furrow of concentration between her brows. Her hair is practical — braid-wrapped and secured with jade pins, a few escaped strands framing her face and catching the golden light.

Her eyes are extraordinary — large, warm amber irises flecked with copper and gold, radiating outward like the gears of a complex mechanism. Natural catchlights — two sharp, luminous reflections — sit in the upper portion of each iris, giving her eyes a brilliant, calculating gleam. Her lashes are dark and full, her eyebrows expressive and slightly raised in that moment of "it's working!" Her lips are curved in a smile of pure intellectual joy — the grin of an inventor whose creation exceeds expectations.

She is radiantly beautiful yet approachable and real — freckled, ink-stained, gloriously imperfect. Her skin is bathed in warm golden light from her gauntlet below, creating dramatic uplight on her chin, cheeks, and the underside of her brows, while cool turquoise ambient light from the glyph-threads creates rim lighting around her silhouette. Every micro-detail is rendered — the tool-belts wrapped around her waist and thigh, the compact crossbow strapped to her back, the way knot-amulets dangle from her belt clicking with stored spells.

Her sun-lens gauntlet is a marvel of engineering — brass and obsidian fitted with a crystalline lens that focuses sunlight into a cutting beam. Her layered cloth armor is practical rather than ornate, covered in pouches and loops for tools. Glyph-threads spiral from her knot-caster spool, each knot glowing with a different color — turquoise for shield, gold for bind, white for reveal.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT: The woman's face must be positioned entirely BELOW the subtitle text area and ABOVE the author name. Her face occupies roughly the 55%-82% vertical zone of the image. The top 45% of the image (where the title and subtitle text will be placed) must contain ONLY the background elements and open space — absolutely NO part of her face, hair, or equipment may enter the top 35% of the image.

BACKGROUND — BRIDGE OF LIGHT OVER CHAOS: Behind her and slightly out of focus, the background depicts a battlefield being transformed by her engineering. A massive glowing bridge of glyph-light spans a chasm where a demon gate tried to open — her creation sealing the rift. Turquoise geometric patterns pulse through the structure like a heartbeat. Below, demon-shadows claw uselessly at barriers of woven light. Sun-lenses mounted on siege towers focus beams that cut through enemy formations. The scene shows magic and engineering united — ancient wisdom made tactical.

TEXT — MUST BE RENDERED EXACTLY AS SPECIFIED WITH UNIFORM PLACEMENT. DO NOT ALTER IN ANY WAY:

All text placement percentages below are measured from the TOP of the image and must be followed precisely to ensure uniform placement across all covers in the series.

Line 3: "ASH"
Line 4: "OATHS"

Decorative ornamental line (exactly 24% from top): An elegant gold and turquoise ornamental filigree divider — a thin horizontal line that blooms into Aztec-inspired geometric scrollwork and interlocking knot patterns at the center, with symmetrical gear-like motifs tapering to fine points at each end.

OVERALL MOOD: Cinematic, innovative, blazing with creative power — warm gold invention-light against turquoise magic and battlefield chaos. The feeling of watching genius reshape reality — the moment when a single brilliant mind turns the tide of war. Photorealistic, inspiring quality, suitable for a bestselling YA epic fantasy book cover.
