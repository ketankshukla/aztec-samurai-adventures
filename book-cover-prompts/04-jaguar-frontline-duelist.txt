A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover rendered in ultra-high-resolution photorealistic style with cinematic color grading. SUBJECT — EXPLOSIVE COMBAT PORTRAIT (MALE CHAMPION WARRIOR): A magnificently powerful young man of indigenous Mesoamerican descent, 24 years old, positioned in the lower-right quadrant of the image (his face centered around 65-75% down from the top, offset slightly right of center). He is captured at the apex of a devastating overhead strike — his heavy katana blazing with amber fire as it descends toward a demon-general below. His body is a sculpture of coiled power, muscles tensed beneath his jaguar-pelt mantle, clawed buckler raised on his left arm catching an incoming blow. His face is turned toward the viewer in a roar of primal fury — the expression of a champion who fights not just to win, but to terrify.

His face radiates savage beauty and overwhelming presence — the look of a predator who has never known defeat. His deep bronze skin gleams with battle-sweat and reflected amber firelight, the bold geometric jaguar markings painted across his face in gold and black emphasizing the fierce architecture of his features. His face is captured with hyper-real detail — powerful bone structure, a strong jaw clenched in battle-fury, the bridge of his nose broad and proud. A gold nose ring catches the light like a crown.

His eyes are extraordinary — large, intense amber irises with black striations that radiate outward like a jaguar's eye, pupils contracted to fierce slits in the heat of combat. Natural catchlights — two sharp, luminous reflections — sit in the upper portion of each iris, giving his eyes an almost supernatural predatory gleam. His lashes are dark and thick, his eyebrows heavy and drawn together in a thunderous scowl of focused aggression. His lips are pulled back in a warrior's roar, teeth bared, the ceremonial whistle clenched between them releasing a piercing note that signals the charge.

He is devastatingly handsome in a primal, dangerous way — all power and controlled violence. His skin is bathed in warm amber light from his blazing blade, creating dramatic highlights on his forehead, cheekbones, and the corded muscles of his neck, while cooler turquoise ambient light rims his silhouette against the chaos behind. Every micro-detail is rendered — the way his jaguar-pelt mantle flows behind him like living shadow, spots catching the light, the ceremonial scars on his shoulders marking victories, the gold bands around his biceps.

His heavy katana is a weapon of terrifying beauty — dark steel with amber-gold edge, the blade wreathed in flame-like energy. His clawed buckler is forged to resemble a jaguar's paw, the "claws" razor-sharp and already bloodied. His dark lacquered plate armor gleams beneath the pelt, each piece etched with prowling jaguar motifs.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT: The man's face must be positioned entirely BELOW the subtitle text area and ABOVE the author name. His face occupies roughly the 55%-82% vertical zone of the image. The top 45% of the image (where the title and subtitle text will be placed) must contain ONLY the background elements and open space — absolutely NO part of his face, hair, or weapon may enter the top 35% of the image.

BACKGROUND — THE CHAMPION'S DUEL: Behind him and slightly out of focus, the background depicts a massive single-combat arena formed by circled warriors — both allies and enemies watching the decisive duel. Demon-hounds strain at chains held by white-haired handlers. A Dominion beast-general (the Moustached Wolf) faces him across the killing ground, silver armor gleaming. Turquoise banners of the Sun-Blade Confederacy snap in hot wind. Ember-sparks and dust swirl in the air. The scene captures the moment before collision — two apex predators about to determine the battle's fate.
