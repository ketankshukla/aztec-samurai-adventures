A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover rendered in ultra-high-resolution photorealistic style with cinematic color grading. SUBJECT — SERENE POWER PORTRAIT (YOUNG FEMALE HEALER): A breathtakingly beautiful young woman of indigenous Mesoamerican descent, 20 years old, positioned in the lower-right quadrant of the image (her face centered around 65-75% down from the top, offset slightly right of center). She is captured in a moment of fierce compassion — kneeling over a fallen warrior, both hands pressed to his chest as turquoise healing light blazes from her glyph-thread bandages, her face lifted toward an approaching demon with an expression of absolute defiance. Her body is positioned protectively over her patient, small dagger drawn and held ready in one luminous hand. Her face shows no fear — only the unshakable calm of someone who will not let death take what she guards.

Her face radiates gentle beauty and iron resolve — the look of a healer who has stared into pain's abyss and chosen love over despair. Her soft bronze skin glows with the turquoise light emanating from her healing magic, creating an almost ethereal luminescence. Her face is captured with hyper-real detail — delicate features, calm eyes that see everything without flinching, full lips pressed together in quiet determination. Her expression is the most powerful thing about her — maternal ferocity, compassionate steel.

Her eyes are extraordinary — large, deep brown irises with rings of warm honey-gold near the pupil, radiating outward like ripples in still water. Natural catchlights — two sharp, luminous reflections — sit in the upper portion of each iris, giving her eyes a gentle, knowing gleam that seems to look directly into souls. Her lashes are long and dark, her eyebrows soft but determined. Her lips are naturally rose-pink, neither smiling nor frowning — the expression of someone conserving all energy for what matters.

She is quietly stunning — beauty that comes from inner light rather than adornment. Her skin is bathed in cool turquoise healing-light from below and within, creating an otherworldly glow on her features, while warm gold light from distant fires rims her silhouette. Every micro-detail is rendered — jade beads at her wrists glowing with stored healing energy, the way her white-and-turquoise robe ripples around her, herb satchel at her hip, the blood on her hands that is not her own.

Her glyph-thread bandages trail from her fingers like luminous ribbons, each knot pulsing with life-restoring magic. Her light armor is practical, worn beneath flowing robes — she is no stranger to battle, only to causing harm. Her small dagger gleams — last resort made beautiful, jade-handled and sharp.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT: The woman's face must be positioned entirely BELOW the subtitle text area and ABOVE the author name. Her face occupies roughly the 55%-82% vertical zone of the image. The top 45% of the image (where the title and subtitle text will be placed) must contain ONLY the background elements and open space — absolutely NO part of her face, hair, or hands may enter the top 35% of the image.

BACKGROUND — HEALING LIGHT IN DARKNESS: Behind her and slightly out of focus, the background depicts a battlefield medical station under siege. Wounded warriors lie on pallets, some sitting up to watch her stand against the approaching shadow. A demon-hound dissolves at the edge of her healing light — the turquoise glow burning corruption like dawn burning fog. Other healers work frantically in the background. A temple burns in the distance, but closer, a ring of protection holds. The scene shows compassion as a weapon — love as a force that demons cannot comprehend.
