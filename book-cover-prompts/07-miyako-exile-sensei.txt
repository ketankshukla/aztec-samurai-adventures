A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover rendered in ultra-high-resolution photorealistic style with cinematic color grading. SUBJECT — MASTERFUL STILLNESS PORTRAIT (FEMALE SWORD-MASTER): A strikingly beautiful woman of East Asian descent, 31 years old, positioned in the lower-right quadrant of the image (her face centered around 65-75% down from the top, offset slightly right of center). She is captured in the perfect stillness before a lethal strike — her plain blade held in a flawless two-handed high guard, body angled in classical stance, every line of her form expressing decades of discipline. Her face is serene, eyes half-lidded, seeing through her opponent rather than at them — the expression of a master who has already ended the fight in her mind.

Her face radiates mature beauty and absolute calm — the look of someone who has transcended ego and found peace in the blade. Her smooth olive skin carries the warmth of sun and the coolness of discipline, a single silver streak running through her black hair like a badge of wisdom earned. Her face is captured with hyper-real detail — serene features, the faintest lines at the corners of her eyes from years of squinting against sun and studying students, full lips neither smiling nor frowning. Her expression is the most terrifying thing about her — total peace in the face of violence.

Her eyes are extraordinary — large, deep black-brown irises that seem to absorb light rather than reflect it, with depths that appear infinite. Natural catchlights — two sharp, luminous reflections — sit in the upper portion of each iris, but seem muted, as if her inner stillness dampens even light. Her lashes are dark and elegant, her eyebrows perfectly groomed, the architecture of her face classical and timeless. Her lips are naturally mauve, relaxed, breath perfectly controlled.

She is stunningly beautiful in an ageless, transcendent way — beauty that comes from mastery rather than youth. Her skin is bathed in cool turquoise moonlight from above, creating luminous highlights on her forehead and cheekbones, while warm amber light from a distant temple lamp creates depth in the shadows. Every micro-detail is rendered — the silver streak in her hair catching light like a blade, the simple indigo kimono under light armor flowing with hidden weight, the reed-fiber sandals grounded perfectly, the small bamboo flute tucked in her obi.

Her plain blade is the most unassuming and terrifying weapon on any cover — no ornamentation, no glow, just perfect steel that has never chipped. Her stance is textbook — and therefore unpredictable, because she has mastered every form and can flow into any of them. Her simple indigo kimono suggests humility; her light armor beneath suggests she takes no chances.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT: The woman's face must be positioned entirely BELOW the subtitle text area and ABOVE the author name. Her face occupies roughly the 55%-82% vertical zone of the image. The top 45% of the image (where the title and subtitle text will be placed) must contain ONLY the background elements and open space — absolutely NO part of her face, hair, or blade may enter the top 35% of the image.

BACKGROUND — THE DOJO OF STARLIGHT: Behind her and slightly out of focus, the background depicts a moonlit training ground at the edge of a reed-lined shore. Turquoise moonlight ripples across still water. Her students — silhouettes of the young heroes — stand in formation, watching their sensei prepare to demonstrate. A single Dominion assassin (the Luminant Monk's servant) lies already defeated at the edge of the frame. Bamboo sways in night wind. The scene is peaceful, sacred — a moment of teaching that became a moment of protection.

TEXT — MUST BE RENDERED EXACTLY AS SPECIFIED WITH UNIFORM PLACEMENT. DO NOT ALTER IN ANY WAY:

OVERALL MOOD: Cinematic, contemplative, lethally serene — cool turquoise moonlight against deep indigo shadows and still water. The feeling of witnessing perfection made human — the moment when stillness becomes more dangerous than motion. Photorealistic, masterful quality, suitable for a bestselling YA epic fantasy book cover.
