A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover rendered in ultra-high-resolution photorealistic style with cinematic color grading. SUBJECT — ELEGANT INTRIGUE PORTRAIT (MALE DIPLOMAT-SPY): A strikingly handsome young man of indigenous Mesoamerican descent, 26 years old, positioned in the lower-right quadrant of the image (his face centered around 65-75% down from the top, offset slightly right of center). He is captured at a moment of dangerous revelation — his ornate fan half-raised, partially concealing a knowing smile, while his other hand holds a glowing contract that is dissolving into golden sparks as he breaks its binding magic. His body is angled in sophisticated nonchalance, but every line speaks of coiled readiness. His face shows the exact expression of a spy who has just turned an enemy's weapon against them — amused, lethal, immaculate.

His face radiates aristocratic beauty and razor-sharp intelligence — the look of a man who wins wars without ever drawing a blade. His refined bronze skin is flawless, catching candlelight and turquoise magic-glow with equal grace. His face is captured with hyper-real detail — elegant bone structure, perfectly groomed appearance, gold earrings that catch light like signals, eyes that calculate fifteen moves ahead. His smile is the most dangerous thing about him — charming, knowing, never quite reaching his eyes.

His eyes are extraordinary — large, dark amber irises with gold flecks that seem to shift and dance like firelight reflected in still wine. Natural catchlights — two sharp, luminous reflections — sit in the upper portion of each iris, giving his eyes a mesmerizing, almost hypnotic quality. His lashes are dark and elegant, his eyebrows perfectly arched with a hint of sardonic amusement. His lips curve in that signature half-smile — the expression of someone who always knows more than he reveals.

He is devastatingly handsome in a refined, courtly way — beauty wielded like a weapon. His skin is bathed in warm candlelight from one side and cool turquoise magic-light from the dissolving contract, creating a dynamic interplay of shadow and illumination that makes him seem to exist between worlds. Every micro-detail is rendered — the layered textiles with subtle armor plates, the coded prayer-book visible at his belt, the ink-vial (that reveals hidden contracts) hanging at his hip, the gold thread in his immaculate garments.

His fan is a work of art — painted with what appear to be decorative scenes but are actually coded maps and intelligence. His garments are the finest quality, designed to blend in royal courts while concealing throwing blades and emergency glyph-threads. He is dressed to kill — in every sense.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT: The man's face must be positioned entirely BELOW the subtitle text area and ABOVE the author name. His face occupies roughly the 55%-82% vertical zone of the image. The top 45% of the image (where the title and subtitle text will be placed) must contain ONLY the background elements and open space — absolutely NO part of his face, hair, or accessories may enter the top 35% of the image.

BACKGROUND — THE DOMINION COURT UNMASKED: Behind him and slightly out of focus, the background depicts a Dominion throne room in chaos. White-haired nobles in silver-runed finery realize their contracts are failing. Mirror-portals crack and shatter. Lady Pearlvaine (the demon-diplomat) stares in horror as her web of "comfort" bindings dissolve. Guards move toward him, but he is already turning toward the shadows. The scene shows the moment a spy's work is revealed — and he is savoring every second.
