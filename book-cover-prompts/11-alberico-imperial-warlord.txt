A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover rendered in ultra-high-resolution photorealistic style with cinematic color grading. SUBJECT — MENACING VILLAIN PORTRAIT (MALE IMPERIAL WARLORD): A towering, devastatingly handsome man of pale European descent, age indeterminate but radiating ancient power, positioned in the lower-right quadrant of the image (his face centered around 65-75% down from the top, offset slightly right of center). He is captured in a moment of theatrical cruelty — one armored hand raised in a commanding gesture as his troops advance behind him, his massive sword planted point-down before him like a throne. His body is wrapped in black-and-silver armor with an impossibly high collar, his presence filling the frame with overwhelming menace. His face wears an expression of amused contempt — the look of someone who considers genocide a minor inconvenience.

His face radiates cruel beauty and absolute authority — the look of a conqueror who has never been denied. His pale skin is flawless, almost luminous in its pallor, catching silver moonlight like marble. His long, flowing white hair cascades past his shoulders like a frozen waterfall, each strand seeming to move independently. His enormous moustache is curled at the ends like scorpion tails — sharp, theatrical, deliberately intimidating. His face is captured with hyper-real detail — aristocratic bone structure, a strong jaw, lips curved in a sneer that promises suffering.

His eyes are extraordinary — large, pale ice-blue irises that seem to lack all warmth, ringed with silver striations that radiate outward like cracks in frozen lakes. Natural catchlights — two sharp, luminous reflections — sit in the upper portion of each iris, but seem cold, predatory. His lashes are white like his hair, his eyebrows sharp and contemptuous. His smile never reaches his eyes — it is performance, not pleasure.

He is terrifyingly handsome in an inhuman way — beauty weaponized into intimidation. His skin is bathed in cold silver moonlight, creating harsh highlights on his cheekbones and the bridge of his nose, while deep shadows pool in the hollows of his face. Every micro-detail is rendered — the intricate silver runes etched into his black armor, the way his smoke-cape billows unnaturally, the high collar framing his face like a throne's back.

His armor is a masterwork of intimidation — black metal with silver inlay, runes that pulse with cold light, a high collar that makes him seem inhuman. His massive sword is not for show — it has ended kingdoms. His presence alone seems to drain color from the surroundings.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT: The man's face must be positioned entirely BELOW the subtitle text area and ABOVE the author name. His face occupies roughly the 55%-82% vertical zone of the image. The top 45% of the image (where the title and subtitle text will be placed) must contain ONLY the background elements and open space — absolutely NO part of his face, hair, or armor may enter the top 35% of the image.

BACKGROUND — THE DOMINION ADVANCES: Behind him and slightly out of focus, the background depicts a conquered city burning. White-haired soldiers in silver-runed armor march in perfect formation. Banners bearing the Dominion's sigil (a bone crown over crossed contracts) snap in hot wind. Demon-gates shimmer in the distance, disgorging fresh horrors. Refugees flee — those who can. The scene shows empire as extinction — civilization as erasure.

TEXT — MUST BE RENDERED EXACTLY AS SPECIFIED WITH UNIFORM PLACEMENT. DO NOT ALTER IN ANY WAY:

All text placement percentages below are measured from the TOP of the image and must be followed precisely to ensure uniform placement across all covers in the series.

Line 1 (exactly 3% from top): "AZTEC SAMURAI ADVENTURES" — small elegant Trajan Pro font, centered horizontally, turquoise color (#40E0D0), letter-spacing 0.15em, approximately 14pt equivalent.

Line 3: "THE PALE"
Line 4: "BANNER"

Decorative ornamental line (exactly 24% from top): An elegant silver and black ornamental filigree divider — a thin horizontal line that blooms into Dominion-inspired geometric scrollwork and scorpion-tail moustache motifs at the center, with symmetrical bone-crown designs tapering to fine points at each end. Rendered in silver (#C0C0C0) with black accents.

Line 5 (exactly 26% from top): "Empires Rise on the Bones of Those Who Resist" — smaller italic Trajan Pro, centered, pale silver color.

Line 6 (exactly 92% from top): "KETAN SHUKLA" — large Trajan Pro font, centered, white/silver, generous letter-spacing approximately 0.2em.

OVERALL MOOD: Cinematic, menacing, overwhelmingly oppressive — cold silver moonlight against black armor and burning cities. The feeling of watching death crowned — the moment when hope seems impossible and tyranny seems eternal. Photorealistic, villain-origin quality, suitable for a bestselling YA epic fantasy book cover.
