A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover rendered in ultra-high-resolution photorealistic style with cinematic color grading. SUBJECT — SEDUCTIVE VILLAIN PORTRAIT (FEMALE BLOOD ORATOR): A hauntingly beautiful woman of pale European descent, appearing eternally youthful yet ancient in her eyes, positioned in the lower-right quadrant of the image (her face centered around 65-75% down from the top, offset slightly right of center). She is captured mid-speech at a podium of black glass, one hand raised in an eloquent gesture, the other resting on an open contract book that bleeds crimson light. Her body is draped in flowing blood-red robes with silver trim, her presence magnetic and terrifying. Her face wears an expression of passionate conviction — the look of someone who genuinely believes enslavement is salvation.

Her face radiates dangerous beauty and absolute conviction — the look of a fanatic who has perfected sincerity. Her porcelain skin seems to glow with inner fire, catching crimson contract-light and silver rune-glow in equal measure. Her snow-white hair is pulled back severely, emphasizing the sharp architecture of her face, with a thin white streak of moustache-like facial jewelry curving elegantly above her lip — disturbing and deliberate. Her face is captured with hyper-real detail — passionate eyes, lips parted in mid-speech, every feature arranged to persuade.

Her eyes are extraordinary — large, deep crimson irises that seem to pulse with the blood of signed contracts, darker veins radiating outward like cracks in dried blood. Natural catchlights — two sharp, luminous reflections — sit in the upper portion of each iris, giving her eyes a feverish, mesmerizing gleam. Her lashes are white and full, her eyebrows sharp and expressive, raised in evangelical fervor. Her lips are blood-red, naturally or otherwise, moving with words that bind souls.

She is terrifyingly beautiful in a way that makes you want to believe her — beauty as a weapon of conversion. Her skin is bathed in warm crimson light from her contract book below, creating dramatic highlights that make her seem to burn from within, while cold silver ambient light rims her silhouette. Every micro-detail is rendered — the silver runes embroidered on her robes, the way shadows pool in her high collar, the contract book's pages turning themselves.

Her podium is an altar of black glass, veined with crimson. Her contract book is bound in something that was once alive. Her robes are priestly and profane — religion corrupted into control.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT: The woman's face must be positioned entirely BELOW the subtitle text area and ABOVE the author name. Her face occupies roughly the 55%-82% vertical zone of the image. The top 45% of the image (where the title and subtitle text will be placed) must contain ONLY the background elements and open space — absolutely NO part of her face, hair, or hands may enter the top 35% of the image.

BACKGROUND — THE CONGREGATION OF CHAINS: Behind her and slightly out of focus, the background depicts a vast cathedral of black stone filled with converts. Rows of once-free people sit with blank, content expressions — their names already signed away. Chains of crimson light connect each person to the contract altar. Stained glass windows depict the Dominion's "gifts" to conquered peoples. The scene shows faith perverted — willing surrender painted as enlightenment.

TEXT — MUST BE RENDERED EXACTLY AS SPECIFIED WITH UNIFORM PLACEMENT. DO NOT ALTER IN ANY WAY:
