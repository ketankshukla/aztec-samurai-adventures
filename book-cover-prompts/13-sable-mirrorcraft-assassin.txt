A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover rendered in ultra-high-resolution photorealistic style with cinematic color grading. SUBJECT — LETHAL SILENCE PORTRAIT (FEMALE MIRRORCRAFT ASSASSIN): A hauntingly beautiful woman of pale European descent, age impossible to determine, positioned in the lower-right quadrant of the image (her face centered around 65-75% down from the top, offset slightly right of center). She is captured emerging from a shattered mirror — half her body still reflection, half stepping into reality, one hand reaching forward with fingers curved like claws. Her body moves with absolute economy, every line suggesting lethal efficiency. Her face is half-concealed by a mirror-mask that shows not her reflection, but the viewer's worst memory. Her visible features wear no expression at all — the most terrifying thing about her.

Her face radiates cold beauty and absolute emptiness — the look of someone who has excised emotion as inefficiency. Her porcelain skin is flawless and pale as moonlight on snow, catching mirror-light in fractured reflections. Her hair is cut razor-straight at her shoulders, pure white and perfectly still despite movement — as if even her hair knows better than to make unnecessary motion. Black lipstick makes her lips look like wounds. Her face is captured with hyper-real detail — sharp cheekbones, one visible eye that calculates without feeling, the edge of her mirror-mask cutting across her face.

Her visible eye is extraordinary — a large, pale grey iris that seems to reflect whatever it looks at, with silver striations radiating outward like cracks in a frozen mirror. No warmth, no malice — just assessment. Natural catchlight — one sharp, luminous reflection — sits in the upper portion of the iris, cold and clinical. Her visible lash is dark against her pale skin, her visible eyebrow a perfect arch of professional indifference.

She is terrifyingly beautiful in a way that suggests beauty is irrelevant to her — a tool, not an identity. Her skin is bathed in fractured mirror-light — multiple reflections creating an impossible interplay of silver, black, and cold blue. Every micro-detail is rendered — the way mirror shards float around her, the razor edge of her hair, the mirror-mask showing something terrible that exists only in the viewer's mind, her form half-solid and half-reflection.

Her mirror-mask is her most distinctive feature — it shows whoever looks at it their worst memory, their deepest shame. Her clothes are simple black, designed for silence. She carries no visible weapons because she is the weapon.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT: The woman's face must be positioned entirely BELOW the subtitle text area and ABOVE the author name. Her face occupies roughly the 55%-82% vertical zone of the image. The top 45% of the image (where the title and subtitle text will be placed) must contain ONLY the background elements and open space — absolutely NO part of her face, hair, or mask may enter the top 35% of the image.

BACKGROUND — THE WORLD OF REFLECTIONS: Behind her and slightly out of focus, the background depicts infinite fractured mirrors stretching into impossible space. Each reflection shows a different scene — assassinations completed, targets eliminated, memories harvested. Some mirrors show the heroes in vulnerable moments. Some show deaths that haven't happened yet. Silver light fractures through the mirror-realm. The scene shows murder made architecture — death given infinite paths.

TEXT — MUST BE RENDERED EXACTLY AS SPECIFIED WITH UNIFORM PLACEMENT. DO NOT ALTER IN ANY WAY:

OVERALL MOOD: Cinematic, silent, lethally cold — fractured silver mirror-light against infinite black depths. The feeling of watching death step out of your own reflection — the moment when nowhere is safe. Photorealistic, psychological horror quality, suitable for a bestselling YA epic fantasy book cover.
