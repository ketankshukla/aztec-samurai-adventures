A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover rendered in ultra-high-resolution photorealistic style with cinematic color grading. SUBJECT — BESTIAL POWER PORTRAIT (MALE BEAST COMMANDER): A massively powerful man of pale European descent, late 40s with the vitality of a predator in his prime, positioned in the lower-right quadrant of the image (his face centered around 65-75% down from the top, offset slightly right of center). He is captured mid-battle-roar, commanding his demon-hound pack with a gesture of his fur-gauntleted hand, his other hand gripping a brutal war-axe. His body is a fortress of muscle wrapped in fur-lined armor, wolf-skull clasp gleaming at his throat. His face is twisted in feral joy — the expression of a hunter who lives for the kill.

His face radiates brutal beauty and animal magnetism — the look of a man who has become more beast than noble. His weathered pale skin is scarred and wind-burned, catching ember-light from demon-hound eyes and the fires of battle. His long white mane flows wild and untamed, unlike the groomed locks of other Dominion lords. His thick moustache is equally wild, white and bristling, giving him the look of the wolf he commands. His face is captured with hyper-real detail — a strong jaw, predator's grin showing teeth, eyes that track movement with inhuman precision.

His eyes are extraordinary — large, pale amber irises with vertical pupils like a wolf's, ringed with gold that seems to glow in low light. Natural catchlights — two sharp, luminous reflections — sit in the upper portion of each iris, giving his eyes a feral, hunting gleam. His lashes are white and coarse, his eyebrows heavy and drawn together in predatory focus. His grin is genuine — this is a man who loves what he does.

He is terrifyingly handsome in a primal, animalistic way — beauty that promises violence. His skin is bathed in warm ember-light from demon-hound eyes and distant fires, creating dramatic highlights on his scarred face, while cool moonlight rims his wild mane. Every micro-detail is rendered — the wolf-skull clasp at his throat (real, not decorative), the fur-lined pauldrons, the way his demon-hounds cluster around him like worshippers.

His armor is practical brutality — heavy plates over leather, fur lining for campaigns in any weather. His war-axe has ended champions. His demon-hounds are visible around him — massive beasts with ember eyes and shadow-fur.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT: The man's face must be positioned entirely BELOW the subtitle text area and ABOVE the author name. His face occupies roughly the 55%-82% vertical zone of the image. The top 45% of the image (where the title and subtitle text will be placed) must contain ONLY the background elements and open space — absolutely NO part of his face, hair, or weapons may enter the top 35% of the image.

BACKGROUND — THE HUNT UNLEASHED: Behind him and slightly out of focus, the background depicts a night hunt across burning villages. Demon-hounds streak through darkness, trailing ember-light. Fleeing figures are silhouetted against flames. His wolf-riders — cavalry mounted on massive demon-wolves — thunder through the scene. The moon is blood-red. The scene shows war as hunting — civilians as prey.
