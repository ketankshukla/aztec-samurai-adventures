A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover rendered in ultra-high-resolution photorealistic style with cinematic color grading. SUBJECT — SERENE HORROR PORTRAIT (MALE FALLEN SAINT): A hauntingly beautiful man of ambiguous ethnicity, appearing eternally youthful with ancient eyes, positioned in the lower-right quadrant of the image (his face centered around 65-75% down from the top, offset slightly right of center). He is captured in a gesture of blessing — hands raised gently, palms open, a soft golden glow emanating from a scar-mark on his forehead shaped like a corrupted sun. His body is robed in white and gold, priestly and pure. His face wears an expression of genuine compassion — and that is the most terrifying thing about him.

His face radiates transcendent beauty and absolute peace — the look of someone who truly believes cruelty is kindness. His luminous skin seems to glow from within, catching soft golden light that makes him appear divine. His white hair is pulled back in a perfect knot, not a strand out of place. His moustache is thin like ink strokes, elegant and precise. His face is captured with hyper-real detail — serene features, eyes that radiate love (or something wearing love's mask), lips curved in a gentle smile that promises salvation through surrender.

His eyes are extraordinary — large, pale gold irises that seem to emit light rather than reflect it, with white striations radiating outward like sun rays. Natural catchlights — two sharp, luminous reflections — sit in the upper portion of each iris, giving his eyes an almost holy gleam. But look too long and the light becomes blinding, erasing thought. His lashes are white and soft, his eyebrows gentle arches of concern. His smile is the smile of a saint — or something that consumed one.

He is terrifyingly beautiful in a way that makes you want to believe — beauty as spiritual camouflage. His skin is bathed in warm golden light emanating from his own being, creating a soft halo effect, while the faintest shadows suggest something darker beneath. Every micro-detail is rendered — the glowing scar-mark on his forehead, the pristine white robes, the way people behind him wear expressions of grateful surrender.

His robes are immaculate white with subtle gold embroidery — symbols of a twisted faith. His scar-mark pulses with soft gold light. His hands are raised in blessing — or command.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT: The man's face must be positioned entirely BELOW the subtitle text area and ABOVE the author name. His face occupies roughly the 55%-82% vertical zone of the image. The top 45% of the image (where the title and subtitle text will be placed) must contain ONLY the background elements and open space — absolutely NO part of his face, hair, or hands may enter the top 35% of the image.

BACKGROUND — THE TEMPLE OF FALSE LIGHT: Behind him and slightly out of focus, the background depicts a temple of blinding gold where converts kneel in blissful surrender. Golden light pours from every surface. People smile as they are chained — grateful for the gift of servitude. Monks in white robes tend to the "saved." Through windows, a conquered city burns peacefully — its people too blessed to scream. The scene shows salvation as annihilation — love as erasure.
