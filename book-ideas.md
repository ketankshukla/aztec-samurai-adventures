# 🗡️ AZTEC SAMURAI ADVENTURES — MASTER PLAN & IDEAS

---

## 🎯 SERIES VISION

**20 books. 24 chapters each. 480 chapters total.**
**~1,500 words per chapter (STRICT — never fall short). ~36,000 words per book. ~720,000 words total.**

A massive YA epic fantasy saga where an Aztec-descended warrior-leader trained in a samurai code forges an alliance of spear, steel, and sun-magic against pale-haired warlords, sorcerers, and demons who seek to conquer, enslave, and erase.

**Series Tagline:**
_A twenty-book saga of obsidian blades, demon gates, and the warriors who refuse to kneel._

## 📐 THE 4Cs — OUR GUIDING PRINCIPLES

These four principles govern **every decision** in this series:

### 🔵 1. CONTINUITY

- **Every event, character arc, and power level must track across all 20 books**
- A wound in Book 3 is still a scar in Book 12
- A promise in Book 1 must be fulfilled or broken by Book 20
- No retcons, no contradictions, no "forgetting" what happened
- **We need a Series Bible document that tracks all of this**

### 🟢 2. CLARITY

- **Every chapter must be instantly understandable by a teenager reading at pace**
- No convoluted sentences, no walls of exposition
- Action first, explanation woven in
- If a reader picks up Book 8, the "Where We Have Been" section gets them up to speed
- **~1,500 words per chapter keeps things punchy and clear while giving enough room for immersion**

### 🟡 3. CONSISTENCY

- **Tone, voice, power rules, and character behavior must feel the same across all 20 books**
- Sun-Blade Arts always work the same way
- Dominion sorcery always follows the same rules
- Character speech patterns stay recognizable
- **We need a Magic System Rules document and Character Voice Guide**

### 🔴 4. COHERENCY

- **The overall 20-book arc must feel like ONE story told in 20 parts**
- Each book is a complete adventure with a beginning, middle, and end
- But each book is also a chapter in the larger war
- The stakes escalate logically from local (Book 1) to cosmic (Book 20)
- **We need a Master Arc Outline that maps the full journey**

---

## 📚 EXPANDING FROM 7 BOOKS TO 20 BOOKS

### 🤔 THE CHALLENGE

The original Series Bible suggests **7 books** with a classic epic arc. We need to expand this to **20 books** without:

- Padding or filler
- Losing momentum
- Making the middle books feel like "nothing happens"
- Breaking the escalation curve

### 💡 MY SUGGESTED APPROACH — THE THREE-ACT STRUCTURE ACROSS 20 BOOKS

Instead of just stretching 7 books into 20, I suggest we think of the 20 books as **three major acts** with clear escalation:

---

### 🏛️ ACT I — THE RISING (Books 1–7)

**Theme: Discovery, Alliance, First Victories**
_The heroes discover the threat, unite, learn their powers, and win their first major battles — but at great cost._

| Book | Title                  | Focus Character     | Core Conflict                                                             |
| ---- | ---------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | **Sunblade Rising**    | Xochitl (Commander) | Village raid, stolen relic, first demon gate, reluctant alliance          |
| 2    | **The Mirror Siege**   | Coil (Scout)        | Dominion attacks through mirrors, spy infiltration, first major loss      |
| 3    | **Ash Oaths**          | Xipilli (Diplomat)  | Contract magic enslaves families, undercover in Dominion court            |
| 4    | **Hawk and Jaguar**    | Jaguar (Duelist)    | Internal rivalry threatens alliance, demon-hound devastation              |
| 5    | **The Relic Storm**    | Acatl (Engineer)    | Sacred sites weaponized, artifact quest, underwater temple                |
| 6    | **Gates of Night**     | Miyako (Sensei)     | Multiple gates open, reality thins, mentor sacrifice, true Sun-Blade form |
| 7    | **The Starless Crown** | Nenetl (Healer)     | First confrontation with VASTRIX, liberation uprising, pyrrhic victory    |

**Act I ends with:** A major victory that costs them dearly — they defeat the Dominion's first wave but VASTRIX reveals himself as something far beyond what they imagined. The war is not over. It has barely begun.

---

### ⚔️ ACT II — THE BREAKING (Books 8–14)

**Theme: Escalation, Loss, Fracture, Transformation**
_The Dominion strikes back harder. Heroes are separated, tested individually, broken and reforged. New allies and enemies emerge. The war goes global._

| Book | Title (Suggested)        | Focus Character        | Core Conflict                                                                              |
| ---- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 8    | **The Serpent's Gambit** | Coil (Scout)           | Coil goes deep undercover alone inside the Dominion, identity crisis                       |
| 9    | **Rain of Obsidian**     | Rain-Dancer (Mystic)   | Water sources corrupted by demon magic, Rain-Dancer must awaken ancient water spirits      |
| 10   | **The Burning Codex**    | Acatl (Engineer)       | Ancient blueprints for a super-weapon discovered — build it or destroy it?                 |
| 11   | **Feathers and Bone**    | Sky-Eagle (Hawk Rider) | Aerial war escalates, Sky-Eagle captured, escape from a sky-prison                         |
| 12   | **The Wolf's Teeth**     | Jaguar (Duelist)       | Vezaro launches a continental hunt, Jaguar must become the predator                        |
| 13   | **Names Written in Ash** | Xipilli (Diplomat)     | The Choir of Ash erases memories of the alliance — Xipilli must rebuild trust from nothing |
| 14   | **The Shattered Blade**  | Xochitl (Commander)    | Xochitl's katana breaks. Sun-Forge must reforge it. Xochitl faces her deepest doubt.       |

**Act II ends with:** The heroes are scattered, some captured, some changed. Xochitl's blade is reforged but she is not the same person. The Dominion controls 70% of the known world. VASTRIX opens the Great Gate. Everything seems lost.

---

### 👑 ACT III — THE RECKONING (Books 15–20)

**Theme: Reunion, Final War, Sacrifice, Legacy**
_The heroes reunite, forge impossible alliances, confront every villain, and face VASTRIX in a war that will determine the fate of all worlds._

| Book | Title (Suggested)           | Focus Character     | Core Conflict                                                                       |
| ---- | --------------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 15   | **The Forge of Souls**      | Sun-Forge (Armorer) | Sun-Forge builds the ultimate weapons for the final war, tempted by forbidden power |
| 16   | **The Mirror Queen**        | Nenetl (Healer)     | Nenetl confronts Duchess Sable in the mirror-realm, healing vs. memory-killing      |
| 17   | **The Last Contract**       | Xipilli (Diplomat)  | Breaking the Dominion's contract magic system from within, courtroom of the gods    |
| 18   | **The Choir's Silence**     | Miyako (Sensei)     | Miyako vs. the Choir of Ash and Brother Helios — discipline vs. corruption          |
| 19   | **Crown of Stars**          | Xochitl (Commander) | The allied army storms the Dominion capital, every villain confronted               |
| 20   | **The Sun That Never Sets** | ALL CHARACTERS      | Final battle with VASTRIX, the Great Gate, choosing the future of all worlds        |

**Act III ends with:** VASTRIX defeated (or transcended), the Great Gate sealed (or transformed), the Dominion broken, and the heroes choosing what kind of world to build. Not a fairy-tale ending — a earned, bittersweet, powerful conclusion.

---

## 🔄 CONSTANT THREADS ACROSS ALL 20 BOOKS

As you specified, these elements remain **constant throughout every book**:

### 🌟 Xochitl (Protagonist Leader) — Present in EVERY book

- Even when she's not the focus character, she drives the overall war strategy
- Her arc: "I must be perfect" → "I must be true" (spans all 20 books)
- She grows from reluctant commander to legendary war-leader to wise peace-builder

### 💀 Lord Albérico (Antagonist Leader) — Present in EVERY book

- Even when other villains take center stage, Albérico is the political mastermind
- His arc: Theatrical conqueror → desperate tyrant → tragic figure who chose power over humanity
- He and Xochitl are mirrors of each other — both leaders, both burdened, opposite choices

### 🔥 The Escalating War

- Books 1–7: Local/regional conflict
- Books 8–14: Continental/global conflict
- Books 15–20: Cosmic/multidimensional conflict

## 🎨 COVER PROMPTS — NEED TO REDO

### ⚠️ WHY WE NEED TO REDO THE 20 PROMPTS

The 20 character prompts we already created were done **before** we decided on the 20-book structure. Now that each book has a specific focus character and a specific story, the cover prompts need to:

1. **Match the specific book they belong to** (correct book number, correct title)
2. **Depict a scene or moment from THAT book's story** (not generic character poses)
3. **Show the character's arc at the point they're at in THAT book** (not a static portrait)
4. **Include background elements specific to THAT book's conflict**
5. **Maintain the 4Cs** — every cover must feel like part of the same series

### 📝 PROPOSED APPROACH

- Keep the existing 20 prompts as **character reference prompts** (rename folder to `character-reference-prompts`)
- Create NEW prompts in each book's `image-prompts/` folder that are **story-specific**
- Each book gets **5 variant cover prompts** (different angles/moments from that book)

---

## ✍️ CHAPTER CLIFFHANGERS — THE PAGE-TURNER ENGINE

### 📌 WITHIN EACH BOOK (Chapter-to-Chapter)

Every chapter ending must make the reader **physically unable to stop reading**. Types of cliffhangers to rotate:

- 🔪 **Danger cliffhanger** — character in immediate peril
- 😱 **Revelation cliffhanger** — shocking information revealed
- 💔 **Emotional cliffhanger** — relationship rupture or sacrifice
- ❓ **Mystery cliffhanger** — something unexplained happens
- ⚔️ **Action cliffhanger** — mid-battle cut to another POV
- 🚪 **Arrival cliffhanger** — someone or something unexpected appears

### 📌 BETWEEN BOOKS (Book-to-Book)

Every book ending must make the reader **immediately want to buy the next book**:

- Book ends with a major victory BUT a bigger threat revealed
- Book ends with a character captured, missing, or transformed
- Book ends with a game-changing revelation about the world, the war, or a character's identity
- **The last line of every book should be a gut-punch**

---

## 🗣️ TONE & LANGUAGE — YA PAGE-TURNER VOICE

### ✅ DO

- Short, punchy sentences in action scenes
- Vivid sensory details (what they see, hear, smell, feel)
- Emotional honesty — teens feel things intensely, so should these characters
- Humor between the heroes (banter, nicknames, teasing)
- Villains who are genuinely scary AND fascinating
- Stakes that feel personal, not just political

### ❌ DON'T

- No long exposition dumps
- No overly complex political scheming without action
- No "telling" emotions — always "showing"
- No talking down to the reader
- No sanitizing violence — this is war, but keep it YA-appropriate (consequences, not gore)

### 💬 SAMPLE VOICE TARGETS

- **Xochitl:** Calm, decisive, uses "we" — _"We don't retreat. We reposition."_
- **Coil:** Playful, slangy, daring — _"So the plan is 'don't die,' yeah?"_
- **Jaguar:** Bold, teasing, proud — _"Stand behind me, cubs. I'll show you how it's done."_
- **Albérico:** Grand, theatrical, cruel — _"You call this resistance? I call it entertainment."_

## 💡 SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT

### 1. 🗺️ CREATE A "WORLD MAP" DOCUMENT

A markdown document describing the geography, cities, temples, and territories. This helps maintain the 4Cs when characters travel between locations across 20 books.

### 2. 📅 CREATE A TIMELINE DOCUMENT

A chronological timeline of events across all 20 books. This prevents continuity errors and helps track how much time passes in the story.

### 3. 🧬 CREATE A "POWER PROGRESSION" CHART

Track how each hero's abilities grow across the series. Prevents power creep and ensures growth feels earned, not random.

### 4. 🤝 CREATE A "RELATIONSHIP WEB" DOCUMENT

Track all character relationships and how they evolve. The PDF already suggests some (Xochitl & Jaguar, Coil & Xipilli, etc.) — we expand this across 20 books.

### 5. 📝 CREATE A "PREVIOUSLY ON..." SECTION FOR EACH BOOK

Like the reference project's "Where We Have Been" — but written as a dramatic recap, like a TV show "Previously on..." segment. Teens will love this.

### 6. 🎭 GIVE EACH VILLAIN THEIR OWN "DEFEAT ARC"

Instead of defeating all villains in the final book, spread villain defeats across the series:

- Some villains are defeated early but return transformed
- Some villains switch sides
- Some villains die heroically defending something they care about
- VASTRIX is the only villain who lasts until Book 20

### 7. 🌟 ADD "INTERLUDE" CHAPTERS

Between some books, add short villain-POV interludes that show what the Dominion is planning. This builds dread and makes villains feel three-dimensional.

### 8. 📱 CONSIDER A "CHARACTER CARDS" SYSTEM

Create a markdown file with "trading card" style character profiles that could be turned into actual collectible cards or social media content. Teens love collectible character content.

---

## ✅ DECISIONS MADE (Resolved Questions)

These questions have been discussed and resolved. Decisions are **final**.

### 1. 📏 CHAPTER LENGTH — 1,500 WORDS (STRICT)

**Decision:** Every chapter will be exactly ~1,500 words. No falling short. This gives us ~36,000 words per book (~120-150 pages), which is solid YA territory.

### 2. 🎭 VILLAIN POV CHAPTERS — YES

**Decision:** Include chapters from the villains' perspective. This makes them scarier, more three-dimensional, and builds tension. Readers will love seeing the Dominion's plans unfold from the inside.

### 3. ⚔️ HERO-VILLAIN COVER PAIRING — YES, IN COMBAT

**Decision:** Some covers will feature hero-villain pairs, but they must be **actively fighting each other** — not just standing side by side. Requirements:

- **Different facial expressions and striking poses** for each variant
- **Wizards/warlocks** use lightning bolts, dark energy, contract-fire, mirror-shards, and other creative magic effects — NOT swords
- **Samurai warriors** primarily use swords but also other weapons (spears, bows, bucklers, glyph-thread whips, etc.)
- **Every variation** must have distinct poses and expressions — no two covers should feel the same

### 4. 🆕 NEW CHARACTERS — PHASED IN ACROSS LATER BOOKS

**Decision:** Don't introduce all characters at once. Phase new heroes and villains into Acts II and III to keep things fresh. Every character on a cover must look **completely distinct**:

- **Unique facial features** — no two characters should look similar
- **Unique appearance** — different body types, skin tones, hair, armor styles, accessories
- **Unique weapons** — each character's weapon is as memorable as they are
- **Memorable and unforgettable** — a reader should recognize any character instantly from silhouette alone

### 5. 💕 ROMANCE — YES, WITH PRONOUNCEABLE NAMES

**Decision:** Include romance subplots. **All character names must be renamed** to be:

- **Easy to pronounce** and remember
- **Aztec-samurai fusion** names that sound awesome and cool (not simple like John/Mary)
- **Villain names** should sound powerful and menacing (like "Dalenthar," "Voltar")
- **Hero names** should sound strong, cool, and inspiring
- **The name must evoke the character's image** — there is power in a name
- Names must be **uniquely memorable** alongside their visual design

### 6. 💀 CHARACTER DEATHS — STRATEGIC (See detailed section below)

**Decision:** Characters will die, but strategically. See the full **Character Death Strategy** section below.

### 7. 🖼️ COVER PROMPTS — TWO TYPES (See detailed section below)

**Decision:** We maintain two types of prompts. See the full **Cover Prompt Types Explained** section below.

---

## 👴 ELDERLY CHARACTERS — WISDOM ON BOTH SIDES

### ⚠️ THIS IS A NEW REQUIREMENT

Both sides of the war need **elderly mentor/advisor characters** who provide deep wisdom and strategic counsel. Their language and advice must **clearly express their side's intentions and philosophy**.

### 🌅 PROTAGONIST ELDERS — Constructive Wisdom

Elderly characters on the hero side give **solid constructive advice for winning the battle**. Their wisdom is about:

- **Protecting life** while fighting effectively
- **Unity, discipline, and sacrifice** for the greater good
- **Ancient knowledge** of Sun-Blade Arts passed down through generations
- **Strategic patience** — knowing when NOT to fight is as important as knowing how
- **Moral clarity** — winning means nothing if you become what you're fighting against

**Language style:** Warm but firm. Proverbs that hit like hammers. Short sentences that carry the weight of centuries. They speak with the authority of experience, not rank.

**Sample elder voice:**

- _"The blade that protects is sharper than the blade that conquers, child. Remember that when the darkness comes."_
- _"You ask me how to win? First, decide what you are willing to lose. Then make sure it is not your soul."_
- _"I have seen empires fall. They all fell the same way — they forgot what they were fighting for."_

### 🌑 ANTAGONIST ELDERS — Destructive Wisdom

Elderly characters on the villain side give **solid destructive advice for winning the battle**. Their wisdom is about:

- **Exploiting weakness** — every compassion is a vulnerability
- **Control through fear, contracts, and dependency**
- **Ancient knowledge** of Dominion sorcery and demon-binding
- **Strategic cruelty** — breaking the enemy's will is more efficient than breaking their army
- **Absolute conviction** — mercy is weakness, hesitation is death, power is the only truth

**Language style:** Cold, elegant, and terrifyingly logical. Their advice sounds reasonable, which makes it more dangerous. They speak with the authority of conquest.

**Sample elder voice:**

- _"You wish to defeat them? Do not kill their warriors. Kill their hope. The warriors will follow."_
- _"Compassion is a leash they put on themselves. Pull it, and they will choke on their own kindness."_
- _"I have built empires. They all rose the same way — someone decided that mercy was a luxury they could no longer afford."_

### 📋 ELDER CHARACTERS TO CREATE

We need to design **at least 2 elders per side** (4 total minimum):

**Hero Elders:**

- A retired Sun-Blade grandmaster (ancient warrior who can still fight but chooses to teach)
- A temple keeper / lore-master (keeper of sacred knowledge, non-combatant but invaluable)

**Villain Elders:**

- A Dominion high sorcerer emeritus (the one who taught the current villains their craft)
- A demon-bound oracle (ancient being who sees futures and advises the Dominion throne)

These elders will be **named with the same pronounceable naming conventions** as all other characters.

---

## 🏷️ CHARACTER RENAMING — PRONOUNCEABLE & MEMORABLE NAMES

### ⚠️ THIS IS A NEW REQUIREMENT

All character names from the original Series Bible need to be **renamed** to be:

- Easy to pronounce for English-speaking teens
- Memorable and evocative of the character's personality/role
- Aztec-samurai fusion for heroes (exotic but not tongue-twisting)
- Powerful and menacing for villains (names that sound like they could destroy a city)

### 💡 NAMING PHILOSOPHY

**There is power in a name.** The reader should perceive the character's image from the name alone:

- A hero named **"Kael"** sounds fast and sharp — perfect for a scout
- A villain named **"Voltar"** sounds like thunder and conquest — perfect for a warlord
- A healer named **"Lumi"** sounds gentle and luminous — perfect for a battle-medic
- A demon named **"VASTRIX"** already sounds cosmic and final — this one stays

### 📋 RENAMING WILL HAPPEN IN PHASE 1

We will create a full **Character Name Registry** document that maps:

- Old name → New name
- Pronunciation guide
- Name meaning/origin
- Why this name fits the character

This ensures the 4Cs — every name is consistent, clear, and coherent across all 20 books.

---

## 💀 CHARACTER DEATH STRATEGY — THE SLOW BURN

### ⚠️ THE CORE PRINCIPLE

**No beloved character dies quickly.** Every death must be:

- **Earned** — the character has had a full, satisfying arc
- **Devastating** — the reader has had time to fall deeply in love with them
- **Meaningful** — the death changes the course of the war or transforms other characters
- **Late enough** — the reader has bought and read enough books to be fully invested

### 🎯 THE STRATEGY: GRADUATED LOSS

Here's how to handle character deaths across 20 books without losing readers:

**Books 1–7 (Act I): NO major hero deaths.**

- Minor allies and side characters can die to establish that war has consequences
- One or two **close calls** where a hero almost dies — this trains the reader to fear for them
- Villain defeats (not deaths) begin — some villains are captured, banished, or humiliated
- **Reader investment is being built.** Don't cash it in yet.

**Books 8–14 (Act II): ONE hero death, maximum TWO.**

- The first hero death should happen around **Book 10–12** — deep enough that the reader is devastated
- Choose a hero who has completed a meaningful arc and whose death transforms the survivors
- **Best candidates for Act II death:** Characters whose arc is about sacrifice (the healer, the sensei, or the armorer — someone whose death feels like they CHOSE it to save others)
- This death should be **the most emotional moment in the entire series so far**
- A second death could happen at the end of Act II (Book 14) as part of the "everything is lost" moment

**Books 15–20 (Act III): ONE to TWO more hero deaths.**

- These deaths happen in the final war and feel like the ultimate price of victory
- **Best candidates for Act III death:** Characters whose arc is about legacy — they die knowing the world they fought for will survive
- The FINAL book (Book 20) can have a death, but it should NOT be the protagonist (Xochitl survives — she must carry the weight of everyone she lost)
- **Total hero deaths across 20 books: 2–4 maximum**

### 🛡️ CHARACTERS WHO SHOULD NEVER DIE

- **Xochitl** — she is the heart of the series. She survives but carries the scars.
- **The romantic interest** — killing a love interest feels punishing, not meaningful
- **The comic relief character** — their death would feel like the series lost its soul

### ⚰️ CHARACTERS WHO COULD DIE (candidates, not confirmed)

- **The Sensei (Miyako)** — classic mentor sacrifice, deeply emotional, transforms the students into masters
- **The Armorer (Sun-Forge)** — dies forging the ultimate weapon, his life's work complete
- **The Healer (Nenetl)** — dies saving someone who "shouldn't" have been saved, proving compassion is strength
- **The Scout (Coil)** — dies on a mission, alone, the way he always feared — but this time, by choice

### 💡 THE GOLDEN RULE

**A character death should make the reader cry, then immediately want to keep reading to see how the survivors honor that sacrifice.** If a death makes the reader close the book and not come back — it was the wrong death at the wrong time.

## 🖼️ COVER PROMPT TYPES — EXPLAINED IN DETAIL

### ⚠️ TWO DISTINCT TYPES OF PROMPTS

There are **two different kinds** of image prompts we use, and they serve different purposes:

### 📸 TYPE 1: CHARACTER REFERENCE PROMPTS (What we already have)

**Purpose:** These are **standalone character portraits** that establish what each character looks like. They are NOT tied to any specific book or story moment.

**What they contain:**

- The character in a signature pose that captures their personality
- Their full appearance: face, hair, armor, weapons, accessories
- A generic background that fits their vibe (battlefield, moonlit shore, forge, etc.)
- Generic book title/series text (placeholder — not matched to a specific book)

**What they're used for:**

- **Visual reference** — "This is what Xochitl looks like" for consistency across all future prompts
- **Character cards / social media** — standalone character art for marketing
- **Artist reference** — if you ever commission an artist, these are the briefs

**Where they live:** `book-cover-prompts/` folder (will be renamed to `character-reference-prompts/`)

**We already created 20 of these.** They stay as-is (with updated names once we rename characters).

---

### 📖 TYPE 2: STORY-SPECIFIC COVER PROMPTS (What we need to create)

**Purpose:** These are **book cover images** tied to a specific book's story. They depict a key moment, conflict, or scene from THAT book.

**What they contain:**

- The focus character in a pose/action specific to THAT book's plot
- Their appearance reflecting where they are in their arc (e.g., scarred in Book 12, not Book 1)
- A background depicting a scene from THAT book's story (not generic)
- The correct book number, title, and subtitle for THAT specific book
- For hero-villain pairing covers: both characters in active combat with distinct weapons and magic

**What they're used for:**

- **The actual book cover** — this is what goes on the published book
- **Retail listings** — Amazon, bookstores, etc.
- **Series branding** — every cover must feel like part of the same series while being unique

**Where they live:** Inside each book's `image-prompts/` folder (e.g., `book-series/Aztec Samurai Adventures Book 01 - Sunblade Rising/image-prompts/`)

**Each book gets 5 variant prompts** — same character and book, but different angles, moments, poses, and expressions. This gives options for the best cover.

### 🔑 KEY DIFFERENCE SUMMARIZED

| Aspect                   | Character Reference Prompt   | Story-Specific Cover Prompt      |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Tied to a book?**      | No — standalone              | Yes — specific book              |
| **Shows story moment?**  | No — generic pose            | Yes — key scene from that book   |
| **Character arc stage?** | Default/introduction         | Where they are in THAT book      |
| **Background?**          | Generic atmosphere           | Specific to that book's conflict |
| **Book title on cover?** | Placeholder/generic          | Exact correct title and number   |
| **How many?**            | 1 per character (20 total)   | 5 per book (100 total)           |
| **Purpose?**             | Visual reference & marketing | Actual published book cover      |
