A breathtaking ultra-high-resolution photorealistic landscape box set cover rendered at 2400x1600 pixels, 300 DPI, in sharp cinematic digital style with advanced volumetric lighting, ray-traced reflections, and subsurface skin scattering. ABSOLUTELY NO oil painting, NO watercolor, NO painterly brushstrokes. Every pixel razor-sharp, hyper-detailed, cinematically lit.

CONCEPT — WIDE PANORAMIC COMPOSITION:

The landscape format transforms the portrait composition into a sweeping cinematic panorama — the four Act I heroes spread across the full width of the frame, standing on the broad top step of the Sun-Blade temple, their figures silhouetted and lit against a vast sky that tells the visual story of the entire first act from left to right.

The composition is divided into four visual columns, each blending seamlessly into the next, each representing one book:

FAR LEFT (Book 1 — Sunblade Rising): Golden dawn light pours through massive Mesoamerican temple columns. Itzil stands in this column — full figure, dynamic three-quarter pose, Sun-Blade held at her side blazing with golden fire. Her warrior braids, quetzal-feather crest, and jade-obsidian armor are rendered with the same breathtaking detail as her individual cover. Her face is lit by warm golden light — fierce, beautiful, determined, the uncertain commander at the start of her journey. The cracked Demon Gate archway is visible behind her, dark energy seeping from its fractures. Golden embers and turquoise particles swirl upward. The mood is HOPE — warm, golden, the beginning of everything.

CENTER-LEFT (Book 2 — The Mirror Siege): The golden light fractures into cold silver-white mirror-light. Kaelen crouches in this column — one knee down, knife in hand, pale grey-blue eyes scanning for threats. Mirror-shards float in the air around him, each reflecting a different distorted scene. Behind him, the faint glow of Aravalle under siege — distant fires and the silver flash of active mirror-portals. His dark scout armor absorbs the light; his devastating face catches it. The mood shifts from warm gold to cold silver — DANGER arriving through reflections.

CENTER-RIGHT (Book 3 — Ash Oaths): The silver mirror-light warms into rich crimson-gold ash-candle glow. Zariel stands tall in this column — the most elegant figure, his burgundy diplomatic coat catching the warm light, one hand extended in a gesture of negotiation, the other resting on a concealed blade. His golden-amber eyes are warm and calculating. Behind him, floating ash-candles and the suggestion of a grand Dominion negotiation hall — crimson banners, obsidian pillars. The mood is SEDUCTION — the warmth of politics that hides blades.

FAR RIGHT (Book 4 — The Starless Crown): The crimson warmth is consumed by encroaching void-darkness. Jagren stands defiant in this column — twin-bladed staff planted before him, his wild black curls catching the last of the firelight, his gorgeous face bloodied but grinning. Behind him, the Starless Crown descends from the upper-right corner — a crown-shaped void devouring stars, its anti-light tendrils reaching into the scene. Embers rise from battlefield fires below only to be extinguished at the Crown's boundary. The mood is REVELATION — the first glimpse that the real enemy was never the empire.

The four columns blend seamlessly — golden light fading into mirror-silver, warming to crimson, darkening to void. The sky runs continuously across the top of the frame, telling the entire Act I arc in a single horizontal sweep. The temple architecture provides visual continuity across all four columns — the same stone, the same step, connecting the heroes in shared space even as their lighting diverges.

Each hero is rendered with individual photorealistic beauty — faces sharp and striking, costumes distinct, weapons gleaming. They are spread wide enough to breathe in the landscape format, each commanding their own visual territory, yet connected by the continuous temple step and the turquoise particles that drift across all four columns.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — LANDSCAPE FORMAT:

All four heroes' heads must sit between 35-65% from the top of the frame. The top 25% is reserved for sky transitions and text. The bottom 15% is reserved for the temple step foreground and author name. No character's head may enter the top 25%.

OVERALL MOOD: Epic, hopeful, with gathering shadows — a cinematic widescreen sweep from golden dawn to encroaching void. The landscape format emphasizes the JOURNEY — the eye travels left to right across four books, four moods, four heroes, and the gradual realization that hope alone won't be enough. PHOTOREALISTIC. NO oil painting.
