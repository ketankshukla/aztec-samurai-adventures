A breathtaking ultra-high-resolution photorealistic box set cover rendered at 1600x2400 pixels, 300 DPI, in sharp cinematic digital style with advanced volumetric lighting. ABSOLUTELY NO oil painting, NO watercolor, NO painterly brushstrokes. Every pixel razor-sharp, hyper-detailed, cinematically lit.

CONCEPT: Four heroes standing together at the threshold of war — each one representing one of the four books in Act I. They stand on a broad temple step, silhouetted against a vast golden sunrise, their weapons and distinctive features visible in sharp relief. The composition reads left to right as the heroes were introduced: Itzil (center-left, Sun-Blade blazing gold), Kaelen (far left, crouched with knife, mirror-shards floating near him), Zariel (center-right, standing tall in diplomatic robes, one hand extended), Jagren (far right, twin-bladed staff over shoulder, wild curls catching the light).

Behind them, the sky tells the story of Act I — from left to right: golden dawn (Book 1's hope), fractured mirror-light (Book 2's siege), crimson ash-candle glow (Book 3's politics), and the first tendrils of the Starless Crown void creeping in from the upper-right corner (Book 4's revelation). The sky is a visual timeline of the first act — hope giving way to the first signs of something far worse than empire.

The four heroes are rendered with the same photorealistic quality as their individual covers — each face individually beautiful and recognizable, each costume and weapon distinct. Itzil's warrior braids and quetzal feathers, Kaelen's dark scout armor and pale eyes, Zariel's burgundy diplomatic coat and golden-amber eyes, Jagren's arena armor and wild hair. They stand as a unit but each faces a slightly different direction — they are not yet fully unified, still individuals learning to become a team.

The temple behind them is the Sun-Blade temple from Book 1 — massive stone columns, Mesoamerican carvings, the cracked Demon Gate archway visible in the far background with dark energy seeping from its fractures.

Golden embers and turquoise particles fill the air. Volumetric god-rays stream through the temple columns.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE: All four heroes' heads must be below the 40% line. The top 40% is reserved for text and sky.
