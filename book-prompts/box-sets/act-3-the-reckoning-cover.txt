---

A breathtaking ultra-high-resolution photorealistic box set cover rendered at 1600x2400 pixels, 300 DPI, in sharp cinematic digital style. ABSOLUTELY NO oil painting, NO watercolor, NO painterly brushstrokes.

CONCEPT: The heroes reunited and ascendant — the full ensemble arranged in a V-formation charging forward through the shattered gates of the Dominion capital, led by Itzil with her reforged Sun-Blade blazing at maximum intensity. The composition is a triumphant inversion of Act II's scattered, broken imagery — where that cover fractured its heroes into isolated zones of darkness, this cover unifies them in a single unstoppable wave of golden light.

CENTER (point of the V): Itzil strides forward, Sun-Blade held at her side blazing with controlled golden fire, her new armor gleaming with the solar calendar filigree, her face showing absolute clarity and purpose. She is the spear-point.

FLANKING LEFT: Kaelen (pale eyes burning, scout armor, knife drawn), Rainara (turquoise water-energy swirling around her arms), Solkren (massive, bare-armed, hammer in hand).

FLANKING RIGHT: Jagren (twin-bladed staff spinning, fierce grin), Neyla (hands glowing turquoise with healing energy), Zariel (diplomatic robes flowing, a thin blade in his left hand).

ABOVE: Skyren on her war-hawk diving from the upper portion of the scene, javelin poised, feathered cloak streaming — the aerial element completing the assault.

Behind the heroes, the allied army surges through the breach — thousands of soldiers, dozens of banners, the combined might of every nation the heroes united across twelve books. War-hawks circle in the sky above. The Dominion capital's dark walls crumble before the golden light.

The sky tells the final story — the Starless Crown is SHATTERING, visible in the upper portion, its void-darkness cracking apart as stars burst through the fractures, reclaiming the sky. Golden dawn light floods in from the right. The transition from void to starlight to golden dawn creates a visual crescendo — darkness giving way to the most brilliant light in the entire series.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE: All faces below 40% line. Top 40% for text, shattering Crown, and returning stars.
