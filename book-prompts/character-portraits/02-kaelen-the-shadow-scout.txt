A breathtaking ultra-high-resolution photorealistic character portrait rendered at 1600x2400 pixels, 300 DPI, in sharp cinematic digital style with advanced volumetric lighting, ray-traced reflections, and subsurface skin scattering. This must look like a $200-million Hollywood movie poster — every surface, every texture, every particle of light rendered with obsessive photographic precision.

Every pixel must be razor-sharp, hyper-detailed, and cinematically lit.

SUBJECT — LETHAL STILLNESS PORTRAIT (THE SHADOW SCOUT):

A devastatingly handsome young man of mixed heritage — sun-darkened olive skin suggesting desert and jungle lineage — in his mid-20s. Kaelen, the greatest scout alive, positioned in the lower-center of the image, face centered at approximately 60-75% down from the top. He is captured in a moment of lethal stillness — crouched at the edge of shadow, one hand braced against a fractured stone wall, the other gripping a long curved hunting knife reversed along his forearm. Half-emerged from darkness, one side of his face illuminated by cool silver-blue light while the other remains in shadow — a man who lives between seen and unseen.

FACE — HYPER-DETAILED PHOTOREALISTIC BEAUTY:

Strikingly handsome in a sharp, angular way — the face of a predator, not a prince. High cheekbones with dramatic hollows beneath, creating shadows that emphasize architectural precision. Strong, clean jawline sharpened by perpetual lean hardness. Sun-darkened olive-bronze skin weathered by life outdoors — photorealistic pore detail across nose and cheeks, faintest sun-creasing at outer eye corners. A thin white scar runs diagonally through his left eyebrow, breaking the brow line with asymmetric intensity.

His eyes are his most devastating feature — large, deep-set, startlingly pale against dark skin. Clear, piercing grey-blue with darker slate rings at iris edges and tiny silver flecks like crushed mica. Eyes that see everything and trust nothing — watchful, intelligent, burning with controlled intensity. Two sharp catchlights give predatory alertness. Dark, thick, dense lashes frame those extraordinary pale eyes. One brow permanently broken by the scar, the intact brow slightly raised in sardonic assessment.

Straight, sharp nose with barely perceptible crook from an old break never properly set. Well-shaped lips — upper thinner and precisely drawn, lower fuller with slight natural pout softening severity. Expression perfectly controlled — a half-smile that doesn't reach his eyes. Beautiful the way a blade is beautiful — functional, precise, dangerous.

Three days of dark stubble, each hair individually visible. A thinner, newer scar along the right side of his neck. Cool silver-blue light on one side, warm amber on the other — a man caught between two realities.

HAIR — PRACTICAL AND STRIKING:

Dark, nearly black with warm brown undertones. Practical scout's length to his collar, swept from his face in a style suggesting he cuts it himself with a knife. Longer on top, falling in natural waves, tousled and windswept. Several strands across his brow. Matte texture of field life — no shine, just natural dark waves framing his sharp face like a predator's mane.

ARMOR AND EQUIPMENT — SCOUT'S PRECISION:

Fitted dark leather armor reinforced with thin obsidian scale plates at shoulders, chest, forearms — scales small and overlapping, absorbing light. Dark charcoal-grey fabric beneath, secured with leather cord ties (not metal — metal makes noise). Hard dark leather vambraces with subtle geometric tooling. Compact recurve bow in quick-draw harness across his back. Multiple knives visible — main hunting knife in hand (curved, single-edge, leather grip), throwing knife at small of back, third in left boot. Leather pouch of flash-powder charges, coiled dark rope. Everything optimized for one man operating alone behind enemy lines.

BACKGROUND — ENEMY TERRITORY AT TWILIGHT:

Behind Kaelen and slightly out of focus, a scene of hostile territory at the boundary between dusk and dark. Dominion architecture — dark stone walls, crimson banners bearing the iron crown insignia, floating ash-oath candles casting unsettling crimson-orange light. Distant war-beasts prowl with ember-red eyes. Through a gap in the walls, a sliver of clear sky shows the distant turquoise aurora of the alliance's magical defenses. The cool, dangerous world of the spy — cramped passages, shadowed alcoves, enemy territory stretching in every direction.

ATMOSPHERIC EFFECTS:

Cool silver-blue moonlight clashes with warm crimson ash-candle glow. Shadow-step energy manifests as faint dark ripples around his feet and legs — the beginning of invisibility. Fine particles of mirror-dust and ash drift through the scene. The overall effect is tense beauty — a man alone in enemy territory surrounded by destruction, holding a knife and a plan.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT:

Kaelen's face must be positioned entirely BELOW the text area and ABOVE the quote at the bottom. His face occupies roughly the 55%-82% vertical zone. The top 40% must contain ONLY background elements. NO part of his face, hair, weapon, or body may enter the top 35%.

TEXT — MUST BE RENDERED EXACTLY AS SPECIFIED:

OVERALL MOOD AND QUALITY:

Tense, dangerous, coldly beautiful — the feeling of being the only person between an army and annihilation. Dominant palette: silver-blue, midnight blue, ember-red, and shadow. Kaelen must be magnetically handsome — sharp, dangerous beauty earned through suffering. The dark mirror to Itzil's golden fire — where she blazes, he vanishes.

ABSOLUTELY NO oil painting texture. NO watercolor. NO canvas grain. NO painterly edges. PHOTOREALISTIC CINEMATIC DIGITAL ART — sharp, clean, precise, and devastatingly beautiful.
