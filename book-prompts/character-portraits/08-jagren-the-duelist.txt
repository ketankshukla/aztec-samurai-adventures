SUBJECT — DEFIANT WARRIOR PORTRAIT (THE DUELIST):

A breathtakingly handsome young man of Mesoamerican descent in his mid-20s — Jagren, the arena duelist turned vanguard commander — positioned in the lower-center of the image, face centered at approximately 60-75% down from the top. He is captured in magnificent defiance — standing tall with his twin-bladed fighting staff held diagonally across his body, the upper blade blazing with reflected firelight. His chin is raised, eyes burning with fierce determination. Blood and ash streak his face and armor — he has been fighting for hours and looks like a god of war dragged through hell who came out swinging.

FACE — HYPER-DETAILED PHOTOREALISTIC BEAUTY:

Jagren's face is the most traditionally gorgeous of the male characters — built for arena posters and adoring crowds, now tempered by war into something far more compelling. Bold, dramatic bone structure — broad, high cheekbones catching light in wide planes, a strong square jaw with a slight chin dimple, a broad noble forehead beneath wild battle-tousled hair. Deep warm brown skin — rich, luminous, darker than Itzil's bronze, with warm mahogany undertones that make him glow like polished hardwood in firelight. Battle marks — a fresh cut across his left cheekbone glistening with blood, a bruise darkening along his right jaw. Photorealistic pore detail, sheen of sweat covering every visible inch. He has been fighting for hours. He is magnificent.

His eyes are dark and blazing — deep brown so rich they appear almost black in shadow, but in firelight they reveal mahogany, burnt sienna, and flecks of copper-gold that smolder like banked embers. Wide, fierce eyes burning with defiance bordering on joy — Jagren fights because he loves it, even losing, even bleeding. Fierce catchlights blaze in each iris. Thick, dark lashes slightly clumped with sweat and ash.

Strong, expressive eyebrows — naturally thick, the left partially obscured by a streak of blood. Nose strong, slightly broad, broken at least once and healed with slight asymmetry. Full, well-shaped lips — naturally dark, almost burgundy, currently split at the corner with a thin blood line tracing down his chin. His mouth is set in fierce determination — teeth bared, white against dark skin. The most alive face in the series — pure, reckless, beautiful courage.

A streak of blood across his forehead. Ash smudged across his right cheek. A thin gold arena earring — survivor's talisman — still in his left ear, catching firelight.

HAIR — WILD AND GLORIOUS:

Thick, black, naturally curly — exploding in all directions in a glorious mane shaken loose from restraint. Coils and spirals of jet-black hair, some matted with sweat and blood, others catching firelight in glossy highlights. Thick locks fall across his forehead, partially obscuring his left eye. Hair threaded with thin gold wire — arena tradition — most tangled or broken, enough remaining to scatter golden sparks through dark curls. The hair moves with violent energy, individual coils stretching upward.

ARMOR — ARENA CHAMPION AT WAR:

Arena-influenced, battle-hardened armor — lighter than Itzil's, designed for speed and spectacle. Fitted cuirass of burnished bronze and dark leather, shaped to his muscular frame, dented and scored with fresh blade marks. Right shoulder guard missing — torn away in combat, revealing sculpted bare shoulder gleaming with sweat. Left shoulder bears an ornate gold-and-obsidian pauldron carved with a snarling jaguar — his arena sigil. Bare arms below the pauldrons — muscular, veined with exertion, dark skin criss-crossed with thin white arena scars and newer red battle cuts. Leather fighting wraps binding forearms and hands, stained with sweat and blood. His twin-bladed fighting staff — six-foot ironwood pole capped with curved obsidian blades — chipped and notched but unbroken. Like its wielder.

BACKGROUND — THE BATTLEFIELD AT DUSK:

Behind Jagren and slightly out of focus, a vast battlefield at dusk — churned mud and scorched stone, broken weapons and fallen banners. Burning siege engines like enormous torches. Allied soldiers visible in the distance — scattered, some fighting, others retreating. The golden glow of Itzil's Sun-Blade visible as a distant point of golden fire. The sky above shows the Starless Crown — the void constellation of absolute blackness, tendrils of anti-light reaching downward. Embers rise from burning wreckage, swirling upward only to be extinguished at the Crown's boundary.

ATMOSPHERIC EFFECTS:

Thousands of embers rise from burning siege engines — orange and gold, swirling upward. Fine ash drifts like grey snow. Firelight creates warm, desperate orange-gold lighting across everything. The boundary between firelight and the Starless Crown's influence creates visible distortion. Jagren's breath is visible in the unnatural cold despite surrounding fires.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT:

Jagren's face must be positioned entirely BELOW the text area and ABOVE the quote at the bottom. His face occupies roughly the 55%-82% vertical zone. The top 40% must contain ONLY background elements. NO part of his face, hair, weapon, or body may enter the top 35%.
