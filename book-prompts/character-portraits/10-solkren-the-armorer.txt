SUBJECT — MASTER CRAFTSMAN PORTRAIT (THE ARMORER):

A powerfully built man of indigenous Mesoamerican descent in his early 30s — Solkren, the Master Armorer and Soul-Forger — positioned in the lower-center of the image, face centered at approximately 60-75% down from the top. He stands before an enormous ceremonial forge, both hands gripping massive tongs that hold a blazing object in the heart of white-gold fire — the Sun-Blade being reforged. The metal is white-hot at center, transitioning through gold, amber, and cherry-red at the edges. Thousands of sparks cascade outward in brilliant arcs — each a tiny star. His face is illuminated entirely by forge-light — a man transformed by creation into something magnificent.

FACE — HYPER-DETAILED PHOTOREALISTIC BEAUTY:

Solkren's face is handsome in a way unlike any other character — broad, solid, powerful, with the gravity of a mountain. Wide cheekbones almost flat rather than high, a broad square jaw carved from stone, and a low prominent brow giving thoughtful, serious quality. Deep brown skin — darker than most characters — with warm red-clay undertones dramatically amplified by forge-light, making his skin glow like heated bronze. Fine soot and forge-dust settled into creases around his eyes, dusting cheekbones, smudging his forehead. Photorealistic sweat — large droplets running from hairline down temples and jaw, each catching forge-light like liquid gold on dark skin. Heat has flushed his face deeper across cheeks and broad nose.

His eyes are remarkable — deep dark brown, almost black, but in forge-light they reveal warm umber and dark gold like aged wood. The most patient, focused eyes in the series — eyes that can stare at metal for twelve hours and see the weapon inside. Gaze fixed on the blazing blade with unwavering concentration. Pupils contracted to pinpoints against blinding light. Thick, strong brows drawn in concentration, beaded with sweat. Short, dark lashes nearly invisible against forge glare.

Broad, strong nose — prominent, wide nostrils slightly flared from heat. Full lips firmly set — naturally dark, pressed in the determined line of a craftsman at the critical moment. Jaw set like an anvil. A thick burn scar along the right side of his neck and jawline — old, healed smooth. Smaller burn marks dot his forearms and hands — the constellation every true smith wears. Not classically beautiful — beautiful the way a cathedral is beautiful. Massive, solid, enduring.

HAIR — PRACTICAL AND FORGE-READY:

Black, thick, cut short — practical for forge work, no longer than two inches, natural tight curl creating a dense textured cap. Dusted with metallic particles — gold dust, iron filings, obsidian powder — hair containing embedded stars when forge-light catches it. Broad leather headband across forehead — sweat-stained, worn smooth — with single small jade stone at center. Short, dense beard covering his jaw — neatly trimmed close, touched with grey at the chin. Forge-light catches each hair in sharp highlights.

BODY AND PHYSIQUE:

Upper body bare from waist up — stripped for forge work. Extraordinary physique of years hammering and shaping metal. Massive shoulders — broad, thick, rounded with dense muscle moving beneath sweat-slick skin. Arms the most impressive of any character — forearms like steel cables, biceps like cannonballs, veins in sharp relief. Functional working strength built by labor. Broad deep chest. Burn scars scatter arms and torso — old and silvered, newer and pink — the map of a life's work. Largest scar across left shoulder from molten metal. Hands enormous, calloused, scarred, and absolutely steady. Heavy leather apron from waist to knee, blackened with soot.

BACKGROUND — THE SACRED FORGE CHAMBER:

Deep underground — a vast natural cavern converted to the Sun-Blade order's ceremonial forge. Dark volcanic stone walls rising to shadow. Ancient turquoise-glowing runes in concentric patterns — circles, spirals, stepped-pyramids pulsing with energy. The forge occupies the center — massive basalt blocks carved with Mesoamerican celestial symbols glowing with turquoise energy. White-gold fire burns within — fueled by natural bellows and magical energy. Heat distortion visible — air shimmering and warping above the forge. Centuries-cold stone slowly remembering its purpose.

ATMOSPHERIC EFFECTS:

Forge-light dominates — white-gold blaze illuminating everything. Thousands of sparks in cascading arcs — golden-white points, some frozen mid-air, others trailing streaks. Sparks reflected in sweat-slick skin, polished tools, wet stone floor. Heat-shimmer distorts the upper image. Soot particles float as dark motes catching golden light. Turquoise runes pulse in rhythm — ancient magic responding to creation.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT:

Solkren's face must be positioned entirely BELOW the text area and ABOVE the quote at the bottom. His face occupies roughly the 55%-82% vertical zone. The top 40% must contain ONLY background elements. NO part of his face, body, or the blade may enter the top 35%.
