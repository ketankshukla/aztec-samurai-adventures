SUBJECT — COMMANDING DIPLOMATIC PORTRAIT (THE SILVER TONGUE):

A stunningly handsome young man of Mesoamerican-Mediterranean descent in his late 20s — Zariel, the diplomat-spymaster — positioned in the lower-center of the image, face centered at approximately 60-75% down from the top. He is captured at the precise moment of a decisive gesture — right hand extended forward, palm up, fingers slightly curled as though offering something or commanding attention, while his left hand rests at his side in calculated ease. He stands at the center of a grand negotiation chamber, poised between two worlds, belonging to neither. Every line of his body communicates absolute control — a man who turns conversation into weaponry and makes it look effortless.

FACE — HYPER-DETAILED PHOTOREALISTIC BEAUTY:

Zariel's face is the most classically beautiful of any character — symmetrical, refined, devastating. Aristocratic bone structure — high, broad cheekbones tapering to an elegant jaw, a strong chin with subtle cleft, a high smooth forehead beneath immaculate hair. Rich warm brown skin — darker than Itzil's bronze, with deep amber undertone that makes him glow in warm light. Flawless, luminous complexion — photorealistic pore detail present but minimal. A faint sheen of perspiration at his temples is the only sign the situation is less than perfectly controlled.

His eyes are extraordinary — large, almond-shaped, deep rich amber-brown so warm they contain liquid gold in direct light. Complex layered irises — darker brown outer ring, inner field of warm amber with tiny flecks of true gold. The eyes of a man who looks into your soul while showing you nothing of his. Direct, penetrating, magnetic gaze. Perfect catchlights. Thick, dark lashes — long enough to cast shadows on his upper cheekbones, framing golden eyes like silk curtains around treasure.

Immaculately shaped eyebrows — naturally full and dark with high arch giving perpetual elegant interest. Strong straight nose — perfectly proportioned, the kind portrait painters worship. His lips are his most expressive feature — full, well-defined, natural warm burgundy-brown. Pronounced cupid's bow, fuller lower lip. Currently set in the diplomat's smile — warm, open, genuine-looking, and completely, utterly calculated. Every muscle deliberate. The most dangerous weapon in the room.

Clean-shaven jaw — smooth as polished stone. No scars, no imperfections. He has never been close enough to danger to be touched. Or he's so good that danger never sees him coming.

HAIR — IMMACULATE AND STRIKING:

Jet-black with blue-black sheen — thick, lustrous, swept back from forehead in a clean voluminous wave. Longer on top, shorter at sides — effortlessly perfect. Every strand in place, glossy, catching warm candlelight in sharp highlights. A thin gold chain woven through hair above left ear ending in a tiny obsidian bead — Sun-Blade order marker maintaining diplomatic cover. A few strands at temples shift to reveal the chain beneath.

CLOTHING — DIPLOMATIC ELEGANCE:

Zariel wears no armor — he wears authority. Long coat of deep burgundy-crimson silk — rich, heavy, with subtle geometric weave of interlocking serpents and sun-discs in same-color thread. Falls to calves, open at front, wide sleeves concealing hands when wished. High structured Mesoamerican collar rising to frame his jaw, edged with thin gold embroidery in stepped-pyramid patterns. Beneath, fitted obsidian-black tunic with gold thread accents. Broad jade-green silk sash at waist. Hidden stiletto blade at left hip disguised as decorative letter-opener. Dark leather boots polished to mirror shine. Gold and jade diplomatic medallion bearing the Summit of Nations crest.

BACKGROUND — THE DIPLOMATIC COURT:

Behind Zariel and slightly out of focus, a grand audience chamber — cavernous hall of dark polished stone and crimson banners. Massive black marble columns carved with military victories. Hundreds of floating ash-oath candles — crimson-orange flames pulsing in unison. Dominion diplomats and advisors seated around an obsidian table — dark figures watching with interest and suspicion. A larger figure at the table's head — Volzentar himself, visible only as silhouette and iron crown glint. Polished black floor reflecting everything like dark water.

ATMOSPHERIC EFFECTS:

Ash-oath candle flames cast crimson-gold points across every reflective surface. Fine ash-magic motes swirl in slow hypnotic patterns. Faint incense smoke carrying metallic warmth. Opulent menace — a room designed to intimidate, filled with beauty concealing threat.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT:

Zariel's face must be positioned entirely BELOW the text area and ABOVE the quote at the bottom. His face occupies roughly the 55%-82% vertical zone. The top 40% must contain ONLY background elements. NO part of his face, hair, hands, or body may enter the top 35%.

TEXT — MUST BE RENDERED EXACTLY AS SPECIFIED:

All text is centered horizontally. All percentages measured from the TOP of the image.

OVERALL MOOD AND QUALITY:

Opulent, dangerous, seductive — playing a game where every word is a weapon. Dominant palette: deep crimson, polished black, warm gold. Zariel must be breathtakingly beautiful in a completely different way — refined, controlled, weaponized beauty. The most dangerous person in a room full of dangerous people, and the most terrifying thing about him is that he makes it look easy.

ABSOLUTELY NO oil painting texture. NO watercolor. NO canvas grain. NO painterly edges. PHOTOREALISTIC CINEMATIC DIGITAL ART — sharp, clean, precise, and devastatingly beautiful.
