SUBJECT — ELEMENTAL POWER PORTRAIT (THE WATER WARRIOR):

A stunningly beautiful young woman of indigenous Mesoamerican descent in her early 20s — Rainara, the Water-Knot mystic — positioned in the lower-center of the image, face centered at approximately 60-75% down from the top. She is captured at the apex of her power — arms spread wide, head tilted back slightly, eyes blazing with turquoise-white light as she commands an enormous spiral of water coiling around her body like a living serpent. The water rises from below — dark-tainted liquid transforming as it passes through her hands from sickly black-violet to brilliant luminous turquoise-blue, purified by her mystic gift. She is the eye of a storm made of water and light.

FACE — HYPER-DETAILED PHOTOREALISTIC BEAUTY:

Ethereally beautiful — softer and more mystical than Itzil's warrior intensity. Delicate yet strong bone structure — gently rounded cheekbones creating soft shadows, a heart-shaped face with slightly pointed chin giving an almost elfin quality, smooth broad forehead partially obscured by water-dampened hair. Warm golden-brown skin — lighter than Itzil's bronze, with warm honey undertone making her glow from within. In turquoise light, her skin takes on otherworldly luminescence. Naturally smooth and youthful skin beaded with water droplets clinging to cheeks, forehead, and nose bridge like tiny liquid jewels, each refracting turquoise light into miniature prisms.

Her eyes are the most supernatural feature in the series — large, wide, currently blazing with pure turquoise-white magical energy. Normal state suggested at fading edges: deep sea-green irises with darker teal rings and pale aquamarine striations. At peak power, turquoise energy fills her eyes completely — pupils gone, irises burning with luminous blue-green light spilling from corners in thin trails of turquoise mist streaming past her temples like tears of starlight. Simultaneously beautiful and terrifying.

Long, dark lashes beaded with tiny water droplets hanging from tips like diamonds — each individually rendered. Naturally arched, elegant eyebrows — thinner than Itzil's, giving resting expression of compassionate concern. Small, slightly upturned nose — delicate, almost playful. Beautifully shaped lips — naturally rosy-pink, gentle cupid's bow, full soft lower lip, slightly open in focused concentration. She is performing a miracle and knowing the cost.

Her face is wet — droplets streaming down forehead, cheeks, jaw. Some roll downward, others drift upward or sideways caught in water-magic's pull, creating a halo of floating droplets. A goddess emerging from the ocean.

HAIR — WATER-SWEPT AND MAGNIFICENT:

Deep blue-black with almost iridescent raven-feather quality. Currently soaked and flowing as though submerged — streaming outward and upward in slow, weightless tendrils, each strand individually visible, suspended in magical currents. Wet hair catches turquoise light in brilliant streaks. Some strands cling to face and neck in serpentine curves — across forehead, along cheek, against throat. Woven throughout: thin blue-green thread and tiny carved turquoise water-droplet beads. Small freshwater pearls near temples with blue-green overtones, each glowing with inner luminance. Hair moves with fluid, slow-motion submerged grace.

CLOTHING — WATER-KNOT MYSTIC REGALIA:

Fitted bodice of deep sea-blue fabric shimmering between wet and dry. Reinforced with polished abalone shell panels — iridescent white-blue-green surfaces reflecting magic in rainbow flashes, shaped like overlapping fish scales. Bare arms from biceps down — slender, strong, extended in command. Turquoise energy traces along forearms like luminous veins following blood vessels. Thin silver bracelets on each wrist — mystic focus objects vibrating with resonant energy. Layered blue-green fabric skirt billowing in water-magic influence. Bare feet on wet stone — where soles touch ground, turquoise ripples spread in concentric circles.

BACKGROUND — THE CORRUPTED RIVER AT PURIFICATION:

Behind Rainara and slightly out of focus, a river valley in crisis — wide ancient river with corrupted black-violet waters, crimson blood-magic veins pulsing beneath the surface. Heavy volcanic sky raining obsidian — tiny glass shards falling in hellish precipitation. But around Rainara, a dome of purified water-mist — obsidian shards slow, float, dissolve into harmless sand. She is the calm in the catastrophe, the clean water in the poisoned river.

ATMOSPHERIC EFFECTS:

Water in all forms dominates — corrupted river, purified spiral, obsidian rain, floating face droplets, mist and spray. Corrupted water absorbs light and reflects crimson. Purified water glows turquoise and reflects with crystal clarity. Turquoise magical light radiates from purified water — cool luminous glow pushing back warm crimson corruption. The boundary between turquoise and crimson is sharp and visible — a battle line drawn in color.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT:

Rainara's face must be positioned entirely BELOW the text area and ABOVE the quote at the bottom. Her face occupies roughly the 55%-82% vertical zone. The top 40% must contain ONLY background elements. NO part of her face, hair, or body may enter the top 35%.

TEXT — MUST BE RENDERED EXACTLY AS SPECIFIED:

All text is centered horizontally. All percentages measured from the TOP of the image.

OVERALL MOOD AND QUALITY:

Catastrophic beauty — watching the world drown while one person refuses to let it win. Dominant palette: deep obsidian black, corrupted crimson-violet, brilliant turquoise-blue. Rainara must be ethereally gorgeous — softer, more mystical beauty, but no less powerful. Water itself — adaptable, gentle, capable of wearing down mountains.

ABSOLUTELY NO oil painting texture. NO watercolor. NO canvas grain. NO painterly edges. PHOTOREALISTIC CINEMATIC DIGITAL ART — sharp, clean, precise, and devastatingly beautiful.
