---

A breathtaking ultra-high-resolution photorealistic character portrait rendered at 1600x2400 pixels, 300 DPI, in sharp cinematic digital style with advanced volumetric lighting, ray-traced reflections, and subsurface skin scattering. This must look like a $200-million Hollywood movie poster — every surface, every texture, every particle of light rendered with obsessive photographic precision. ABSOLUTELY NO oil painting, NO watercolor, NO painterly brushstrokes, NO soft-focus artistic filters, NO traditional media aesthetic whatsoever. Every pixel must be razor-sharp, hyper-detailed, and cinematically lit.

SUBJECT — QUIET GENIUS PORTRAIT (THE ENGINEER):

A lean, wiry young man of indigenous Mesoamerican descent in his mid-20s — Torvane, the Engineer — positioned in the lower-center of the image, face centered at approximately 60-75% down from the top. He is captured mid-invention — hunched over a complex mechanical device on a workbench, one hand holding a delicate pair of brass calipers measuring a tiny component, the other hand steadying a half-assembled ward-disruptor that crackles with faint turquoise energy at its core. His eyes are narrowed in absolute concentration, seeing not the device but the system — the invisible architecture of forces and tolerances that will make this machine save lives. Around him, scattered across every surface, are the tools and components of impossible invention.

FACE — HYPER-DETAILED PHOTOREALISTIC INTELLIGENCE:

Torvane's face is quietly handsome in the way that intense focus makes any face compelling — not the dramatic beauty of warriors or diplomats, but the honest, compelling attractiveness of deep intelligence made visible. His bone structure is lean and angular — sharp cheekbones beneath taut skin, a narrow jaw with a slightly pointed chin, and a high forehead that dominates his face with intellectual prominence. His skin is warm brown — medium tone with olive undertones, slightly sallow from spending more time in workshops than sunlight. Photorealistic detail shows fine grease smudges across his right cheekbone and forehead — occupational marks of a man who builds with his hands. Small burn marks from soldering dot his fingers and the backs of his hands.

His eyes are his defining feature — medium brown, wide-set, and extraordinarily alert. These are eyes that see the world as systems — every object a collection of forces, every problem a mechanism to be understood and solved. His gaze is currently fixed on the device with the absolute focus of a man for whom distraction is physically impossible when working. Behind the concentration, there is a quiet warmth — Torvane builds weapons because people he cares about need them, not because he enjoys destruction. Thin-framed brass spectacles perch on his nose — functional, slightly lopsided, one lens scratched from workshop accidents. His lashes are short and straight, his brows drawn together in the permanent furrow of deep thought.

His nose is straight and narrow — precise, functional, like everything about him. His lips are average in fullness, naturally pressed together in concentration, occasionally quirking at one corner when a solution presents itself. His expression is quiet intensity — not the fierce fire of warriors but the steady burn of a mind that never stops working. A small scar on his chin from a workshop explosion. Charcoal smudges on his left temple where he's pushed his hair back with dirty hands.

HAIR — PRACTICAL AND UNKEMPT:

Dark brown, slightly wavy, cut to a practical medium length that he clearly doesn't think about. It falls across his forehead and temples in a perpetually disheveled state — pushed back repeatedly with grease-stained hands, creating unintentional texture. The hair is clean but unstyled — the hair of someone who has more important things to think about. A pair of brass-rimmed magnifying goggles pushed up onto his forehead hold his hair back from his eyes, leaving indentations in the strands where the strap presses.

CLOTHING — INVENTOR'S WORKSHOP ATTIRE:

Torvane wears practical workshop clothing — a fitted dark leather vest over a cream linen shirt with sleeves rolled to his elbows, revealing lean, scarred forearms. The vest has multiple pockets — each containing tools, components, or scribbled notes on folded paper. A thick leather apron protects his torso — shorter than Solkren's forge apron, fitted for bench work, covered in burn marks, chemical stains, and tool scratches. His belt holds a comprehensive tool kit — small hammers, files, pliers, wire cutters, all in individual leather loops. Dark canvas trousers tucked into sturdy leather boots. No weapons visible — his weapons are the devices he builds, and they are devastating.

BACKGROUND — THE ENGINEERING WORKSHOP:

Behind Torvane and slightly out of focus, his personal workshop — a controlled chaos of brilliance. Workbenches covered with half-assembled devices, technical drawings pinned to every wall, shelves of components organized in a system only he understands. Ward-disruptors in various stages of completion. A large tactical map with mechanical markers. Floating turquoise rune-lights provide steady illumination. Through a window, the alliance camp is visible — tents, soldiers, the distant glow of cook-fires. Everything in this room exists to keep those people alive.

ATMOSPHERIC EFFECTS:

Warm workshop lamplight from multiple sources creates a honey-gold ambiance. Faint turquoise sparks from the ward-disruptor under construction. Fine metallic dust motes float in the lamplight. The air smells of oil, heated metal, and possibility. The overall effect is focused creativity — a space where impossible things are made real by one quiet mind.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT:

Torvane's face must be positioned entirely BELOW the text area and ABOVE the quote at the bottom. His face occupies roughly the 55%-82% vertical zone. The top 40% must contain ONLY background elements. NO part of his face, hair, or body may enter the top 35%.

TEXT — MUST BE RENDERED EXACTLY AS SPECIFIED:

All text is centered horizontally. All percentages measured from the TOP of the image.

Line 1 (exactly 3% from top): "AZTEC SAMURAI ADVENTURES" — small elegant Trajan Pro font, turquoise color (#40E0D0), letter-spacing 0.15em, approximately 14pt equivalent. Subtle turquoise glow.

Line 2 (exactly 8-16% from top): "TORVANE" — very large, bold Trajan Pro font, gold color (#FFD700) with warm amber glow and subtle embossed quality. Dominant text element. Letter-spacing 0.15em. Approximately 72-80pt equivalent.

Line 3 (exactly 18% from top): "The Engineer" — medium Trajan Pro font, white/cream with subtle amber warmth. Letter-spacing 0.1em. Approximately 24pt equivalent.

Line 4 (exactly 21% from top): "Alliance Engineer and Inventor" — smaller Trajan Pro font, turquoise color (#40E0D0). Letter-spacing 0.1em. Approximately 16pt equivalent.

Line 5 (exactly 24% from top): "Quiet Genius · Builder of Impossible Machines" — small italic Trajan Pro, light cream/gold. Approximately 12pt equivalent.

Decorative ornamental line (exactly 26% from top): Elegant gold and turquoise ornamental filigree divider — Aztec-inspired geometric scrollwork with gear and mechanism motifs. Gold (#FFD700) with turquoise (#40E0D0) accents.

Line 6 (exactly 92% from top): "It's not beautiful yet. It's honest. That's different." — italic Trajan Pro font, centered, cream/white with subtle amber glow, enclosed in elegant quotation marks. Approximately 14pt equivalent.

OVERALL MOOD AND QUALITY:

Focused, warm, quietly heroic — the feeling of watching the invisible hero do the work that saves everyone and asking for nothing in return. Dominant palette: warm amber, brass-gold, cream, and turquoise sparks. Torvane must be compellingly real — not glamorous but magnetic in the way deep intelligence and quiet dedication are magnetic. The most dangerous weapon in the alliance is his mind.

ABSOLUTELY NO oil painting texture. NO watercolor. NO canvas grain. NO painterly edges. PHOTOREALISTIC CINEMATIC DIGITAL ART — sharp, clean, precise, and devastatingly beautiful.
