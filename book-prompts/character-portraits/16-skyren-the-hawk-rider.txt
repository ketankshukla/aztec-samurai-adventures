SUBJECT — AERIAL WARRIOR PORTRAIT (THE HAWK RIDER):

A strikingly gorgeous young woman of indigenous Mesoamerican descent in her early 20s — Skyren, the hawk rider — positioned in the lower-center of the image, face centered at approximately 60-75% down from the top. She is captured in the most dynamic pose — leaning forward from the back of an enormous war-hawk in a steep diving attack, one hand gripping a leather harness strap, the other arm extended with a long javelin poised to throw. Her body angled at forty-five degrees, hair and feathered cloak streaming behind her. Below — visible past her outstretched arm — the ground rushes upward, battlefield and burning forest from a thousand feet. Gravity defied, speed incarnate, absolutely fearless.

FACE — HYPER-DETAILED PHOTOREALISTIC BEAUTY:

Strikingly beautiful in a wild, windswept way — fierce, untamed joy. Strong, angular bone structure — sharp cheekbones jutting prominently with deep dramatic shadows, a narrow chin giving fox-like quality, high forehead half-hidden by wind-whipped hair. Deep copper-brown skin — darkest of female characters — with warm red undertones making her glow like polished copper in sunlight. Weathered by altitude and wind — slightly roughened at cheekbones, naturally flushed across nose and upper cheeks from cold flight altitude, tiny sun-creases at outer eye corners from squinting against high winds.

Her eyes are spectacular — large, slightly upturned at outer corners giving predatory hawkish quality mirroring her mount. Startling golden-amber irises — exact color of a raptor's eye — with darker burnt orange outer ring and deep brown flecks near pupils. In high-altitude sunlight, eyes glow with inner fire — golden, keen, impossibly alive. Pupils contracted to small points by brilliant light, making golden irises dominant and devastating. Two brilliant white catchlights — reflections of open sky. Thick, dark but short lashes — practical, windproof, framing golden eyes like a hawk's orbital bone rim.

Strong, slightly wild eyebrows — windblown, individual hairs catching light. Thin white scar through outer right eyebrow — training injury from a young hawk's talon. Sharp, slightly hooked nose — raptor-like, distinctive, aquiline. Wind-chapped but beautifully shaped lips — warm brown-pink, slightly dry, lower fuller than upper, currently pulled back in fierce grin of exhilaration. Teeth flash white against dark skin. She is grinning because she is diving at an enemy from a thousand feet with a javelin and a war-hawk. Best moment of her life.

Wind distorts her face slightly — flattening cheeks, pressing eyelids, pulling lips back — the photorealistic effect of high-speed aerial descent. Raw, real, thrillingly alive.

HAIR — WIND-STREAMED AND FEATHERED:

Jet-black, thick, very long — tight central braid from forehead to skull base with remaining length flowing freely. Braid decorated with hawk feathers woven directly into plaiting — small brown-and-white barred and spotted feathers with barbule-level detail. Free length streams behind in dive's wind — banner of black silk and scattered feathers stretching three feet, strands separating and catching high-altitude sunlight. Loose strands whip across face — across forehead, cheek, one caught between lips. Small downy feathers float around her head suspended in turbulence.

THE WAR-HAWK — CIELOVAR:

Partially visible behind and beneath — massive body forming her platform. Enormous — twenty-foot wingspan, horse-sized, built for war and speed. Upper portion visible — broad muscular back, base of one wing extended backward in dive position, head with lethal curved beak in profile past her left shoulder. Plumage rendered with obsessive detail — deep brown-black primaries with cream-and-rust barred patterns, tawny-gold mantle, white throat flash. Each feather individually visible. Golden-amber eye locked forward with predatory focus. Leather harness with brass fittings and obsidian studs.

ARMOR — HAWK RIDER'S KIT:

Fitted leather vest reinforced with thin bone plates shaped like overlapping feathers — carved from lightweight war-hawk bone, ivory-white with amber translucence. Brass buckle quick-release straps. Fitted leather arm sleeves with articulated joints. Heavy leather bracer on right forearm — landing perch scarred with talon marks. Fingerless glove on left hand. Feathered cloak streaming behind — short, waist-length, actual hawk feathers on leather backing. Slender six-foot javelin with obsidian point and hawk-feather fletching. Three more javelins in back rack.

BACKGROUND — HIGH-ALTITUDE AERIAL BATTLEFIELD:

Vast aerial battlefield from extreme altitude — distant ground patchwork of terrain, forests, fields, winding river. Collapsing sky-prison of dark stone and iron held by crystallized blood-magic chains breaking apart — crimson energy arcing between snapping chains, masonry chunks falling trailing smoke. Other hawk riders wheeling and diving. Dominion bat-winged aerial beasts in desperate dogfights creating contrails of smoke. Sky vast and brilliant — high-altitude blue approaching violet at zenith, golden haze at horizon. Towering cumulus formations. Vertiginous altitude — ground very far away.

ATMOSPHERIC EFFECTS:

Crisp high-altitude atmosphere — every detail sharp. Intense, golden, direct sunlight. Strong highlights and deep shadows on her face. Wind effects everywhere — hair streaming, feathers ruffling, plumage compressed, debris spinning. Overwhelming sense of speed — motion blur at extreme frame edges, rushing compressed ground.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT:

Skyren's face must be positioned entirely BELOW the text area and ABOVE the quote at the bottom. Her face occupies roughly the 55%-82% vertical zone. The top 40% must contain ONLY background elements. NO part of her face, hair, hawk, or body may enter the top 35%.
