SUBJECT — BRUTAL POWER PORTRAIT (THE BEAST COMMANDER):

A massive, towering man of mixed Mesoamerican and Northern heritage in his late 30s — Gravok, the Beast Commander — positioned in the lower-center of the image, face centered at approximately 60-75% down from the top. He is captured standing before his war-beasts — enormous armored predators visible in shadow behind him — one hand resting on the scarred head of a massive war-hound that reaches his waist, the other hand gripping a brutal, oversized war-hammer resting on his shoulder. His body is a wall of muscle and armor — the largest human figure in the entire series. He radiates brute, overwhelming physical power — the kind of man who doesn't need strategy because he IS the strategy.

FACE — HYPER-DETAILED PHOTOREALISTIC BRUTALITY:

Gravok's face is not handsome — it is powerful, brutal, and unforgettable. Heavy, blunt bone structure — a wide, flat face with prominent brow ridges casting deep shadows over his eyes, a massive square jaw that looks like it was designed to take punches, and a low, heavy forehead scarred and weathered. His skin is weathered dark brown — rough, sun-damaged, the texture of leather that has been beaten by every element. His face is a map of violence — a thick scar bisecting his right eyebrow and continuing down across his cheek, a crooked nose broken multiple times and never set, a chunk missing from the top of his left ear. Photorealistic detail shows every pore, every scar, every weather-beaten crease.

His eyes are small, deep-set beneath the heavy brow — dark brown, almost black, burning with feral intelligence that belies his brutish appearance. These are the eyes of a man who understands war-beasts better than people — who can read the body language of a predator from a hundred yards and knows exactly how to command absolute loyalty through strength. His gaze is direct, challenging, predatory — the stare of the alpha in any pack. His brows are thick and scarred, perpetually furrowed.

His nose is wide, crooked, and flat — broken so many times it has lost any original shape. His lips are thick, scarred, set in a grim line. A thick beard covers his jaw — dark brown streaked with grey, roughly trimmed, the kind of beard that gets in the way of nothing. His expression is pure physical intimidation — not cruel, not sadistic, just overwhelmingly, undeniably dangerous. A man-mountain who has never met a problem that force couldn't solve.

HAIR — BRUTAL AND FUNCTIONAL:

Dark brown, coarse, shaved close on the sides in a warrior's cut with the top left longer and pulled back in a thick, rough knot. The hair is streaked with premature grey — stress and war aging him beyond his years. Leather cord binds the topknot. No decoration — function only. His scalp shows scars through the shaved sections.

CLOTHING AND ARMOR — WAR-BEAST MASTER:

Gravok wears the heaviest armor in the series — massive plates of dark iron and thick leather over a frame of chain mail. The armor is custom-built for his enormous frame — wide shoulder plates bearing the Dominion's iron crown insignia, a chest plate thick enough to stop a lance, and arm guards reinforced with iron studs. The armor is battered, dented, scarred by claws and blades — the armor of a man who leads from the front and takes the first blow. Thick leather straps secure the plates, each one bearing the claw-marks of war-beasts. A massive war-hammer rests on his shoulder — the head a block of dark iron the size of a man's head, the haft wrapped in beast-hide leather. His other hand — enormous, scarred, calloused — rests on the war-hound beside him.

BACKGROUND — THE WAR-BEAST KENNELS:

Behind Gravok and slightly out of focus, the Dominion's war-beast kennels — a vast, dark compound of iron cages and stone pens. Massive predatory shapes move in the shadows — war-hounds, scaled beasts, armored creatures bred for war. Ember-red eyes glow in the darkness. Chains rattle. The air is thick with the presence of controlled violence. Crimson torchlight reflects off wet stone and iron bars. This is a place of terrifying power harnessed by one man's will.

ATMOSPHERIC EFFECTS:

Warm crimson torchlight creates dramatic shadows across Gravok's scarred face and massive frame. Ember-red war-beast eyes glow in the darkness behind him. Steam rises from the kennels in the cold air. The atmosphere is primal, dangerous, the boundary between civilization and feral savagery — and Gravok stands on both sides.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT:

Gravok's face must be positioned entirely BELOW the text area and ABOVE the quote at the bottom. His face occupies roughly the 55%-82% vertical zone. The top 40% must contain ONLY background elements. NO part of his face, hair, or body may enter the top 35%.

TEXT — MUST BE RENDERED EXACTLY AS SPECIFIED:

OVERALL MOOD AND QUALITY:

Primal, overwhelming, terrifyingly physical — the feeling of standing before a force of nature shaped like a man. Dominant palette: dark iron, crimson torchlight, ember-red, deep shadow. Gravok must radiate unstoppable physical power — not beautiful, not graceful, but unforgettable and deeply human beneath the brutality.
