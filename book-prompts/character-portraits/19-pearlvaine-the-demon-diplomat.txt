SUBJECT — SEDUCTIVE MENACE PORTRAIT (THE DEMON DIPLOMAT):

A stunningly elegant woman of mixed Mesoamerican and Mediterranean heritage in her mid-30s — Pearlvaine, the Dominion's demon-bonded negotiator — positioned in the lower-center of the image, face centered at approximately 60-75% down from the top. She is captured mid-negotiation — seated in an ornate chair at the head of a diplomatic table, one leg crossed over the other with effortless elegance, one hand gesturing with precise, hypnotic grace while the other rests on the chair's arm. Her fingers trail faint wisps of amber-gold persuasion energy — the demon-enhanced magic that makes any truth sound like exactly what the listener wants to hear. Her posture radiates warmth, charm, and absolute danger — the most welcoming trap ever set.

FACE — HYPER-DETAILED PHOTOREALISTIC SEDUCTIVE BEAUTY:

Pearlvaine's face is the most conventionally beautiful villain in the series — warm, open, and devastatingly attractive in a way designed to disarm. Her bone structure is elegant — high cheekbones with soft curves rather than sharp angles, a heart-shaped face with a graceful jaw, and a smooth forehead that radiates approachability. Her skin is a warm olive-gold — luminous, healthy, glowing with the kind of perfection that makes people trust her instinctively. Her complexion shows no sign of the demon-bond that powers her — externally, she is flawless. Photorealistic detail shows smooth, dewy skin with a natural warmth that draws the eye.

Her eyes are her primary weapon — large, wide-set, and a deep, warm hazel-gold that shifts between green and amber depending on the light. When her persuasion magic is active, tiny flecks of amber light dance within her irises — so subtle most people don't notice them, mistaking the supernatural glow for natural beauty. Her gaze is warm, direct, and devastatingly intimate — the kind of eye contact that makes every person feel like the most important person in the room. Her lashes are long, dark, naturally lush — framing those warm dangerous eyes in velvet.

Her eyebrows are elegantly arched — groomed but natural, giving her face an expression of engaged, attentive interest. Her nose is straight and refined — neither small nor prominent, simply perfect. Her lips are her second weapon — full, naturally reddish-pink, with a wide, genuine-looking smile that radiates warmth and trustworthiness. When she speaks, people lean forward. When she stops speaking, people agree. Her expression is the most dangerous thing in the portrait — pure, authentic warmth that makes you forget she is rearranging the truth inside your head.

A tiny, almost invisible mark behind her left ear — the demon-bond sigil, hidden by her hair — is the only physical sign of what she truly is.

HAIR — PERFECTED ELEGANCE:

Rich dark brown hair with warm auburn highlights — thick, lustrous, and styled with deliberate sophistication. Swept into an elegant updo at the back of her head — soft, loose, romantic rather than severe — with carefully arranged curling tendrils framing her face at the temples and jawline. The auburn highlights catch warm candlelight in copper and gold tones. A single decorative comb of gold and jade holds the updo — elegant, diplomatic, and concealing the demon-bond mark behind her ear. Her hair looks effortless. Nothing about her is effortless.

CLOTHING — DIPLOMATIC ELEGANCE:

Pearlvaine wears luxurious diplomatic robes — layers of rich amber-gold and deep emerald silk that move like liquid as she gestures. The outer robe is long, flowing, embroidered with subtle Dominion patterns in same-tone gold thread — visible only at certain angles, like secrets hidden in plain sight. A high collar frames her neck and jaw elegantly. Gold jewelry at her throat — a delicate chain bearing a small amber stone that pulses faintly with contained persuasion energy. Gold rings on her fingers, each one catching candlelight. She looks like wealth, taste, and trustworthiness personified.

BACKGROUND — THE NEUTRAL SUMMIT CHAMBER:

Behind Pearlvaine and slightly out of focus, a grand neutral diplomatic chamber — lighter and more open than Dominion architecture. Pale stone walls, tall windows letting in warm daylight, a massive round negotiation table of polished wood. Representatives from multiple nations sit around the table — blurred figures in various national dress, all leaning slightly toward Pearlvaine, all wearing expressions of engaged agreement. They are agreeing to things that will destroy them. They don't know it yet. Warm sunlight and candle-glow create an atmosphere of trust and openness — the perfect setting for the most elegant betrayal.

ATMOSPHERIC EFFECTS:

Warm amber-gold light dominates — a combination of sunlight and candle-glow that makes everything feel safe and welcoming. Faint wisps of amber persuasion energy trail from Pearlvaine's gesturing hand — so subtle they could be dust motes in sunlight. The air feels warm, intimate, trustworthy. Everything in this scene is designed to make you lower your guard.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT:

Pearlvaine's face must be positioned entirely BELOW the text area and ABOVE the quote at the bottom. Her face occupies roughly the 55%-82% vertical zone. The top 40% must contain ONLY background elements. NO part of her face, hair, or body may enter the top 35%.
