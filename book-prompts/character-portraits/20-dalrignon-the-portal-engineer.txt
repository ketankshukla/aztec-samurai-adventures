CHARACTER PORTRAIT: DALRIGNON — THE PORTAL ENGINEER
TYPE: Character Portrait (matching ebook cover quality)
DIMENSIONS: 1600 x 2400 pixels, 300 DPI, sRGB color profile

---

A breathtaking ultra-high-resolution photorealistic character portrait rendered at 1600x2400 pixels, 300 DPI, in sharp cinematic digital style with advanced volumetric lighting, ray-traced reflections, and subsurface skin scattering. This must look like a $200-million Hollywood movie poster — every surface, every texture, every particle of light rendered with obsessive photographic precision. ABSOLUTELY NO oil painting, NO watercolor, NO painterly brushstrokes, NO soft-focus artistic filters, NO traditional media aesthetic whatsoever. Every pixel must be razor-sharp, hyper-detailed, and cinematically lit.

SUBJECT — MAD GENIUS PORTRAIT (THE PORTAL ENGINEER):

A wiry, intense man of Eastern-Mesoamerican descent in his late 30s — Dalrignon, the Portal Engineer — positioned in the lower-center of the image, face centered at approximately 60-75% down from the top. He is captured in a moment of manic creation — standing before a half-constructed mirror-portal, both hands deep inside the mechanism, manipulating crystallized soul-energy conduits with the frenzied precision of a man racing a deadline he cannot miss. His face is lit from below by the portal's violet-white energy, creating dramatic uplighting that makes him look both brilliant and deranged. Sparks of spatial distortion ripple around his hands — reality bending at his fingertips.

FACE — HYPER-DETAILED PHOTOREALISTIC INTENSITY:

Dalrignon's face is sharp and foxlike — handsome in a feverish, unstable way that makes people uncomfortable. Narrow, angular bone structure — high cheekbones that jut sharply beneath taut skin, a narrow jaw tapering to a pointed chin, and a high, domed forehead that seems too large for his face — the forehead of a mind that never stops building. His skin is sallow olive — unhealthy, underlit, the complexion of someone who sleeps three hours a night and subsists on obsession. Dark circles under his eyes are permanent — deep purple-grey smudges that speak of years of sleeplessness. His skin shows the fine sheen of nervous perspiration.

His eyes are his most striking feature — wide, pale green-grey, and burning with feverish intelligence. These are the eyes of a man who sees spatial geometry the way musicians hear notes — instinctively, obsessively, unable to stop. His pupils are dilated despite the bright portal-light — a sign of the stimulants he takes to keep working. His gaze has the unfocused intensity of someone who is simultaneously seeing the physical world and the mathematical framework beneath it. His lashes are sparse and light, his brows perpetually raised in an expression of frantic, excited discovery.

His nose is long and sharp — prominent, beak-like, giving him a hawkish intensity. His lips are thin, dry, chapped — the lips of someone who forgets to eat and drink while working. His mouth is set in a tight, excited grimace — teeth slightly visible, the expression of a man who has just solved a problem that will kill thousands and doesn't care because the MATH IS BEAUTIFUL. A thin trickle of blood runs from his left nostril — the physical cost of channeling portal-energy through human hands. He doesn't notice.

HAIR — FRANTIC AND NEGLECTED:

Dark brown, fine, and wildly unkempt — standing at odd angles from repeatedly running his hands through it in moments of frustration or breakthrough. Longer than it should be — he hasn't had it cut in months. Greasy and lank near the roots, dry and brittle at the tips. A pair of magnifying goggles pushed up onto his forehead hold back the worst of it. Streaks of silver-white energy residue — portal-dust — streak through his hair like premature grey, though they wash out. Or they used to wash out.

CLOTHING — ENGINEER'S OBSESSION:

Dalrignon wears a heavy leather workshop coat — long, fitted, covered in burn marks, chemical stains, and spatial-distortion scorch patterns that shimmer faintly with residual violet energy. The coat has dozens of pockets — each stuffed with tools, crystal fragments, scribbled calculations on folded paper. Beneath, a dark tunic that was once fine and is now stained and worn. Heavy gloves — one on, one off — the bare hand working inside the portal mechanism, the skin of that hand showing faint violet veins where portal-energy has begun to permanently mark him. His belt holds specialized tools — crystal cutters, spatial calipers, a small hammer for adjusting resonance frequencies. No weapons. His portals are his weapons.

BACKGROUND — THE PORTAL CONSTRUCTION LABORATORY:

Behind Dalrignon and slightly out of focus, his construction laboratory — a vast underground chamber filled with half-built mirror-portals in various stages of completion. Each portal is a dark iron frame surrounding a shimmering surface of violet-white energy — some active, some dormant, some cracked and leaking spatial distortion. Crystallized soul-energy conduits — glowing blue-white crystals in dark metal housings — line the walls in organized racks. Technical drawings and calculations cover every flat surface — pinned, taped, nailed to the walls in overlapping layers. The chamber hums with contained spatial energy.

ATMOSPHERIC EFFECTS:

Violet-white portal energy creates harsh, shifting illumination — light that seems to come from everywhere and nowhere. Spatial distortion ripples visible around active portals — reality bending like heat haze. Fine crystal dust floats in the air, catching portal-light in tiny violet sparks. The air itself feels wrong — slightly compressed, slightly stretched, as though the room exists in multiple spatial locations simultaneously.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT:

Dalrignon's face must be positioned entirely BELOW the text area and ABOVE the quote at the bottom. His face occupies roughly the 55%-82% vertical zone. The top 40% must contain ONLY background elements. NO part of his face, hair, or body may enter the top 35%.

TEXT — MUST BE RENDERED EXACTLY AS SPECIFIED:

All text is centered horizontally. All percentages measured from the TOP of the image.

Line 1 (exactly 3% from top): "AZTEC SAMURAI ADVENTURES" — small elegant Trajan Pro font, turquoise color (#40E0D0), letter-spacing 0.15em, approximately 14pt equivalent. Subtle turquoise glow.

Line 2 (exactly 8-16% from top): "DALRIGNON" — very large, bold Trajan Pro font, gold color (#FFD700) with violet edge glow and subtle embossed quality. Dominant text element. Letter-spacing 0.12em. Approximately 64-72pt equivalent.

Line 3 (exactly 18% from top): "The Portal Engineer" — medium Trajan Pro font, white/cream with subtle violet shimmer. Letter-spacing 0.1em. Approximately 24pt equivalent.

Line 4 (exactly 21% from top): "Mirror-Portal Builder" — smaller Trajan Pro font, violet-silver color. Letter-spacing 0.1em. Approximately 16pt equivalent.

Line 5 (exactly 24% from top): "Brilliant Amoral Engineer · Sees Atrocity as Innovation" — small italic Trajan Pro, light cream/violet. Approximately 12pt equivalent.

Decorative ornamental line (exactly 26% from top): Elegant gold and violet ornamental filigree divider — Aztec-inspired geometric scrollwork with mirror-shard and portal-frame motifs. Gold (#FFD700) with violet accents.

Line 6 (exactly 92% from top): "BUILD FASTER." — bold Trajan Pro font, centered, cream/white with harsh violet glow, enclosed in elegant quotation marks. Approximately 16pt equivalent.

OVERALL MOOD AND QUALITY:

Feverish, brilliant, deeply unsettling — the feeling of watching genius consume itself in service of atrocity. Dominant palette: violet-white, harsh silver, sallow olive, and deep shadow. Dalrignon must radiate unstable, obsessive intelligence — not evil by intention, but so consumed by the beauty of his work that he has stopped seeing the horror of its application.

ABSOLUTELY NO oil painting texture. NO watercolor. NO canvas grain. NO painterly edges. PHOTOREALISTIC CINEMATIC DIGITAL ART — sharp, clean, precise, and devastatingly beautiful.
