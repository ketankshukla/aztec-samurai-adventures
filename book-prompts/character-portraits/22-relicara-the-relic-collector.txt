SUBJECT — OBSESSIVE COLLECTOR PORTRAIT (THE RELIC HOARDER):

A striking woman of Mesoamerican descent in her early 40s — Relicara, the Relic Collector — positioned in the lower-center of the image, face centered at approximately 60-75% down from the top. She is captured in her element — standing in the center of her fortress-cathedral of stolen artifacts, one hand cradling a glowing relic against her chest with possessive reverence, the other hand extended protectively as though warding away anyone who might touch her collection. She is surrounded by her treasures — shelves, cases, and pedestals of stolen magical artifacts, each one pulsing with a different color of contained energy. Her eyes burn with the fervent devotion of someone who loves objects more than people.

FACE — HYPER-DETAILED PHOTOREALISTIC OBSESSIVE BEAUTY:

Relicara's face is striking in an intense, sharp-edged way — beautiful but unsettling, the face of someone whose passion has consumed everything soft. Angular bone structure — high, narrow cheekbones that create severe shadows, a strong jaw set with permanent tension, a high forehead that furrows with proprietary concern. Her skin is warm brown with cool undertones — well-maintained but showing the strain of obsession: faint shadows beneath her eyes, tension lines between her brows, the slightly hollowed cheeks of someone who forgets meals when a new acquisition arrives. Photorealistic detail shows skin that is cared for but stressed — the face of wealth directed entirely at acquisition rather than self.

Her eyes are large, dark, and burning with possessive intensity — deep brown irises with a ring of amber that seems to pulse when she looks at her relics. These are the eyes of a true collector — eyes that can assess the provenance, power, and value of any magical artifact in seconds. Her gaze at her collection is tender, intimate, almost romantic — the most genuine emotion she shows. Her lashes are long and dark, her brows strong and perpetually drawn together in protective concentration.

Her nose is sharp and aquiline — prominent, aristocratic, the nose of someone who looks down at everything and everyone. Her lips are well-shaped but perpetually pressed thin — the mouth of someone who says "mine" more than any other word. Her expression is fierce possession — a dragon guarding her hoard, a mother protecting her children, except her children are stolen power and her love is obsession.

HAIR — ELABORATE AND CONTROLLED:

Dark black hair, thick and lustrous, elaborately styled in complex braids and coils piled high on her head — the most elaborate hairstyle of any villain, a crown of her own making. Woven throughout her hair are tiny stolen artifacts — miniature relics, glowing gems, fragments of magical objects — each one a trophy, a reminder of a successful acquisition. Gold pins and chains hold the structure together, catching light from the surrounding relics. Her hair is a display case as much as a hairstyle.

CLOTHING — COLLECTOR'S REGALIA:

Relicara wears layered robes of deep purple and burnished gold — the colors of royalty and acquisition. The outer robe is heavy brocade embroidered with catalog numbers and acquisition dates in gold thread — she literally wears her inventory. Beneath, fitted black silk. Around her neck, wrists, and fingers: stolen artifacts worn as jewelry — a pendant that pulses blue, rings that glow amber, a bracelet of linked relic-fragments. Each piece is labeled in her mind: origin, power, value, acquisition method. A heavy key ring hangs from her belt — the keys to her vault, her cathedral, her kingdom of stolen things.

BACKGROUND — THE FORTRESS-CATHEDRAL OF ARTIFACTS:

Behind Relicara and slightly out of focus, her fortress-cathedral — a vast, cathedral-scale chamber filled with stolen magical artifacts. Floor-to-ceiling display cases of dark wood and enchanted glass. Pedestals bearing glowing relics — each one individually lit, carefully positioned, lovingly maintained. The collection spans centuries — ancient weapons, crystallized magic, bound spirits, sacred objects from every culture on the continent. Each item pulses with its own color of magical energy, creating a rainbow of stolen power. The space is meticulously organized — Relicara's obsession expressed as absolute order.

ATMOSPHERIC EFFECTS:

Multicolored relic-light creates a kaleidoscopic illumination — blue, amber, green, violet, gold — each artifact contributing its own glow. The combined light creates a shifting, prismatic atmosphere. Fine magical particles drift in the air — residual energy from so many powerful objects in close proximity. The space hums with contained power. The overall effect is beautiful, covetous, and deeply wrong — a treasury of stolen souls presented as a museum.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT:

Relicara's face must be positioned entirely BELOW the text area and ABOVE the quote at the bottom. Her face occupies roughly the 55%-82% vertical zone. The top 40% must contain ONLY background elements. NO part of her face, hair, or body may enter the top 35%.
