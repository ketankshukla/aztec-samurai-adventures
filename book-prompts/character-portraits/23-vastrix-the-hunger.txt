TYPE: Character Portrait (matching ebook cover quality)
DIMENSIONS: 1600 x 2400 pixels, 300 DPI, sRGB color profile

---

A breathtaking ultra-high-resolution photorealistic character portrait rendered at 1600x2400 pixels, 300 DPI, in sharp cinematic digital style with advanced volumetric lighting, ray-traced reflections, and subsurface skin scattering. This must look like a $200-million Hollywood movie poster — every surface, every texture, every particle of light rendered with obsessive photographic precision. ABSOLUTELY NO oil painting, NO watercolor, NO painterly brushstrokes, NO soft-focus artistic filters, NO traditional media aesthetic whatsoever. Every pixel must be razor-sharp, hyper-detailed, and cinematically lit.

SUBJECT — COSMIC HORROR PORTRAIT (THE HUNGER):

Vastrix is not a person — it is a dimension made of hunger wearing the suggestion of a form. Positioned in the lower-center of the image, occupying approximately 50-85% of the vertical space. The entity manifests as a colossal, vaguely humanoid shape composed entirely of void-darkness — absolute black, darker than the surrounding space, as though a hole has been cut in reality itself. The shape is massive — shoulders wider than mountains, a head that is more suggestion than form, arms that trail into tendrils of dark energy extending in every direction. Where its eyes should be, two enormous points of dead-star light burn — not bright, but anti-bright, emitting a crimson-black radiance that devours light rather than creating it. Above its head, the Starless Crown manifests — a crown-shaped constellation of consumed stars, each point a void where light once existed.

THE FORM — COSMIC SCALE HORROR:

Vastrix's body is composed of layered darkness — multiple depths of black that shift and move like something alive beneath the surface. The outer layer is smoke-like — wisps and tendrils of void-energy that drift outward from the main form, reaching, grasping, hungry. The inner layer is solid darkness — absolute, impenetrable, a black so complete it absorbs every photon that touches it. Between the layers, faint patterns move — suggestions of faces, hands, mouths, consumed souls pressing against the inside of Vastrix's form like prisoners against a membrane. They are not screaming. They are being digested.

The entity's "face" — if it can be called that — is the most terrifying image in the series. No features exist in the traditional sense. Instead, the void-darkness shapes itself into the barest suggestion of a face — two massive eyes of dead-star crimson-black light, a darker-than-dark region where a mouth might be that opens into an infinity of hunger. The face shifts and reforms constantly — never quite the same shape for two consecutive moments, as though Vastrix cannot decide what form to terrify you with. The dead-star eyes are fixed directly at the viewer — breaking the fourth wall, staring through the portrait into the real world. You are being seen.

THE STARLESS CROWN:

Floating above the entity's head, the Starless Crown — its primary manifestation in the physical world. A crown-shaped constellation of absolute void — seven points of complete darkness where stars should be, surrounded by the faintest halo of devoured starlight that has been partially digested and re-emitted as sickly crimson-violet energy. The Crown dominates the upper portion of the portrait — vast, terrible, a wound in the sky that will not heal. From each crown-point, tendrils of anti-light reach downward, merging with Vastrix's form.

BACKGROUND — THE SPACE BETWEEN WORLDS:

Behind Vastrix, the dimension beyond the Great Gate — a space that is not space, a void that is not empty but FULL. Full of hunger. The "sky" is a roiling mass of void-darkness punctuated by the dying light of consumed realities — distant points of fading amber and gold being slowly devoured by creeping darkness. The "ground" does not exist — Vastrix floats in the void, a predator in its natural habitat. Far below (or above, or in every direction), the faint outline of the Great Gate is visible — a tiny arch of stone and rune-light, impossibly small compared to the entity pressing against it, the fragile barrier between this dimension and the world it wants to consume.

ATMOSPHERIC EFFECTS:

Anti-light radiates from Vastrix — not illumination but the opposite, a darkness that actively consumes surrounding light. Where the anti-light touches the edge of the image, colors desaturate and fade. Crimson-black energy crackles around the entity like lightning in reverse — dark bolts that absorb rather than emit. The consumed souls within its form press outward in waves, creating rippling distortions across the void-darkness surface. The Starless Crown's anti-light creates a halo of devoured color — a ring of sickly crimson-violet at the boundary between void and reality. The overall effect is cosmic, primal, and deeply, viscerally terrifying — not the fear of a monster, but the fear of an empty stomach the size of a universe.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — ENTITY PLACEMENT:

Vastrix's form must be positioned so that the "face" area sits at approximately 55%-75% vertical zone. The Starless Crown occupies the 30%-45% zone. The top 25% of the image (where text will be placed) must contain ONLY the void-sky and distant dying stars. The text area must be clear of the Crown's primary features.

TEXT — MUST BE RENDERED EXACTLY AS SPECIFIED:

All text is centered horizontally. All percentages measured from the TOP of the image.

Line 1 (exactly 3% from top): "AZTEC SAMURAI ADVENTURES" — small elegant Trajan Pro font, turquoise color (#40E0D0), letter-spacing 0.15em, approximately 14pt equivalent. Subtle turquoise glow — faintly flickering, as though the anti-light is trying to consume it.

Line 2 (exactly 8-16% from top): "VASTRIX" — very large, bold Trajan Pro font, gold color (#FFD700) with crimson-black edge glow that seems to eat the edges of each letter. Dominant text element. Letter-spacing 0.15em. Approximately 72-80pt equivalent. The letters appear to vibrate faintly — reality distortion.

Line 3 (exactly 18% from top): "The Hunger Beyond the Gate" — medium Trajan Pro font, white/cream with unsettling crimson-violet edge bleed. Letter-spacing 0.1em. Approximately 24pt equivalent.

Line 4 (exactly 21% from top): "Cosmic Entity" — smaller Trajan Pro font, crimson-black color that seems to absorb surrounding light. Letter-spacing 0.1em. Approximately 16pt equivalent.

Line 5 (exactly 24% from top): "A Dimension Made of Hunger · Crown of Dead Stars" — small italic Trajan Pro, light cream with crimson-violet corruption at the edges. Approximately 12pt equivalent.

Decorative ornamental line (exactly 26% from top): Gold ornamental filigree divider — but corrupted, the Aztec scrollwork partially consumed by void-darkness, the gold dimming and cracking at the center as though Vastrix's influence is destroying even the decorative elements. Gold (#FFD700) bleeding into crimson-black.

Line 6 (exactly 92% from top): "I SEE YOU. ALL OF YOU. AND I AM HUNGRY." — bold Trajan Pro font, centered, crimson-white with pulsing void-glow, enclosed in elegant quotation marks. Approximately 16pt equivalent. The text appears to pulse — brighter, dimmer, brighter — like a heartbeat.

OVERALL MOOD AND QUALITY:

Cosmic, primordial, existentially terrifying — the feeling of realizing you are prey in a universe where the apex predator is hunger itself. Dominant palette: absolute void-black, dead-star crimson, sickly violet, and the fading amber of consumed light. Vastrix must evoke not monster-movie fear but the deeper, older terror of insignificance — the understanding that something vast and mindless and hungry knows you exist and considers you food.

ABSOLUTELY NO oil painting texture. NO watercolor. NO canvas grain. NO painterly edges. PHOTOREALISTIC CINEMATIC DIGITAL ART — sharp, clean, precise, and devastatingly beautiful.
