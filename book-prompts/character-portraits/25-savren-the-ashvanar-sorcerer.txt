SUBJECT — DARK SORCERY PORTRAIT (THE ASHVANAR SORCERER):

A lean, sharp-featured man of Eastern-Mesoamerican descent in his late 20s — Savren, one of the Ashvanar twin sorcerers — positioned in the lower-center of the image, face centered at approximately 60-75% down from the top. He is captured in a moment of devastating magical discharge — both hands raised, fingers splayed, as arcs of crackling violet-black lightning and streams of corrosive acid-green energy erupt from his palms in spiraling, intertwined patterns. His body is taut with channeled power — back arched, head tilted slightly back, robes whipping in the magical backdraft. He is the Dominion's precision instrument of destruction — fast, controlled, and lethal.

FACE — HYPER-DETAILED PHOTOREALISTIC SHARP BEAUTY:

Savren's face is sharply handsome — identical to his twin Gravos but pristine, unscarred, and radiating cold control. Narrow, angular bone structure — high, sharp cheekbones creating blade-like shadows, a narrow jaw with a pointed chin, a high forehead that speaks of aristocratic sorcerous lineage. His skin is pale olive-gold — lighter than most characters, with an almost translucent quality where the sorcerous energy beneath shows through as faint violet veins at his temples and along his neck. The skin is smooth, young, unmarked — the face of a sorcerer who has never needed to be close enough to be hit.

His eyes are striking — identical amber-gold irises that glow with sorcerous energy, currently blazing bright as power channels through him. The amber seems liquid, shifting, with dark flecks that move within the iris like sparks in molten metal. His gaze is focused, precise, analytical — he calculates trajectories and energy dispersal even mid-combat. Sharp catchlights blazing with violet reflection. His lashes are dark and straight, his brows thin and arched — the permanent expression of aristocratic disdain.

His nose is straight, narrow, sharp — almost blade-like in profile. His lips are thin, pale, curved in a slight, cold smile — the expression of someone who enjoys the mathematical beauty of destruction. His expression is cold superiority — the certainty that he is the most powerful person in any room and the mild amusement of proving it.

HAIR — SORCERER'S PRECISION:

Black, straight, and precisely styled — swept back from his forehead and held in place by a thin circlet of dark iron bearing a small violet gemstone at the center. The hair is shoulder-length, sleek, and moves with the magical winds his power generates. Each strand catches violet and acid-green light in sharp highlights. His hair is identical to his twin's — a visual marker of their bond.

CLOTHING — DOMINION SORCERER'S ROBES:

Savren wears the robes of a Dominion battle-sorcerer — layered dark fabric in charcoal and deep violet, fitted at the torso and flowing from the waist. The outer robe is embroidered with sorcerous circuit-patterns in dark silver thread — functional enchantments that channel and amplify his power. The sleeves are wide, whipping in the magical wind, revealing fitted dark gloves that crackle with residual energy. A heavy belt of dark leather bearing the Ashvanar family sigil — twin serpents coiled around a lightning bolt — secures the robes. Dark boots, dark everything — a man dressed for war from a family that has waged it for generations.

BACKGROUND — THE FORTRESS ASHFALL BATTLEMENTS:

Behind Savren and slightly out of focus, the massive dark battlements of Fortress Ashfall — the Dominion stronghold where the alliance suffered its greatest defeat. Dark stone walls rising into a sky heavy with ash and storm clouds. Violet-black lightning arcs between the fortress towers — sorcerous defense systems that Savren commands. Below the battlements, the distant shapes of the alliance's army can be seen — small, struggling, retreating. The fortress radiates dark power — every stone saturated with generations of Ashvanar sorcery.

ATMOSPHERIC EFFECTS:

Violet-black lightning and acid-green energy dominate the lighting — harsh, crackling, unstable. Magical wind whips through the scene, carrying debris and ash. The air itself seems charged — visible distortion around Savren's hands where reality bends under the pressure of his power. Dark storm clouds churn overhead. The overall effect is devastating, controlled destruction — a sorcerer at the peak of his power, moments before he is cut down.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT:

Savren's face must be positioned entirely BELOW the text area and ABOVE the quote at the bottom. His face occupies roughly the 55%-82% vertical zone. The top 40% must contain ONLY background elements. NO part of his face, hair, or body may enter the top 35%.
