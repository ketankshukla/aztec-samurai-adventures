SUBJECT — MAD GRIEF PORTRAIT (THE SURVIVING TWIN):

A lean man of Eastern-Mesoamerican descent in his late 20s — Gravos, the surviving Ashvanar twin — positioned in the lower-center of the image, face centered at approximately 60-75% down from the top. He is captured in a moment of unhinged, grief-fueled destruction — one arm raised skyward channeling a massive, unstable column of violet-black sorcerous energy that spirals wildly out of control, the other arm extended forward blasting a chaotic wave of acid-green corrosion at an unseen enemy. His body is wracked with the effort — muscles straining, veins visible at his temples, his face contorted in a scream of rage and grief. His power is greater than his twin's ever was. His control is shattered. He is a weapon without a safety, and he does not care who gets caught in the blast.

FACE — HYPER-DETAILED PHOTOREALISTIC MADNESS:

Gravos's face is identical to Savren's in bone structure — the same sharp cheekbones, narrow jaw, pointed chin, high forehead. But grief has ravaged what was once pristine. His skin is the same pale olive-gold but now sallow, sunken, with dark hollows beneath his eyes that speak of sleepless nights and screaming grief. The violet sorcerous veins at his temples are more prominent than Savren's — thicker, darker, pulsing visibly, as though his power is literally consuming him from within. His cheeks are gaunt — he has stopped eating properly since his twin died. A fresh scar runs across his left cheek — self-inflicted in a moment of grief, a mirror of the wound that killed his brother.

His eyes are the most disturbing change — the same amber-gold irises as Savren's but now burning with an unstable, flickering intensity. The amber is shot through with jagged veins of violet-black — his sorcery bleeding into his physical form, corruption visible in his gaze. His pupils are dilated unevenly — one larger than the other, a sign of the mental fracture that grief has caused. These are not calculating eyes anymore. These are the eyes of a man who has lost the only person who made him human and has decided to burn the world down as a funeral pyre. Tears streak his face — real tears, hot and angry, cutting tracks through the soot and magical residue on his skin. He is weeping and destroying simultaneously.

His mouth is open in a raw scream — teeth bared, lips pulled back, the tendons of his neck standing out in sharp relief. This is not a battle cry. This is the sound of a soul breaking. His expression is pure, unfiltered anguish weaponized as destruction — the most emotionally raw villain portrait in the series.

HAIR — UNRAVELED:

Identical to Savren's in color and type — black, straight, shoulder-length — but completely wild. The iron circlet is gone — lost or discarded. His hair whips in every direction, caught in the chaotic magical winds his uncontrolled power generates. Some strands are singed, others streaked with white where sorcerous backlash has burned the pigment. The precise styling is gone. Everything precise is gone.

CLOTHING — BATTLE-RAVAGED SORCERER:

The same Dominion sorcerer's robes as Savren's but destroyed — torn, burned, hanging in strips. The sorcerous circuit-embroidery is overloaded — the silver threads glowing bright violet, some melted, some still sparking with uncontrolled energy. The Ashvanar family belt is intact — the twin serpent sigil now a reminder of what was lost rather than what was shared. His hands are bare — the gloves burned away — and the skin of his hands is visibly damaged, cracked and bleeding violet light from within where raw power has split the flesh. He has stopped protecting himself. Protection implies wanting to survive.

BACKGROUND — THE SORCERY TOWER IN COLLAPSE:

Behind Gravos and slightly out of focus, the sorcery tower he has fortified in the Dominion capital — now overloading with his unstable power. The tower's stone walls crack with violet energy bleeding through every fissure. The structure is moments from catastrophic failure — a suicide weapon that could level a city block. Dark stone architecture warps and bends under sorcerous pressure. Lightning arcs between the tower's upper reaches. Below, distant figures flee — soldiers from both sides running from the detonation radius.

ATMOSPHERIC EFFECTS:

Chaotic, unstable magical energy dominates — violet-black and acid-green light pulsing erratically, casting shifting shadows that move too fast. Reality distortion is visible — the air around Gravos bends and warps, objects in his proximity appearing stretched or compressed. Debris floats in anti-gravity pockets. The air crackles with ozone and the metallic taste of overloaded sorcery. The overall effect is magnificent, terrifying instability — power without purpose, grief without limit.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT:

Gravos's face must be positioned entirely BELOW the text area and ABOVE the quote at the bottom. His face occupies roughly the 55%-82% vertical zone. The top 40% must contain ONLY background elements. NO part of his face, hair, or body may enter the top 35%.

TEXT — MUST BE RENDERED EXACTLY AS SPECIFIED:

All text is centered horizontally. All percentages measured from the TOP of the image.

Line 2 (exactly 8-16% from top): "GRAVOS" — very large, bold Trajan Pro font, gold color (#FFD700) with unstable violet-crackling edge glow and subtle embossed quality. Dominant text element. Letter-spacing 0.15em. Approximately 72-80pt equivalent.

Line 5 (exactly 24% from top): "Driven Mad by Grief · Sorcery Uncontrolled" — small italic Trajan Pro, light cream/violet. Approximately 12pt equivalent.

Decorative ornamental line (exactly 26% from top): Gold and violet ornamental filigree divider — Aztec-inspired geometric scrollwork but visibly damaged, cracking, with the twin-serpent motif broken — one serpent intact, the other shattered. Gold (#FFD700) with violet accents bleeding into crimson.

Line 6 (exactly 92% from top): "BROTHER!" — bold Trajan Pro font, centered, cream/white with harsh violet-crimson glow, enclosed in elegant quotation marks. Approximately 20pt equivalent. Raw. Anguished.

OVERALL MOOD AND QUALITY:

Devastating, unhinged, tragically beautiful — the feeling of watching grief become a weapon of mass destruction. Dominant palette: unstable violet-black, acid-green, sallow gold, and the harsh white of overloaded energy. Gravos must evoke pity beneath the terror — the same face as his controlled twin, now shattered by loss. The most emotionally raw villain in the series.

ABSOLUTELY NO oil painting texture. NO watercolor. NO canvas grain. NO painterly edges. PHOTOREALISTIC CINEMATIC DIGITAL ART — sharp, clean, precise, and devastatingly beautiful.
