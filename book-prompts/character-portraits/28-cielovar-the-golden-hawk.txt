---

A breathtaking ultra-high-resolution photorealistic character portrait rendered at 1600x2400 pixels, 300 DPI, in sharp cinematic digital style with advanced volumetric lighting, ray-traced reflections, and subsurface skin scattering. This must look like a $200-million Hollywood movie poster — every surface, every texture, every particle of light rendered with obsessive photographic precision. ABSOLUTELY NO oil painting, NO watercolor, NO painterly brushstrokes, NO soft-focus artistic filters, NO traditional media aesthetic whatsoever. Every pixel must be razor-sharp, hyper-detailed, and cinematically lit.

SUBJECT — MAJESTIC RAPTOR PORTRAIT (THE GOLDEN HAWK):

Cielovar, the golden war-hawk — Skyren's bonded mount and the most magnificent creature in the series — positioned in the lower-center of the image, head centered at approximately 55-75% down from the top. The hawk is captured in a moment of imperial stillness — perched on a massive stone outcropping at the edge of a cliff, wings partially spread in a threat display that spans the width of the image, head turned three-quarters toward the viewer with one enormous golden eye locked directly at the camera. The hawk is MASSIVE — twenty-foot wingspan, a body the size of a war-horse, built for speed, power, and aerial supremacy. Every feather, every talon, every curve of that lethal beak is rendered with obsessive photorealistic precision. This is the apex predator of the sky, and it knows it.

THE HAWK — OBSESSIVE PHOTOREALISTIC DETAIL:

Cielovar's plumage is the centerpiece — rendered with barbule-level photorealistic detail that rivals the finest wildlife photography. The primary feathers of the wings are deep brown-black — rich, glossy, with subtle barred patterns of cream and dark rust visible on each individual feather. The secondary feathers transition to a warmer tawny-brown. The mantle — the broad expanse across the shoulders and upper back — is the hawk's namesake: rich, burnished gold that catches sunlight and blazes like polished metal. Each mantle feather overlaps precisely, the golden color shifting between warm amber, bright gold, and deep copper depending on the angle of light. The breast is cream-white with bold brown streaking — each streak a precisely rendered marking.

The hawk's head is magnificent — covered in short, tight feathers of deep brown with a golden crown that catches the light. The beak is enormous, curved, sharp — dark horn at the tip transitioning to golden-yellow at the base, polished to a lethal sheen. The cere (the fleshy base of the beak) is bright yellow. The hawk's visible eye is extraordinary — large, round, and a stunning golden-amber that exactly matches Skyren's own eyes. The iris is complex — layers of molten gold, burnt amber, and dark rings, with a pupil contracted to a sharp pinpoint in the bright light. The eye is focused, intelligent, and burning with predatory awareness. This is not a mindless animal — this is a sentient partner, a warrior in its own right.

The talons are visible gripping the stone outcropping — enormous, black, curved like scimitars, each one individually rendered with photorealistic texture. The talons dig into the stone, leaving visible scratch marks. The legs are thick, powerful, covered in scaled yellow-grey skin with visible individual scales. A leather jess (training strap) hangs from one leg — worn, well-used, the mark of the bond between rider and hawk.

The partially spread wings create a dramatic frame — primary feathers fanned out, each one distinct, the leading edges sharp and aerodynamic. Sunlight streams through the thinner portions of the wing membrane, creating a translucent golden glow — backlighting the feather structure in breathtaking detail.

BACKGROUND — HIGH MOUNTAIN CLIFF AT GOLDEN HOUR:

Behind Cielovar and slightly out of focus, a vast mountain landscape at golden hour — jagged peaks stretching to the horizon, valleys filled with golden mist, the sun sitting low and pouring liquid amber light across every surface. The cliff edge where the hawk perches overlooks a thousand-foot drop into a forested valley below. Other hawks — smaller, wild, distant — wheel in the thermals rising from the valley, their silhouettes dark against the golden sky. Towering cumulus clouds catch the golden hour light, their upper reaches blazing white-gold against a deepening blue sky. The sense of altitude and freedom is overwhelming.

ATMOSPHERIC EFFECTS:

Brilliant golden-hour light creates warm, dramatic illumination across every surface — the hawk's golden mantle feathers blazing like actual gold, the stone outcropping warm amber, the mountain peaks catching fire. Wind is visible in subtle movements — a few loose downy feathers drifting from the hawk's breast, the trailing edges of the primary feathers ruffling slightly. Fine golden dust motes hang in the light. The air is crystalline-clear — high-altitude visibility rendering distant peaks in sharp detail. The overall effect is majestic, wild, and free — the king of the sky in its natural domain.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — HEAD PLACEMENT:

Cielovar's head must be positioned entirely BELOW the text area and ABOVE the bottom of the image. The hawk's head occupies roughly the 50%-72% vertical zone, with wings extending wider. The top 35% of the image must contain ONLY background elements — sky, clouds, mountain peaks. NO part of the hawk's head, beak, or wing-tips may enter the top 30%.

TEXT — MUST BE RENDERED EXACTLY AS SPECIFIED:

All text is centered horizontally. All percentages measured from the TOP of the image.

Line 1 (exactly 3% from top): "AZTEC SAMURAI ADVENTURES" — small elegant Trajan Pro font, turquoise color (#40E0D0), letter-spacing 0.15em, approximately 14pt equivalent. Subtle turquoise glow.

Line 2 (exactly 8-16% from top): "CIELOVAR" — very large, bold Trajan Pro font, gold color (#FFD700) with warm golden glow and subtle embossed quality. Dominant text element. Letter-spacing 0.12em. Approximately 64-72pt equivalent.

Line 3 (exactly 18% from top): "The Golden Hawk" — medium Trajan Pro font, white/cream with warm golden tones. Letter-spacing 0.1em. Approximately 24pt equivalent.

Line 4 (exactly 21% from top): "Skyren's Bonded War-Hawk" — smaller Trajan Pro font, turquoise-gold color. Letter-spacing 0.1em. Approximately 16pt equivalent.

Line 5 (exactly 24% from top): "Near-Telepathic Bond · Outflies Everything · Wings of Gold and Fire" — small italic Trajan Pro, light cream/gold. Approximately 12pt equivalent.

Decorative ornamental line (exactly 26% from top): Elegant gold and turquoise ornamental filigree divider — Aztec-inspired geometric scrollwork with feather, wing, and talon motifs. Gold (#FFD700) with turquoise (#40E0D0) accents.

OVERALL MOOD AND QUALITY:

Majestic, wild, awe-inspiring — the feeling of looking into the eye of a creature that was born to rule the sky. Dominant palette: burnished gold, warm amber, deep brown, and high-altitude blue. Cielovar must be the most photorealistically detailed subject in the entire portrait series — every feather a masterwork, every scale precise, every highlight accurate. This is not a fantasy creature — this is a real animal, magnificently scaled up, rendered with the reverence of the finest wildlife art.

ABSOLUTELY NO oil painting texture. NO watercolor. NO canvas grain. NO painterly edges. PHOTOREALISTIC CINEMATIC DIGITAL ART — sharp, clean, precise, and devastatingly beautiful.
