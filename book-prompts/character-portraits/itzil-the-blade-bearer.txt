CHARACTER: ITZIL — THE BLADE-BEARER
TYPE: Character Portrait (Social Media / Website / Marketing)
FORMATS: Instagram Square (1080x1080), Portrait (1080x1350)

===================================================================
FORMAT A: INSTAGRAM SQUARE (1080 x 1080 pixels, 72-300 DPI, sRGB)
===================================================================

A cinematic photorealistic character portrait rendered at 1080x1080 pixels with razor-sharp digital precision, advanced volumetric lighting, and ray-traced reflections. ABSOLUTELY NO oil painting, NO watercolor, NO painterly texture. This must look like a still from a $200-million Hollywood fantasy epic — every surface, every texture, every particle of light photographic in quality.

SUBJECT — ITZIL, COMMANDER OF THE ALLIANCE:

A breathtakingly gorgeous young woman of indigenous Mesoamerican descent in her early 20s, captured from the chest up in a powerful three-quarter portrait. She faces the viewer with her chin slightly raised — not arrogance, but unshakable resolve. Her jade-obsidian katana rests against her right shoulder, the blade erupting with golden sunfire that casts warm amber light across her face, neck, and armor. Her left hand is visible at chest level, fingers slightly open, turquoise energy crackling faintly between them like caged lightning. Her expression is the cover's emotional anchor: steady, fierce, hauntingly beautiful — the serene certainty of a woman who has already decided she will not lose.

FACE — HYPER-DETAILED:

High sculpted cheekbones catching golden light like polished bronze. Deep obsidian-black eyes shot through with golden amber striations that glow with inner fire. Thick dark lashes casting crescent shadows on her upper cheekbones. Full terracotta-rose lips parted just enough to show quiet, controlled breath. A small crescent-shaped scar at her left collarbone — pale against bronze skin. Warrior braids threaded with turquoise beads, gold rings, and obsidian pins, with loosened strands whipping in magical wind. A magnificent quetzal-feather crest pinned to her left shoulder — iridescent emerald and deep sapphire, with scarlet macaw feather accents.

ARMOR — MESOAMERICAN-SAMURAI FUSION:

Obsidian-flecked lacquered chest plates with gold filigree sun-disc patterns. Jade-green lacquered vambraces over wrapped linen. Deep burgundy and jade textile underlayers with geometric jaguar and serpent motifs. Broad obsidian-black silk sash knotted at her left hip.

BACKGROUND — CINEMATIC ATMOSPHERIC:

Behind her, soft-focused (cinematic bokeh): the Sun-Blade temple courtyard at golden hour — massive carved stone columns, stepped pyramids, golden light streaming through in horizontal shafts. Turquoise mystical energy shimmers in the upper atmosphere. Golden embers and turquoise particles drift throughout the scene.

TEXT (rendered on the image — ALL TEXT MUST APPEAR ABOVE THE CHARACTER'S HEAD in the top 35% of the frame):

Line 1: "AZTEC SAMURAI ADVENTURES" — small Trajan Pro, turquoise (#40E0D0), letter-spacing 0.15em. Subtle glow.

Line 2: [small vertical gap]

Line 3: "ITZIL" — VERY LARGE bold Trajan Pro, white/cream with golden warmth and subtle embossed quality. This is the DOMINANT text element — it must command the frame. Approximately 80pt equivalent.

Line 4: "THE BLADE-BEARER" — medium Trajan Pro, gold (#FFD700), letter-spacing 0.15em.

Line 5: [small vertical gap]

Line 6: "Commander of the Alliance" — small italic Trajan Pro, cream/gold.
Line 7: "Reluctant Prophet · Warrior of the Sun-Blade Order" — small Trajan Pro, turquoise (#40E0D0).

Line 8: [small vertical gap]

Line 9: "\"I must be present, not perfect.\"" — small italic Trajan Pro, cream with subtle golden glow. This is Itzil's defining quote.

All text centered horizontally, positioned in the top 30-35% of the image against the darker sky/atmospheric areas above the character's head for maximum readability. All text with subtle dark drop shadow for legibility.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — TEXT ABOVE HEAD:

ALL text must be rendered in the top 35% of the image. The character's head begins no higher than 38% from the top. The space between the bottom of the text block and the top of the character's head should feel comfortable — not cramped, not distant. The character's face should be roughly centered vertically in the remaining 60% of the image (approximately 50-70% from top).

MOOD: Epic, intimate, commanding. A warrior goddess in golden firelight — the woman who carries the blade that carries the light. Warm amber and cool turquoise in dramatic chiaroscuro. Designed to stop a scrolling thumb and make the viewer say "Who IS she?"

ABSOLUTELY NO oil painting, NO watercolor, NO canvas grain. PHOTOREALISTIC CINEMATIC DIGITAL ART — sharp, clean, precise, and devastatingly beautiful.

===================================================================
FORMAT B: PORTRAIT (1080 x 1350 pixels, 72-300 DPI, sRGB)
===================================================================

Same subject, armor, face detail, and atmospheric elements as Format A, but recomposed for the taller portrait ratio. The additional vertical space allows for:

- More atmospheric sky and temple architecture above the text block
- The character visible from the waist up instead of chest up
- The Sun-Blade more fully visible along her right side, the golden fire stretching upward into the text zone as a luminous accent (but NOT obscuring the text)
- More dramatic depth in the background temple architecture

TEXT layout identical to Format A, positioned in the top 30% of the taller frame. Character's head begins at approximately 33% from top.

MOOD: Same epic intimacy, but with more breathing room — a full hero portrait suitable for a movie character poster.
