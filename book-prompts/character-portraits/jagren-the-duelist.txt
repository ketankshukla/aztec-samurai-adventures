===================================================================
FORMAT A: INSTAGRAM SQUARE (1080 x 1080 pixels, 72-300 DPI, sRGB)
===================================================================

A cinematic photorealistic character portrait rendered at 1080x1080 pixels with razor-sharp digital precision, advanced volumetric lighting, and ray-traced reflections. ABSOLUTELY NO oil painting, NO watercolor, NO painterly texture. This must look like a still from a $200-million Hollywood fantasy epic — every surface, every texture, every particle of light photographic in quality.

SUBJECT — JAGREN, DUELIST OF THE ALLIANCE:

A strikingly handsome young man of indigenous Mesoamerican descent in his early 20s, captured from the chest up in a confident, confrontational portrait. He faces the viewer almost head-on, chin tilted slightly down, looking up through dark lashes — the pose of a born showman who knows exactly how magnetic he is. His right hand grips the hilt of a long dueling rapier — a weapon of elegant Mesoamerican-forged steel with an obsidian-wire-wrapped grip — held diagonally across his chest, the polished blade catching crimson and gold light in a razor-sharp line. His left hand is open at his side, fingers splayed with casual confidence. His expression walks the knife-edge between cocky bravado and something deeper — the haunted awareness of a man who sought glory and found horror instead.

FACE — HYPER-DETAILED:

Classically handsome with an almost theatrical beauty — the kind of face that filled arenas. Strong, symmetrical bone structure with prominent cheekbones, a sharp aristocratic nose, and a jaw that could cut glass. His warm bronze skin is flawless except for a dramatic new scar — a ragged diagonal slash from his right temple across the bridge of his nose to his left cheek, still slightly pink, earned at Fortress Ashfall. The scar transforms his pretty-boy face into something far more compelling. His eyes are dark amber-brown, large and expressive, framed by long dark lashes — eyes that once sparkled with arena showmanship and now carry the weight of watching hundreds die. There is still fire in them — but it is controlled fire, tempered by grief. His lips are full, slightly parted in what could be a smirk or a challenge. His eyebrows are elegantly arched — one slightly raised, perpetually questioning.

HAIR — ARENA WARRIOR STYLE:

His hair is raven-black, longer than Kaelen's but worn in a dramatic warrior's style — the sides braided tight against his skull in three precise cornrow braids, the top swept back in a loose mane that falls to his shoulders. Gold clasps hold the braids at intervals — the only vanity he hasn't shed. Several strands have escaped, framing his scarred face with artful wildness. A single scarlet feather is braided into the left temple braid — his arena token, the one thing he kept from the life before.

ARMOR AND CLOTHING — ARENA MEETS BATTLEFIELD:

He wears duelist's armor — lighter and more flamboyant than standard infantry, designed for speed and visibility. A fitted crimson-and-obsidian cuirass with gold-inlaid geometric patterns — stepped pyramids and jaguar motifs — protects his torso. The armor is scratched and battle-worn now, the gold dulled, a deep gouge across the left shoulder plate. Beneath the cuirass, a black silk combat shirt with sleeves rolled to the elbows reveals corded forearms wrapped in thin leather strips. A crimson sash at his waist — his arena colors — is frayed at the edges. His dueling rapier's scabbard hangs at his left hip, the scabbard itself an artwork of carved obsidian and gold.

BACKGROUND — CINEMATIC ATMOSPHERIC:

Behind him, soft-focused (cinematic bokeh): the smoking ruins of Fortress Ashfall at dusk — broken stone battlements silhouetted against a blood-red sunset, embers rising in thick columns, the distant glow of fires still burning. Crimson and amber light floods the scene from the dying sun, casting his face in dramatic warm-toned side-lighting. Faint turquoise particles drift through the ash-laden air.

TEXT (rendered on the image — ALL TEXT MUST APPEAR ABOVE THE CHARACTER'S HEAD in the top 35% of the frame):

Line 1: "AZTEC SAMURAI ADVENTURES" — small Trajan Pro, turquoise (#40E0D0), letter-spacing 0.15em. Subtle glow.

Line 2: [small vertical gap]

Line 3: "JAGREN" — VERY LARGE bold Trajan Pro, white/cream with warm golden-crimson warmth and subtle embossed quality. This is the DOMINANT text element — it must command the frame. Approximately 80pt equivalent.

Line 4: "THE DUELIST" — medium Trajan Pro, gold (#FFD700), letter-spacing 0.15em.

Line 5: [small vertical gap]

Line 6: "Frontline Champion of the Alliance" — small italic Trajan Pro, cream/gold.
Line 7: "Glory-Seeker Turned Scarred Veteran · Arena Legend" — small Trajan Pro, turquoise (#40E0D0).

Line 8: [small vertical gap]

Line 9: "\"Glory is a lie the living tell about the dead.\"" — small italic Trajan Pro, cream with subtle crimson glow. This is Jagren's defining quote.

All text centered horizontally, positioned in the top 30-35% of the image against the darker smoke/sky areas above the character's head for maximum readability. All text with subtle dark drop shadow for legibility.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — TEXT ABOVE HEAD:

ALL text must be rendered in the top 35% of the image. The character's head begins no higher than 38% from the top. The space between the bottom of the text block and the top of the character's head should feel comfortable — not cramped, not distant. The character's face should be roughly centered vertically in the remaining 60% of the image (approximately 50-70% from top).

MOOD: Fierce, wounded, magnetic. A fallen arena champion standing in the ashes of his glory — beautiful and broken and rebuilding. Crimson and amber dominate. Designed to evoke sympathy and admiration in equal measure.

ABSOLUTELY NO oil painting, NO watercolor, NO canvas grain. PHOTOREALISTIC CINEMATIC DIGITAL ART — sharp, clean, precise, and devastatingly beautiful.

===================================================================
FORMAT B: PORTRAIT (1080 x 1350 pixels, 72-300 DPI, sRGB)
===================================================================

Same subject, clothing, face detail, and atmospheric elements as Format A, but recomposed for the taller portrait ratio. The additional vertical space allows for:

- More atmospheric smoke-filled sky and fortress ruins above the text block
- The character visible from the waist up — revealing the full crimson sash, the rapier scabbard, and the battle-worn cuirass
- The dueling rapier more fully visible, its blade catching light in a dramatic diagonal line
- More dramatic depth in the ruined fortress background

TEXT layout identical to Format A, positioned in the top 30% of the taller frame. Character's head begins at approximately 33% from top.

MOOD: Same fierce magnetism, but with more cinematic grandeur — a warrior portrait suitable for a gladiator movie character poster.
