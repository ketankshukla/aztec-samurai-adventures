===================================================================
FORMAT A: INSTAGRAM SQUARE (1080 x 1080 pixels, 72-300 DPI, sRGB)
===================================================================

A cinematic photorealistic character portrait rendered at 1080x1080 pixels with razor-sharp digital precision, advanced volumetric lighting, and ray-traced reflections. ABSOLUTELY NO oil painting, NO watercolor, NO painterly texture. This must look like a still from a $200-million Hollywood fantasy epic — every surface, every texture, every particle of light photographic in quality.

SUBJECT — KAELEN, SCOUT OF THE ALLIANCE:

A devastatingly handsome young man of indigenous Mesoamerican descent in his mid-20s, captured from the chest up in a tense, coiled three-quarter portrait. He is half-turned from the viewer, as though caught mid-glance over his shoulder — the pose of a man who lives in the spaces between shadows. His face is angled toward the camera with a sharp, assessing gaze — the look of someone who has already mapped every exit in the room. His right hand is raised near his collarbone, fingers loosely curled around a thin obsidian throwing blade, its edge catching a sliver of turquoise moonlight. Faint shadow-step energy clings to his silhouette — wisps of dark indigo smoke that dissolve at the edges, as though he is perpetually half-phasing between solid and shadow.

FACE — HYPER-DETAILED:

Sharp, angular bone structure — high cheekbones with hollows beneath that catch dramatic shadow, a strong square jaw with a day's stubble rendered hair by hair, and a chin that speaks of stubbornness refined into discipline. His warm bronze skin is weathered just enough to tell a story — a faint scar bisecting his left eyebrow (a Dominion blade), another thin pale line along his right jawline. His eyes are his most striking feature — dark obsidian-brown, sharp and intelligent, with an intensity that borders on unsettling. In the turquoise light, his irises show flecks of deep amber. There is humor buried deep in those eyes — bitter, self-aware, the humor of a man who has seen his entire unit die and decided to keep going anyway. Two precise catchlights give his eyes extraordinary depth. His eyebrows are strong, slightly furrowed — perpetual alertness. His lips are firm, set in a slight sardonic half-smile — the expression of a man who finds the universe darkly amusing. His nose is straight with a slight crook from a past break — it adds character, not imperfection.

HAIR — TACTICAL AND WIND-SWEPT:

His hair is jet-black, shorter than Itzil's — cut for practicality, not ceremony. The sides are closely cropped, the top longer and swept back, with several loose strands falling across his forehead. No braids, no ornamentation — function over form. A thin leather cord ties a small obsidian bead behind his left ear — his only personal token. In the wind, his hair moves with sharp, clean lines — not wild, but restless.

CLOTHING AND GEAR — SHADOW OPERATIVE:

He wears lightweight scout armor designed for silence and speed — dark charcoal-grey leather over black textile layers. The leather is supple, well-worn, with a matte finish that absorbs light rather than reflecting it. A short hooded cloak of deep midnight-blue hangs from his left shoulder — the fabric treated with shadow-step residue, its edges seeming to blur into the darkness around him. Across his chest, a bandolier of thin obsidian throwing blades in individual sheaths — each blade unique, hand-ground, deadly. His vambraces are slim dark leather reinforced with thin obsidian plates — no gold, no jade, no ornamentation. Everything is built to disappear. A coiled grappling line hangs at his left hip.

BACKGROUND — CINEMATIC ATMOSPHERIC:

Behind him, soft-focused (cinematic bokeh): a moonlit jungle canopy at the edge of a Dominion encampment — distant amber firelight from enemy campfires creating warm pools of orange between the silver-blue shadows of massive ceiba trees. Turquoise shadow-step particles drift in the air around him like luminous dust motes, giving the darkness a magical quality. Faint mist curls at the lower edge of the frame.

TEXT (rendered on the image — ALL TEXT MUST APPEAR ABOVE THE CHARACTER'S HEAD in the top 35% of the frame):

Line 1: "AZTEC SAMURAI ADVENTURES" — small Trajan Pro, turquoise (#40E0D0), letter-spacing 0.15em. Subtle glow.

Line 2: [small vertical gap]

Line 3: "KAELEN" — VERY LARGE bold Trajan Pro, white/cream with cool silver-blue tones and subtle embossed quality. This is the DOMINANT text element — it must command the frame. Approximately 80pt equivalent.

Line 4: "THE SHADOW SCOUT" — medium Trajan Pro, gold (#FFD700), letter-spacing 0.15em.

Line 5: [small vertical gap]

Line 6: "Scout & Tactician of the Alliance" — small italic Trajan Pro, cream/gold.
Line 7: "Lone Wolf Reforged · Master of the Shadow-Step" — small Trajan Pro, turquoise (#40E0D0).

Line 8: [small vertical gap]

Line 9: "\"Don't make it weird.\"" — small italic Trajan Pro, cream with subtle silver glow. This is Kaelen's defining quote.

All text centered horizontally, positioned in the top 30-35% of the image against the darker sky/canopy areas above the character's head for maximum readability. All text with subtle dark drop shadow for legibility.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — TEXT ABOVE HEAD:

ALL text must be rendered in the top 35% of the image. The character's head begins no higher than 38% from the top. The space between the bottom of the text block and the top of the character's head should feel comfortable — not cramped, not distant. The character's face should be roughly centered vertically in the remaining 60% of the image (approximately 50-70% from top).

MOOD: Tense, magnetic, dangerous. A shadow operative caught between moonlight and firelight — the man who walks where no one else dares. Cool silver-blue and warm amber in sharp contrast. Designed to intrigue — the viewer wants to know his story.

ABSOLUTELY NO oil painting, NO watercolor, NO canvas grain. PHOTOREALISTIC CINEMATIC DIGITAL ART — sharp, clean, precise, and devastatingly atmospheric.

===================================================================
FORMAT B: PORTRAIT (1080 x 1350 pixels, 72-300 DPI, sRGB)
===================================================================

Same subject, clothing, face detail, and atmospheric elements as Format A, but recomposed for the taller portrait ratio. The additional vertical space allows for:

- More atmospheric jungle canopy and moonlit sky above the text block
- The character visible from the waist up instead of chest up — revealing the full bandolier, the hooded cloak, and the grappling line at his hip
- More dramatic depth in the background — the Dominion encampment fires visible through layers of jungle mist
- Shadow-step wisps more visible along his full silhouette

TEXT layout identical to Format A, positioned in the top 30% of the taller frame. Character's head begins at approximately 33% from top.

MOOD: Same tense magnetism, but with more cinematic scope — a spy portrait suitable for a thriller movie character poster.
