===================================================================
FORMAT A: INSTAGRAM SQUARE (1080 x 1080 pixels, 72-300 DPI, sRGB)
===================================================================

A cinematic photorealistic character portrait rendered at 1080x1080 pixels with razor-sharp digital precision, advanced volumetric lighting, and ray-traced reflections. ABSOLUTELY NO oil painting, NO watercolor, NO painterly texture. This must look like a still from a $200-million Hollywood fantasy epic — every surface, every texture, every particle of light photographic in quality.

SUBJECT — KORVAIN, LAST GRANDMASTER OF THE SUN-BLADE ORDER:

A magnificent elderly man of indigenous Mesoamerican descent in his late 60s, captured from the chest up in a portrait of immense dignity, fading power, and unshakable wisdom. He faces the viewer with a calm, direct gaze — the eyes of a man who has trained warriors, led armies, buried students, and made peace with his own mortality. His presence fills the frame despite his age. In his right hand, held vertically before his chest in a traditional salute position, is an ancient Sun-Blade — not Itzil's, but the original grandmaster's blade, older and more weathered, its golden light dimmer but steadier, a controlled ember rather than a blaze. The blade's light casts warm amber illumination upward across his lined face, revealing every crease and scar with cinematic clarity. His left hand rests on his hip — relaxed, authoritative, the posture of a man who no longer needs to prove anything to anyone.

FACE — HYPER-DETAILED:

A face of extraordinary character — every line tells a story. Broad, strong bone structure that was once formidable — wide cheekbones, a prominent jaw now slightly softened with age but still commanding. His warm bronze skin is deeply lined — crow's feet radiating from his eyes like sunbursts, deep furrows across his forehead from decades of worry, laugh lines that speak of a man who once smiled easily and now smiles with purpose. His eyes are the anchor — deep brown, clear despite his age, radiating warmth, intelligence, and a profound, bone-deep kindness that makes the viewer want to sit at his feet and listen. There is sadness in those eyes too — the sadness of a man who has outlived most of his students and knows he will not outlive this war. His eyebrows are thick, wild, shot through with silver — the one part of his grooming he has given up controlling. His nose is broad and slightly bulbous at the tip — a nose that has been broken and reset multiple times across a lifetime of combat. His lips are thin, often curved in a slight, knowing smile — the smile of a man who has seen the worst and still believes in the best.

HAIR — ELDER WARRIOR:

His hair is magnificent — a full mane of silver-white, long and flowing, worn loose past his shoulders. It was once jet-black (a few dark strands remain near his ears) and is now almost entirely silver, catching the Sun-Blade's golden light like polished metal. It is thick for his age — a warrior's vitality. His beard is full, silver-white, trimmed to a rounded point, well-maintained — the beard of a leader who still takes care with his appearance. His hair moves slightly in a breeze that catches the Sun-Blade's energy field. A simple leather cord ties a small section of hair behind his left ear — a warrior's tie from his youth that he never removed.

CLOTHING AND GEAR — GRANDMASTER'S REGALIA:

He wears the ceremonial armor of the Sun-Blade Order's grandmaster — but worn, patched, and battle-scarred from a lifetime of service. The primary layer is an elaborate chest guard of ancient obsidian plates, similar to Itzil's but older — the gold filigree more intricate, more worn, the sun-disc pattern at the center larger and etched deeper by centuries of ritual polishing. A heavy mantle of deep golden-brown fabric drapes from both shoulders — embroidered with faded turquoise thread in patterns of suns, eagles, and celestial serpents. The mantle is clasped at the throat with a massive gold brooch in the shape of a blazing sun — the grandmaster's seal, dulled with age. Beneath the armor, traditional Mesoamerican warrior textiles in deep reds and golds — faded but dignified. His hands show his age — large, gnarled, with swollen knuckles and liver spots — but his grip on the blade is rock-steady.

BACKGROUND — CINEMATIC ATMOSPHERIC:

Behind him, soft-focused (cinematic bokeh): the inner sanctum of the Sun-Blade temple — the sacred training hall where generations of warriors were forged. Ancient stone walls carved with the names of every grandmaster, lit by the warm amber glow of eternal flame-bowls arranged in a circle. Shafts of golden light descend from high windows, creating pillars of illumination in the dusty air. The walls hold weapon racks of historical Sun-Blades — each one dim, their bearers long dead, but faintly acknowledging Korvain's presence with the slightest pulse of light. Golden motes and turquoise particles drift slowly through the shafts of light — the temple's ancient magic, still alive.

TEXT (rendered on the image — ALL TEXT MUST APPEAR ABOVE THE CHARACTER'S HEAD in the top 35% of the frame):

Line 1: "AZTEC SAMURAI ADVENTURES" — small Trajan Pro, turquoise (#40E0D0), letter-spacing 0.15em. Subtle glow.

Line 2: [small vertical gap]

Line 3: "KORVAIN" — VERY LARGE bold Trajan Pro, white/cream with deep golden warmth and subtle embossed quality. This is the DOMINANT text element — it must command the frame. Approximately 80pt equivalent.

Line 4: "THE GRANDMASTER" — medium Trajan Pro, gold (#FFD700), letter-spacing 0.15em.

Line 5: [small vertical gap]

Line 6: "Last Grandmaster of the Sun-Blade Order" — small italic Trajan Pro, cream/gold.
Line 7: "Itzil's Mentor · Guardian of the Ancient Ways" — small Trajan Pro, turquoise (#40E0D0).

Line 8: [small vertical gap]

Line 9: "\"The blade broke. Good. Now you know you don't need it. You never did.\"" — small italic Trajan Pro, cream with subtle golden glow. This is Korvain's defining quote.

All text centered horizontally, positioned in the top 30-35% of the image against the darker temple ceiling above the character's head for maximum readability. All text with subtle dark drop shadow for legibility.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — TEXT ABOVE HEAD:

ALL text must be rendered in the top 35% of the image. The character's head begins no higher than 38% from the top. The space between the bottom of the text block and the top of the character's head should feel comfortable — not cramped, not distant. The character's face should be roughly centered vertically in the remaining 60% of the image (approximately 50-70% from top).

MOOD: Noble, warm, bittersweet. The last grandmaster in the last light — a titan at twilight, magnificent and mortal. Deep gold and warm amber dominate. Designed to evoke reverence and grief — the viewer knows, somehow, that this man will not survive the story, and that makes every detail of his portrait more precious.

ABSOLUTELY NO oil painting, NO watercolor, NO canvas grain. PHOTOREALISTIC CINEMATIC DIGITAL ART — sharp, clean, precise, and profoundly moving.

===================================================================
FORMAT B: PORTRAIT (1080 x 1350 pixels, 72-300 DPI, sRGB)
===================================================================

Same subject, clothing, face detail, and atmospheric elements as Format A, but recomposed for the taller portrait ratio. The additional vertical space allows for:

- More atmospheric temple interior — the carved name-walls, the flame-bowls, the high windows with descending light shafts
- The character visible from the waist up — revealing the full grandmaster's mantle, the ceremonial armor, and the historical blade in full
- More dimly-glowing Sun-Blades visible on the weapon racks behind him
- Greater sense of sacred space and centuries of martial tradition

TEXT layout identical to Format A, positioned in the top 30% of the taller frame. Character's head begins at approximately 33% from top.

MOOD: Same noble warmth, but with more sacred grandeur — a grandmaster's portrait suitable for a legendary mentor character poster.
