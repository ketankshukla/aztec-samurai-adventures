===================================================================
FORMAT A: INSTAGRAM SQUARE (1080 x 1080 pixels, 72-300 DPI, sRGB)
===================================================================

A cinematic photorealistic character portrait rendered at 1080x1080 pixels with razor-sharp digital precision, advanced volumetric lighting, and ray-traced reflections. ABSOLUTELY NO oil painting, NO watercolor, NO painterly texture. This must look like a still from a $200-million Hollywood fantasy epic — every surface, every texture, every particle of light photographic in quality.

SUBJECT — RAINARA, WATER-MAGIC WARRIOR OF THE ALLIANCE:

A fiercely beautiful young woman of indigenous Mesoamerican descent in her mid-20s, captured from the chest up in a portrait of raw, elemental power. She faces the viewer at a slight angle, her expression one of controlled fury — jaw set, nostrils slightly flared, eyes blazing with the intensity of a woman who was caged and will never be caged again. Both hands are raised at shoulder height, fingers curved and tense — and between them, a swirling vortex of living water spirals and coils, defying gravity. The water catches light in impossible ways — turquoise and deep cerulean blue, with threads of bioluminescent white running through it like veins of lightning. Droplets orbit her hands in slow motion. Her hair and clothing are caught in the vortex's wind, adding dynamic energy to the portrait.

FACE — HYPER-DETAILED:

Striking, angular beauty with an edge of wildness — this is not a woman who was raised in temples or courts. High, sharp cheekbones that catch light like blades. A strong, defined jawline with a slightly pointed chin. Her warm bronze skin is darker than Itzil's — a deeper coppery tone that speaks of coastal heritage, sun, and sea. Faded scars circle both wrists — the marks of Dominion shackles, pale against her dark skin, never hidden, worn as testimony. Her eyes are extraordinary — deep sea-green, vivid against her dark skin, with flecks of turquoise that seem to shift and flow like water in sunlight. In the glow of her magic, her irises are luminous — almost otherworldly. Her gaze is direct, challenging, daring the viewer to look away. Her lips are full and expressive, set in a line that could become a snarl or a fierce grin in an instant. Her nose is strong and aquiline — proud, unapologetic.

HAIR — OCEAN-WILD:

Her hair is thick, jet-black, and worn in long, free-flowing waves that cascade past her shoulders — untamed, unbraided, moving with the water-magic wind like kelp in a current. It is threaded with small blue-green glass beads and tiny shells — coastal traditions — that catch the light with every movement. Some strands are wet, clinging to her neck and collarbone, adding to the elemental, just-emerged-from-the-sea quality. No warrior braids — Rainara's hair is her defiance against the Dominion who shaved it in captivity.

CLOTHING AND GEAR — COASTAL WARRIOR:

She wears light, fluid armor designed for a water-magic user — a fitted tunic of deep ocean-blue fabric with a shimmering, scale-like weave that catches light like fish scales. Over this, a breastplate of polished abalone shell segments — iridescent blue-green-purple, each segment individually shaped and layered like natural armor. The shell armor is reinforced with thin bands of dark steel at the edges. Her arms are bare from the biceps down — water-mages need skin contact with the elements. Thin bands of woven sea-grass wrap her forearms in spiral patterns, with small jade beads at each crossing point. A belt of woven dark leather holds a curved coral-handled knife at her right hip — her only traditional weapon.

BACKGROUND — CINEMATIC ATMOSPHERIC:

Behind her, soft-focused (cinematic bokeh): a dramatic ocean cliff at the edge of a storm — massive waves crashing against dark volcanic rock, sending up explosions of white spray. The sky is split — deep violet storm clouds on the left, breaking turquoise-blue sky on the right, with shafts of golden light piercing through the cloud break. The ocean itself seems to respond to her presence — the nearest wave curling unnaturally, reaching toward her. Salt mist and turquoise magical particles fill the air.

TEXT (rendered on the image — ALL TEXT MUST APPEAR ABOVE THE CHARACTER'S HEAD in the top 35% of the frame):

Line 1: "AZTEC SAMURAI ADVENTURES" — small Trajan Pro, turquoise (#40E0D0), letter-spacing 0.15em. Subtle glow.

Line 2: [small vertical gap]

Line 3: "RAINARA" — VERY LARGE bold Trajan Pro, white/cream with deep ocean-blue undertones and subtle embossed quality. This is the DOMINANT text element — it must command the frame. Approximately 80pt equivalent.

Line 4: "THE WATER WARRIOR" — medium Trajan Pro, gold (#FFD700), letter-spacing 0.15em.

Line 5: [small vertical gap]

Line 6: "Wielder of the Water-Knot" — small italic Trajan Pro, cream/gold.
Line 7: "Freed Captive · Protector of Rivers and Seas" — small Trajan Pro, turquoise (#40E0D0).

Line 8: [small vertical gap]

Line 9: "\"They chained the ocean. The ocean remembers.\"" — small italic Trajan Pro, cream with subtle deep blue glow. This is Rainara's defining quote.

All text centered horizontally, positioned in the top 30-35% of the image against the stormy sky above the character's head for maximum readability. All text with subtle dark drop shadow for legibility.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — TEXT ABOVE HEAD:

ALL text must be rendered in the top 35% of the image. The character's head begins no higher than 38% from the top. The space between the bottom of the text block and the top of the character's head should feel comfortable — not cramped, not distant. The character's face should be roughly centered vertically in the remaining 60% of the image (approximately 50-70% from top).

MOOD: Elemental, fierce, untameable. A woman of the ocean — raw power barely contained, fury channeled into purpose. Deep ocean blues and turquoise against storm-violet and golden breakthrough light. Designed to convey primal power — the viewer can almost feel the salt spray.

ABSOLUTELY NO oil painting, NO watercolor, NO canvas grain. PHOTOREALISTIC CINEMATIC DIGITAL ART — sharp, clean, precise, and elementally powerful.

===================================================================
FORMAT B: PORTRAIT (1080 x 1350 pixels, 72-300 DPI, sRGB)
===================================================================

Same subject, clothing, face detail, and atmospheric elements as Format A, but recomposed for the taller portrait ratio. The additional vertical space allows for:

- More dramatic stormy sky and crashing waves above the text block
- The character visible from the waist up — revealing the full abalone shell breastplate, the sea-grass wraps, and the coral-handled knife
- The water vortex more expansive, with larger orbiting droplets and more visible turquoise energy threads
- More dramatic ocean cliff and wave action in the background

TEXT layout identical to Format A, positioned in the top 30% of the taller frame. Character's head begins at approximately 33% from top.

MOOD: Same elemental fury, but with more environmental drama — a sea-warrior portrait suitable for an ocean-mythology character poster.
