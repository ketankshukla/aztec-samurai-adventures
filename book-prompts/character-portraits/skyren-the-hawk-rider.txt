===================================================================
FORMAT A: INSTAGRAM SQUARE (1080 x 1080 pixels, 72-300 DPI, sRGB)
===================================================================

A cinematic photorealistic character portrait rendered at 1080x1080 pixels with razor-sharp digital precision, advanced volumetric lighting, and ray-traced reflections. ABSOLUTELY NO oil painting, NO watercolor, NO painterly texture. This must look like a still from a $200-million Hollywood fantasy epic — every surface, every texture, every particle of light photographic in quality.

SUBJECT — SKYREN, AERIAL SCOUT OF THE ALLIANCE:

A lithe, wind-carved young woman of indigenous Mesoamerican descent in her early 20s, captured from the chest up in a portrait of exhilarating altitude and freedom. Her face is tilted slightly upward into the wind, eyes narrowed against the rushing air, a fierce grin of pure joy breaking across her features — the expression of a woman who is only truly alive when she is flying. Her hair streams behind her in a horizontal torrent. Over her right shoulder, partially visible, is the massive wing of her war-hawk Cielovar — enormous bronze-gold feathers rendered in photorealistic detail, each barb and barbule individually visible, the wing catching the high-altitude sunlight in a blaze of warm amber. Her left hand grips a leather flight rein, knuckles white, the leather taut with the tension of controlled aerial speed.

FACE — HYPER-DETAILED:

Lean, sharp features shaped by wind and altitude — a narrow, aerodynamic face with prominent cheekbones and a pointed chin. Her warm bronze skin is wind-chapped across the cheeks and the bridge of her nose — a permanent flush from a life spent in freezing high-altitude air. Her eyes are extraordinary — bright amber-gold, the same color as Cielovar's plumage, as though years of bonding have left a mark. Her irises are vivid, almost hawk-like in their intensity, with dark striations radiating from the pupil — the eyes of a woman who can spot a patrol formation from five thousand feet. Her gaze is sharp, exhilarated, alive. A pair of flight goggles with amber-tinted crystal lenses are pushed up onto her forehead, leaving faint goggle-marks around her eyes. Her lips are thin and wind-chapped, curved in that fierce grin. Her nose is small and slightly pointed — she looks like she was built for speed.

HAIR — FLIGHT-READY:

Her hair is dark brown, streaked with natural sun-bleached copper highlights from constant high-altitude UV exposure. It is cut shorter than the other women — shoulder length, practical for flight — and worn in a tight single braid secured with a leather wrap and an amber bead at the tip. In flight, loose strands and baby hairs stream horizontally, caught in the slipstream. A single hawk feather — bronze-gold, from Cielovar — is tucked into the braid behind her right ear, its barbules catching light with iridescent precision.

CLOTHING AND GEAR — AERIAL WARRIOR:

She wears a fitted flight suit of thick, wind-resistant leather — dark brown with amber-gold stitching along the seams. The leather is layered and reinforced at the shoulders, elbows, and forearms — impact protection for aerial combat and hard landings. A short flight jacket with a high collar protects her neck from wind chill — the collar is lined with soft grey fur that ruffles in the wind. Across her chest, a harness of multiple leather straps connects her to Cielovar's flight saddle — the straps are scarred and worn from years of use. A compact signal horn hangs at her right hip — polished brass and jade, used for aerial communication. Flight gloves of supple dark leather protect her hands, the fingertips reinforced for gripping reins at speed.

BACKGROUND — CINEMATIC ATMOSPHERIC:

Behind her and extending past the hawk wing: open sky at incredible altitude — a vast panorama of cloud formations below her, lit from within by golden sunlight. The cloud tops are sculpted by wind into dramatic ridges and valleys of white and amber. Far below, through breaks in the clouds, the green-brown terrain of the continent is visible — impossibly distant, rendered in miniature. The sky above transitions from pale golden-blue at the horizon to deep cerulean directly overhead. Wind-blown turquoise particles trail behind her like a comet's tail — the magical signature of Cielovar's sky-blessing.

TEXT (rendered on the image — ALL TEXT MUST APPEAR ABOVE THE CHARACTER'S HEAD in the top 35% of the frame):

Line 1: "AZTEC SAMURAI ADVENTURES" — small Trajan Pro, turquoise (#40E0D0), letter-spacing 0.15em. Subtle glow.

Line 2: [small vertical gap]

Line 3: "SKYREN" — VERY LARGE bold Trajan Pro, white/cream with warm amber-gold tones and subtle embossed quality. This is the DOMINANT text element — it must command the frame. Approximately 80pt equivalent.

Line 4: "THE HAWK RIDER" — medium Trajan Pro, gold (#FFD700), letter-spacing 0.15em.

Line 5: [small vertical gap]

Line 6: "Wings of the Alliance" — small italic Trajan Pro, cream/gold.
Line 7: "Rider of Cielovar · Eyes of the Sky" — small Trajan Pro, turquoise (#40E0D0).

Line 8: [small vertical gap]

Line 9: "\"Between feathers and bone, the sky remembers who dared to fly.\"" — small italic Trajan Pro, cream with subtle amber glow. This is Skyren's defining quote.

All text centered horizontally, positioned in the top 30-35% of the image against the open sky above the character's head for maximum readability. All text with subtle dark drop shadow for legibility.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — TEXT ABOVE HEAD:

ALL text must be rendered in the top 35% of the image. The character's head begins no higher than 38% from the top. The space between the bottom of the text block and the top of the character's head should feel comfortable — not cramped, not distant. The character's face should be roughly centered vertically in the remaining 60% of the image (approximately 50-70% from top).

MOOD: Exhilarating, free, wind-swept. A hawk rider in her element — the open sky, the rushing wind, the joy of flight. Amber-gold and cerulean blue dominate. Designed to make the viewer's stomach drop — the sensation of altitude, speed, and freedom.

ABSOLUTELY NO oil painting, NO watercolor, NO canvas grain. PHOTOREALISTIC CINEMATIC DIGITAL ART — sharp, clean, precise, and breathtakingly dynamic.

===================================================================
FORMAT B: PORTRAIT (1080 x 1350 pixels, 72-300 DPI, sRGB)
===================================================================

Same subject, clothing, face detail, and atmospheric elements as Format A, but recomposed for the taller portrait ratio. The additional vertical space allows for:

- More expansive sky — deeper blue above, more dramatic cloud formations
- Cielovar's wing more visible — extending further into the frame, with more individual feather detail
- The character visible from the waist up — revealing the full flight harness, the signal horn, and the layered flight suit
- More dramatic sense of altitude — the ground visible far below through cloud breaks

TEXT layout identical to Format A, positioned in the top 30% of the taller frame. Character's head begins at approximately 33% from top.

MOOD: Same exhilarating freedom, but with more cinematic verticality — a sky-warrior portrait suitable for an aviation-fantasy character poster.
