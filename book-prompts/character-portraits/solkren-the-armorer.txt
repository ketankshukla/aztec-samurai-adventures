===================================================================
FORMAT A: INSTAGRAM SQUARE (1080 x 1080 pixels, 72-300 DPI, sRGB)
===================================================================

A cinematic photorealistic character portrait rendered at 1080x1080 pixels with razor-sharp digital precision, advanced volumetric lighting, and ray-traced reflections. ABSOLUTELY NO oil painting, NO watercolor, NO painterly texture. This must look like a still from a $200-million Hollywood fantasy epic — every surface, every texture, every particle of light photographic in quality.

SUBJECT — SOLKREN, MASTER ARMORER OF THE ALLIANCE:

A powerfully built man of indigenous Mesoamerican descent in his late 30s, captured from the chest up in a portrait of immense physical presence and quiet spiritual weight. He is the oldest of the hero team — broader, thicker, more weathered. He faces the viewer almost head-on, his expression one of serene, absolute focus — the look of a man who holds molten metal and souls in his hands and treats both with reverence. In his right hand, raised at chest level, he grips a blacksmith's hammer — not a delicate tool, but a massive, ancient weapon-hammer with a jade-inlaid obsidian head and a grip wrapped in fire-resistant dragon-hide leather. The hammer-head glows faintly with residual heat — deep orange-red, pulsing like a heartbeat. His left hand is open, palm up, and resting on it is a brilliant shard of the reforged Sun-Blade — a fragment of golden-white light, impossibly bright, casting warm radiance upward across his face and chest. The light from the shard reveals threads of every hero's color woven through the metal — turquoise, indigo, crimson, green, violet, amber, gold.

FACE — HYPER-DETAILED:

A face of tremendous character — broad, strong, deeply lined with the marks of decades spent over forges. Wide-set eyes beneath a heavy, prominent brow — dark obsidian-brown, warm and steady, with the patience of a man who understands that the best work takes time. His cheekbones are wide, his jaw massive and square beneath a close-cropped beard of black hair threaded with silver at the chin — the first grey in the hero team, worn with quiet dignity. His warm bronze skin is darker than most of the team — a deep, rich copper tone. His face is marked by his trade: a network of tiny burn scars along his right cheek and jaw, pale against dark skin. His nose is broad and strong, slightly flattened — broken more than once. His lips are set in a calm, nearly gentle expression — the contentment of a man who has found his purpose. His eyebrows are thick and slightly singed at the outer edges — occupational hazard.

HAIR — FORGE-MASTER:

His hair is jet-black with prominent silver streaks at the temples, cropped close to his skull — practical for forge work, no risk of catching fire. His beard is short and meticulously maintained despite the forge environment — trimmed close, squared at the jaw, with that distinguished silver threading. No ornaments in his hair — Solkren's vanity is in his work, not himself.

CLOTHING AND GEAR — MASTER SMITH:

He wears the heavy leather apron of a master armorer — thick, scarred, burn-marked, darkened by years of forge smoke. Beneath it, a sleeveless tunic of dark grey-brown fabric reveals enormous arms — the arms of a man who has swung a hammer tens of thousands of times. His biceps and forearms are massive, corded with muscle and traced with a network of old burn scars and one deliberate ceremonial brand on his right forearm — the mark of a master smith, a stylized sun-disc burned into the skin. Heavy leather gauntlets hang from his belt — currently removed to handle the blade shard with bare hands, a sign of trust and reverence. A heavy tool belt holds tongs, files, chisels, and small jade-lined crucibles. At his waist, visible behind the apron, hangs a sheathed war-hammer — his personal weapon, smaller than his forge hammer but no less deadly.

BACKGROUND — CINEMATIC ATMOSPHERIC:

Behind him, soft-focused (cinematic bokeh): the interior of the soul-forge — a massive, sacred forge space unlike any ordinary smithy. The forge itself is an ancient obsidian altar carved with sun-disc motifs, its fire-pit blazing with golden-white flame that seems almost alive — not normal fire, but sun-fire, the same energy as the Sun-Blade. Shelves of completed weapons line the walls — each one glowing faintly with its own imbued energy. The air is thick with golden sparks, heat-shimmer, and turquoise soul-particles that drift upward like luminous embers. The lighting is dramatic — intense warm orange-gold from the forge, cool turquoise from the soul-energy, creating a sacred, transcendent atmosphere.

TEXT (rendered on the image — ALL TEXT MUST APPEAR ABOVE THE CHARACTER'S HEAD in the top 35% of the frame):

Line 1: "AZTEC SAMURAI ADVENTURES" — small Trajan Pro, turquoise (#40E0D0), letter-spacing 0.15em. Subtle glow.

Line 2: [small vertical gap]

Line 3: "SOLKREN" — VERY LARGE bold Trajan Pro, white/cream with deep forge-orange warmth and subtle embossed quality. This is the DOMINANT text element — it must command the frame. Approximately 80pt equivalent.

Line 4: "THE ARMORER" — medium Trajan Pro, gold (#FFD700), letter-spacing 0.15em.

Line 5: [small vertical gap]

Line 6: "Forger of the Sun-Blade" — small italic Trajan Pro, cream/gold.
Line 7: "Soul-Smith · The Hand That Shapes Destiny" — small Trajan Pro, turquoise (#40E0D0).

Line 8: [small vertical gap]

Line 9: "\"I was never meant to be the blade. I was meant to be the hand that forged it.\"" — small italic Trajan Pro, cream with subtle forge-orange glow. This is Solkren's defining quote.

All text centered horizontally, positioned in the top 30-35% of the image against the darker forge-ceiling areas above the character's head for maximum readability. All text with subtle dark drop shadow for legibility.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — TEXT ABOVE HEAD:

ALL text must be rendered in the top 35% of the image. The character's head begins no higher than 38% from the top. The space between the bottom of the text block and the top of the character's head should feel comfortable — not cramped, not distant. The character's face should be roughly centered vertically in the remaining 60% of the image (approximately 50-70% from top).

MOOD: Sacred, powerful, reverent. A master smith holding the weapon that will save the world — the man who was always invisible until the moment his hands became the most important hands in the war. Deep forge-orange and soul-turquoise in transcendent contrast. Designed to convey quiet, immense power — the viewer understands this man could forge a god's weapon.

ABSOLUTELY NO oil painting, NO watercolor, NO canvas grain. PHOTOREALISTIC CINEMATIC DIGITAL ART — sharp, clean, precise, and monumentally powerful.

===================================================================
FORMAT B: PORTRAIT (1080 x 1350 pixels, 72-300 DPI, sRGB)
===================================================================

Same subject, clothing, face detail, and atmospheric elements as Format A, but recomposed for the taller portrait ratio. The additional vertical space allows for:

- More atmospheric forge interior — the sacred obsidian altar, the weapon-lined walls, the vaulted ceiling with rising sparks
- The character visible from the waist up — revealing the full heavy apron, the war-hammer, the tool belt, and the massive arms in their entirety
- The forge hammer more fully visible in his right hand, its jade-inlaid head glowing with residual heat
- More dramatic forge-fire lighting and soul-particle effects

TEXT layout identical to Format A, positioned in the top 30% of the taller frame. Character's head begins at approximately 33% from top.

MOOD: Same sacred power, but with more environmental grandeur — a master smith's portrait suitable for a mythic-fantasy character poster.
