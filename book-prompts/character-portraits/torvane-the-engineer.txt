===================================================================
FORMAT A: INSTAGRAM SQUARE (1080 x 1080 pixels, 72-300 DPI, sRGB)
===================================================================

A cinematic photorealistic character portrait rendered at 1080x1080 pixels with razor-sharp digital precision, advanced volumetric lighting, and ray-traced reflections. ABSOLUTELY NO oil painting, NO watercolor, NO painterly texture. This must look like a still from a $200-million Hollywood fantasy epic — every surface, every texture, every particle of light photographic in quality.

SUBJECT — TORVANE, ENGINEER OF THE ALLIANCE:

A quietly intense young man of indigenous Mesoamerican descent in his mid-20s, captured from the chest up in a contemplative, focused portrait. He is angled slightly away from the viewer, his gaze directed downward at something he is working on — a complex mechanical device held in his left hand, its inner gears and crystal components glowing faintly with turquoise energy. His right hand holds a precision tool — a jade-tipped stylus — poised over the device with the steady hand of a master craftsman. His expression is one of absolute concentration — brow slightly furrowed, jaw set, the look of a man who sees the world as an elegant machine that he can fix, improve, or weaponize.

FACE — HYPER-DETAILED:

Intelligent, understated features — not classically handsome like Jagren, but compelling in a quieter way. A broad, thoughtful forehead, prominent but not sharp cheekbones, and a strong square jaw that suggests reliability more than theatricality. His warm bronze skin is marked with faint smudges of soot and machine oil along his right cheek and jawline — the marks of a man who works with his hands. His eyes are dark brown, deep-set beneath strong brows, with an observational intensity that misses nothing — the kind of eyes that see structural weaknesses in walls, flaws in enemy formations, and the engineering principles behind magic. Thick-framed jade-tinted work goggles are pushed up onto his forehead — their crystal lenses refracting turquoise light. His lips are set in a neutral line — not unfriendly, just focused. His nose is broad and straight. A burn scar on his right forearm (visible where his sleeve is rolled) marks an early experiment.

HAIR — PRACTICAL AND UNADORNED:

His hair is jet-black, cropped short and practical — close on the sides, slightly longer on top, pushed to one side by the goggles. No braids, no ornaments — Torvane doesn't adorn himself. A pencil of dark charcoal is tucked behind his left ear — his ever-present drafting tool. His hair is slightly dusty, as though he has been working in his workshop for hours.

CLOTHING AND GEAR — WORKSHOP WARRIOR:

He wears a heavy craftsman's apron of thick dark leather over a fitted grey-green workshop tunic — the apron covered in tool loops, small pockets, and scorch marks from forge sparks. The tunic's sleeves are rolled to the elbows, revealing muscular forearms — the arms of a man who hammers steel and carries siege equipment. A wide utility belt carries an array of miniature tools — calipers, a folding ruler, crystal-tipped probes, tiny hammers, and sealed pouches of alchemical compounds. At his left hip, a collapsed portable crossbow of his own design — compact, intricate, mechanical. His vambraces are functional — reinforced leather with built-in tool slots and a small compass embedded in the left bracer.

BACKGROUND — CINEMATIC ATMOSPHERIC:

Behind him, soft-focused (cinematic bokeh): his workshop interior — a warm, cluttered space filled with blueprints pinned to walls, half-built mechanical devices on workbenches, glass jars of glowing crystals, and the orange glow of a small forge in the corner. Sparks drift in the air like fireflies. The lighting is warm amber from the forge, mixed with cooler turquoise from the crystal components scattered across the workshop. Technical drawings and schematics are visible as blurred shapes on the walls behind him.

TEXT (rendered on the image — ALL TEXT MUST APPEAR ABOVE THE CHARACTER'S HEAD in the top 35% of the frame):

Line 1: "AZTEC SAMURAI ADVENTURES" — small Trajan Pro, turquoise (#40E0D0), letter-spacing 0.15em. Subtle glow.

Line 2: [small vertical gap]

Line 3: "TORVANE" — VERY LARGE bold Trajan Pro, white/cream with warm amber tones and subtle embossed quality. This is the DOMINANT text element — it must command the frame. Approximately 80pt equivalent.

Line 4: "THE ENGINEER" — medium Trajan Pro, gold (#FFD700), letter-spacing 0.15em.

Line 5: [small vertical gap]

Line 6: "Master Builder of the Alliance" — small italic Trajan Pro, cream/gold.
Line 7: "Siege Breaker · Quiet Genius · Invisible Hero" — small Trajan Pro, turquoise (#40E0D0).

Line 8: [small vertical gap]

Line 9: "\"Every problem has a mechanism. Find the mechanism, find the solution.\"" — small italic Trajan Pro, cream with subtle amber glow. This is Torvane's defining quote.

All text centered horizontally, positioned in the top 30-35% of the image against the darker workshop ceiling/wall areas above the character's head for maximum readability. All text with subtle dark drop shadow for legibility.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — TEXT ABOVE HEAD:

ALL text must be rendered in the top 35% of the image. The character's head begins no higher than 38% from the top. The space between the bottom of the text block and the top of the character's head should feel comfortable — not cramped, not distant. The character's face should be roughly centered vertically in the remaining 60% of the image (approximately 50-70% from top).

MOOD: Warm, industrious, quietly powerful. A master engineer in his element — the man who keeps the army alive with ingenuity. Amber forge-light and turquoise crystal-glow in cozy contrast. Designed to convey competence and understated brilliance — the viewer knows this is the smartest person in the room.

ABSOLUTELY NO oil painting, NO watercolor, NO canvas grain. PHOTOREALISTIC CINEMATIC DIGITAL ART — sharp, clean, precise, and richly detailed.

===================================================================
FORMAT B: PORTRAIT (1080 x 1350 pixels, 72-300 DPI, sRGB)
===================================================================

Same subject, clothing, face detail, and atmospheric elements as Format A, but recomposed for the taller portrait ratio. The additional vertical space allows for:

- More atmospheric workshop environment above — hanging tools, blueprints, crystal jars on high shelves
- The character visible from the waist up — revealing the full utility belt, the collapsed crossbow, and the heavy craftsman's apron
- More visible workshop detail — the forge glow, scattered components, half-finished devices
- The mechanical device in his hands more visible and detailed

TEXT layout identical to Format A, positioned in the top 30% of the taller frame. Character's head begins at approximately 33% from top.

MOOD: Same quiet brilliance, but with more environmental storytelling — an inventor's portrait suitable for a steampunk-fantasy character poster.
