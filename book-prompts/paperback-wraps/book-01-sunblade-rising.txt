A breathtaking ultra-high-resolution photorealistic full paperback wrap cover rendered at 3878x2775 pixels, 300 DPI, CMYK color profile optimized for print. Sharp cinematic digital rendering with advanced volumetric lighting and ray-traced reflections. This must look like a premium Hollywood movie poster printed as a book jacket. ABSOLUTELY NO oil painting, NO watercolor, NO painterly brushstrokes, NO soft-focus filters, NO traditional media aesthetic. Every pixel razor-sharp, hyper-detailed, cinematically lit.

The entire wrap is a single continuous panoramic scene — a sweeping view of the Sun-Blade temple complex at golden hour, designed so the back cover, spine, and front cover flow together seamlessly when the book is laid flat and open.

--- BACK COVER (left 1875 pixels) ---

A hauntingly atmospheric scene depicting the aftermath of the Dominion raid — the outer courtyard of a great Mesoamerican temple in the final moments of dusk. The perspective looks inward toward the temple from the ruins beyond — crumbling limestone steps descend into deep shadow, flanked by toppled stone pillars whose surfaces still bear the carved faces of ancient warrior-gods, now cracked and weathered. Vines of dark emerald creep across the broken stonework. The ground is scattered with obsidian shards — remnants of shattered ceremonial objects — and among them, a single obsidian token lies in a pool of faint turquoise light, its surface etched with a sun-disc symbol that glows with residual magical energy.

Ash-oath sigils — sinister geometric brands burned into the stone by Dominion blood-magic — pulse with a dim crimson-violet light on three of the broken columns, marking the territory as claimed. Wisps of dark smoke curl upward from the sigils, dissolving into the darkening sky. The atmosphere is heavy with loss — this was sacred ground, and it has been violated. Yet there is beauty in the ruin — golden light from the setting sun still catches the moss-covered edges of the fallen stones, and turquoise mystical particles drift through the scene like luminous ghosts, suggesting that the magic of this place is wounded but not dead.

The sky above the back cover is the darkest portion of the panorama — deep indigo transitioning to star-flecked obsidian at the top-left corner, with faint turquoise aurora shimmer visible at the horizon line. The mood is somber, ominous, but not hopeless — it is the darkness before the dawn that the front cover promises.

BACK COVER TEXT (rendered directly on the image, all within safety margins):

Top 12% of back panel: "AZTEC SAMURAI ADVENTURES" — small elegant Trajan Pro font, centered horizontally within the back panel, turquoise color (#40E0D0), letter-spacing 0.15em, approximately 12pt equivalent. Subtle turquoise glow behind letters.

15-18% of back panel: A thin ornamental gold and turquoise filigree divider — Aztec geometric scrollwork, matching the front cover divider style but smaller.

20-62% of back panel (blurb area): Centered block of text in warm cream/white Garamond font, approximately 11pt equivalent, with comfortable line spacing. The text reads:

"She didn't ask to be chosen. The blade didn't ask for permission."

[blank line]

"When the Dominion raids her temple and steals a sacred relic, warrior Itzil is thrust into a war she never expected -- armed with a blade of pure sunlight that hasn't manifested in three hundred years and a prophecy she doesn't believe in."

[blank line]

"The Dominion is hunting seven ancient relics that can open a gate sealed for centuries. On the other side: something vast, hungry, and patient. Itzil must gather allies, find the relics first, and become the leader the world needs -- even though she's not sure she's the leader anyone wants."

[blank line]

"Sunblade Rising is epic fantasy that combines the warrior traditions of Mesoamerica with the disciplined philosophy of the samurai in a world where empires are built on stolen souls and the only weapon that can stop them is the courage to show up."

65% of back panel: A second thin ornamental divider matching the one above.

68% of back panel: "Book 1 of 12 in the Aztec Samurai Adventures series" — italic Garamond, cream/gold, small, centered.

72% of back panel: "Published by Metronagon" — small Trajan Pro, gold (#FFD700), centered.

Bottom-right corner (80-95%): CLEAR ZONE — a 2" x 1.2" rectangular area with NO text and NO important visual elements, reserved for barcode/ISBN placement. The background in this zone should be relatively dark and uniform to ensure barcode readability.

--- SPINE (center approximately 203 pixels wide) ---

Deep obsidian-black gradient — darkest at the edges, with a single thin vertical line of golden light running precisely through the center of the spine from top to bottom, like the edge of a blade glimpsed in darkness. Faint turquoise particles drift across the spine, connecting the back and front covers visually.

SPINE TEXT (rendered vertically, reading from top to bottom when the book stands upright on a shelf):

Upper portion (top 10-60% of spine): "SUNBLADE RISING" — Trajan Pro font, white/cream with subtle golden warmth, vertical orientation reading top-to-bottom. Letter-spacing comfortable for readability at spine width.

Lower portion (65-85% of spine): "KETAN SHUKLA" — Trajan Pro font, gold (#FFD700), vertical orientation reading top-to-bottom.

Very bottom (88-95% of spine): Small Metronagon publisher logo/mark — a tiny stylized "M" in turquoise (#40E0D0).

All spine text must be centered horizontally within the spine width and must fall entirely within the safety margins.

--- FRONT COVER (right 1875 pixels) ---

The front cover depicts the heart of the Sun-Blade temple at the peak of golden hour — the sacred inner courtyard where Itzil trains and where the Sun-Blade first manifested. This is the light that answers the back cover's darkness.

SUBJECT — ITZIL, THE SUN-BLADE BEARER:

A breathtakingly gorgeous young woman of indigenous Mesoamerican descent in her early 20s, positioned in the lower-right quadrant of the front cover panel. She is captured in a moment of devastating power — her jade-obsidian katana raised at a diagonal, the blade erupting with blinding golden sunfire that streaks outward in razor-sharp rays. Her body is coiled with lethal grace — weight shifted, left hand extended with golden light crackling between her fingertips. She is the fusion of breathtaking beauty and terrifying warrior power.

Her face is rendered with obsessive photorealistic detail — high sculpted cheekbones catching golden light, warm bronze skin with visible pores and a luminous natural glow, obsidian-dark eyes shot through with golden amber striations that seem to burn with inner fire. Her expression is steady, burning certainty — not rage, but the calm of a woman who has already decided the outcome. Full terracotta-rose lips, strong natural brows, a crescent scar at her left collarbone. Her raven-black hair streams behind her in elaborate warrior braids threaded with turquoise beads and gold rings, with a magnificent quetzal-feather crest on her left shoulder.

She wears layered obsidian-lacquered plate armor with gold sun-disc filigree, over richly patterned Mesoamerican textiles. Her Sun-Blade blazes with structured golden sunfire. Every detail of skin, metal, feather, and fabric rendered with cinematic precision.

BACKGROUND (behind Itzil on front cover): Massive stone columns of the inner temple, golden god-rays streaming between them. The cracked Demon Gate archway visible in the distance, dark energy seeping from its fractures. The sky transitions from golden amber at the horizon to the turquoise aurora at the top. Turquoise particles and golden embers fill the air.

--- PANORAMIC CONTINUITY ---

The entire wrap must flow as one continuous scene. The back cover's ruined outer courtyard transitions through the spine's blade-edge of golden light into the front cover's blazing inner sanctum. The sky gradient runs continuously from dark indigo (back cover top-left) through the spine to golden amber (front cover top-right). Turquoise particles drift across all three sections. When laid flat, the wrap tells a visual story: from the darkness of what was lost, through the razor-thin edge of a blade, to the golden fire of what will rise.
