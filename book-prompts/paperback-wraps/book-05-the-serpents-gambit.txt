--- BACK COVER (left 1875px) ---

A claustrophobic scene — a narrow alley behind a Dominion intelligence building at night. Wet cobblestones reflect crimson light from distant ash-candle streetlamps. Dark stone walls rise on both sides, closing in. A coiled rope hangs from an upper window — an escape route used moments ago. On the ground, a discarded Dominion officer's rank insignia lies in a puddle, its silver surface catching the reflection of the night sky. Beside it, a thin stiletto blade, also discarded. The scene tells a story: someone was here, someone shed a disguise, someone ran. The only question is whether they escaped.

Crimson light seeps from the building's windows. Distant footsteps and alarm bells are suggested by the tension in the scene. A single rat watches from a drain grate, its eyes two tiny points of reflected light.

BACK COVER TEXT (within safety margins):

Top 12%: "AZTEC SAMURAI ADVENTURES" — small Trajan Pro, turquoise (#40E0D0), centered.
15-18%: Gold/turquoise filigree divider.

20-62% (blurb, cream/white Garamond, ~11pt, centered):

"He became the enemy to destroy them. Now he's forgetting which side he's on."

[blank line]

"Kaelen goes deeper undercover than any operative has ever gone -- into the beating heart of the Dominion's intelligence apparatus. With a stolen identity, a dyed haircut, and a Dominion officer's coat, he walks among the people who burned his unit and smiles at them over breakfast."

[blank line]

"But the longer he wears the mask, the better it fits. And when Relicara -- the Dominion's relic collector -- sets a trap baited with the one thing Kaelen can't resist, the line between the spy and the soldier begins to blur."

[blank line]

"In the Dominion's shadow, the greatest danger isn't being caught. It's becoming what you pretend to be."

65%: Ornamental divider.
68%: "Book 5 of 12 in the Aztec Samurai Adventures series" — italic Garamond, cream/gold.

--- PANORAMIC CONTINUITY ---

Back cover's dark alley (the spy's escape) transitions through spine's split light into front cover's split-identity portrait. The dual color temperature — cool left, warm right — runs across all panels. Visual story: from the discarded disguise, through the blade-edge between identities, to the man trapped between two selves.

CRITICAL: 0.125" bleed. 0.25" safety margin. CMYK. NO oil painting.
