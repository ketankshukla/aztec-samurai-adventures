--- BACK COVER (left 1875px) ---

A devastating scene — the ruins of the alliance's hidden base, built into a cliff face, now shattered and burning. The cliff itself has been split by Dominion bombardment — massive cracks run through the stone, and entire sections of the base's architecture have collapsed into rubble. Fires burn in the wreckage — orange and crimson against the dark stone. The obsidian rain falls relentlessly — tiny black glass shards streaking down from a volcanic grey sky, accumulating on every horizontal surface in a glittering, treacherous layer. The corrupted river flows past the base's ruins — thick, black-violet, pulsing with crimson blood-magic veins beneath its surface.

In the foreground, abandoned supplies — medical crates, weapon racks, scattered personal belongings — litter the ground, half-buried in obsidian shards. A child's carved wooden toy — a small hawk — lies among the debris, its paint chipped, a symbol of everything the alliance tried to protect and couldn't.

--- PANORAMIC CONTINUITY ---

Back cover's destroyed base transitions through spine's turquoise water-line into front cover's Rainara purifying the corrupted river. The obsidian rain falls continuously across all three panels. The corrupted water's crimson-violet glow on the back cover yields to turquoise purity on the front. Visual story: from what was lost, through the thread of hope, to the woman who can heal a poisoned world.

CRITICAL: 0.125" bleed. 0.25" safety margin. CMYK. NO oil painting.
