--- BACK COVER (left 1875px) ---

A scene of raw creative power — the interior of Solkren's workshop, viewed from above at a slight angle. A massive stone workbench dominates the frame, its surface covered with the tools and materials of impossible craft: hammers of varying sizes arranged in precise order, tongs, chisels, files, polishing stones, and mysterious instruments that blend engineering with mysticism. Scattered among the tools are fragments of materials — shards of jade-green steel, flakes of volcanic obsidian, nuggets of raw gold, turquoise gemstone rough. Technical drawings are pinned to the bench edge — cross-section diagrams of the Sun-Blade, annotated in Solkren's precise handwriting, showing the layered construction of jade steel and obsidian.

At the center of the workbench, in a cleared space, lies a velvet cloth holding the two broken halves of the Sun-Blade — dark, cold, the fracture edges still visible. Around the broken pieces, arranged in a careful ritual circle, are seven small stones — each one representing one of the sacred relics. Five glow faintly (the recovered relics); two are dark (the ones still held by the Dominion). The forge itself is visible in the background — massive, dark, unlit, waiting.

The lighting is cool workshop light — daylight from a high window mixing with the faint turquoise glow of the relic-stones. The atmosphere is preparation — the calm, meticulous moment before creation begins.

"Solkren has spent his entire life as the invisible member of the team -- the armorer, the builder, the man whose hands shaped every weapon the heroes carry. Now the world asks him for the impossible: reforge the Sun-Blade using techniques lost for three centuries, tempered by forbidden power, infused with the souls of everyone who has ever carried it."

[blank line]

"But the forge demands a price. The metal remembers everything -- every battle, every loss, every death. And the man who holds the hammer must carry all of it."

[blank line]

"From the ashes of Book 8's devastation, hope returns -- shaped by fire, hammered by will, and cooled in tears."

--- PANORAMIC CONTINUITY ---

Back cover's cold workshop with broken blade pieces transitions through spine's white-hot forge line into front cover's blazing reforging scene. Temperature rises dramatically left to right — cool preparation to incandescent creation. Visual story: from the broken pieces laid out for surgery, through the fire that transforms, to the man whose hands remake destiny.
