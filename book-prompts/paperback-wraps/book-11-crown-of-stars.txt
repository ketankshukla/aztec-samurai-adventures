An epic wide-angle scene — the allied army assembled on a vast plain before the Dominion capital, viewed from behind the army looking toward the city. Thousands of soldiers stand in formation — ranks upon ranks, their armor and weapons catching the pre-dawn light. Different banners fly above different contingents — each nation of the alliance represented by its own colors and sigils: gold and turquoise for the Sun-Blade order, blue and silver for the northern kingdoms, green and brown for the forest nations, white and coral for the coastal peoples. The banners snap in a stiff wind, creating a sea of color above the dark-armored masses below.

In the far distance, the Dominion capital rises — a dark fortress of concentric black stone walls, each ring higher than the last, culminating in Volzentar's central tower — a spire of iron and obsidian that pierces the sky. The city is lit from within by crimson ash-candle light that leaks from every window and murder-hole, making the entire fortress glow like a coal. Above the city, the Starless Crown hangs in the sky — but noticeably smaller than in previous books, its edges fraying, stars beginning to reclaim the void around it. Dawn light is breaking on the eastern horizon, golden and unstoppable.

The mood is the breathless moment before the charge — anticipation, terror, and hope compressed into a single heartbeat.

BACK COVER TEXT (within safety margins):

Top 12%: "AZTEC SAMURAI ADVENTURES" — small Trajan Pro, turquoise (#40E0D0), centered.
15-18%: Gold/turquoise filigree divider — the most elaborate yet, matching the front cover.

20-62% (blurb, cream/white Garamond, ~11pt, centered):

"Every villain. Every hero. Every weapon forged and every oath sworn. It all ends here."

[blank line]

"The allied army stands before the gates of the Dominion capital -- the largest force ever assembled, united by a woman who was once a reluctant warrior and is now the most feared commander alive. Inside those walls, Volzentar waits. Nightshade waits. Every remaining villain who has haunted the alliance for eleven books waits."

[blank line]

"Itzil carries the reforged Sun-Blade, brighter and more powerful than it has ever been. Behind her stands every friend, every ally, every person she has inspired, saved, or led through the darkness."

[blank line]

"The stars are returning. The Crown is cracking. And the final siege begins at dawn."

Deep obsidian-black gradient with a thin vertical line of brilliant golden light — the strongest, brightest spine-line in the series, blazing with confidence and power. Tiny points of light (returning stars) are scattered along its length.

--- PANORAMIC CONTINUITY ---

Back cover's assembled army transitions through spine's brilliant golden line into front cover's breach of the gates. The army on the back flows through the spine and into the front — one continuous charge. The Starless Crown spans the upper sky across all panels but is visibly cracking and shrinking from left to right. Dawn light brightens from left to right — darkest behind the army, brightest where Itzil's blade blazes through the gates. Visual story: from the moment before the charge, through the golden blade-edge of destiny, to the commander who leads the final battle.

CRITICAL: 0.125" bleed. 0.25" safety margin. CMYK. NO oil painting.
