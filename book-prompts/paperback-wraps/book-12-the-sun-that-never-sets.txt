--- BACK COVER (left 1875px) ---

The most peaceful image in the entire series — a landscape of healing. A wide valley viewed from a gentle hilltop, bathed in warm morning light. The valley has been scarred by war — there are still visible marks: a patch of scorched earth being reclaimed by new grass, a broken wall being rebuilt by tiny figures of workers, the filled-in trench of a former defensive line now planted with young saplings. But the overwhelming impression is growth and renewal. Fields are being tilled. A river runs clear and blue through the valley's center — the same kind of river that was poisoned in Book 6, now clean and sparkling. Children play near the riverbank — tiny silhouettes in the golden light. Smoke rises from village chimneys — cooking fires, not war fires. Birds fly in formation across the sky.

In the very foreground, on the hilltop where the viewer stands, a single obsidian token lies in the grass — the same token Korvain gave Itzil in Book 1. It catches the morning sun in a flash of gold on black. It has been placed here deliberately — a memorial, a marker, a full circle.

The sky is the back cover's glory — a magnificent sunrise filling the upper portion with layered bands of gold, coral, peach, and soft blue. Real stars are fading into the dawn — visible, natural, returned. No Starless Crown. No void. Just sky.

BACK COVER TEXT (within safety margins):

Top 12%: "AZTEC SAMURAI ADVENTURES" — small Trajan Pro, turquoise (#40E0D0), centered.
15-18%: The most elaborate gold/turquoise filigree divider in the series — incorporating ALL motifs from all 12 books (sun-discs, mirrors, oaths, crowns, serpents, water, feathers, blades, forges, healing light, stars, and dawn).

20-62% (blurb, cream/white Garamond, ~11pt, centered):

"The war is over. The world remains. And the hardest part of any fight is learning to live in the peace you bled for."

[blank line]

"VASTRIX is destroyed. The Great Gate is sealed. The Starless Crown is shattered and the stars have returned to the sky. But the world the heroes fought to save is not the world they left behind. Nations must be rebuilt. Wounds must be healed. And the warriors who spent two years fighting for survival must learn something far harder: how to live."

[blank line]

"This is the final chapter of the Aztec Samurai Adventures -- the story of what comes after the battle, what hope looks like when it's earned, and what legacy means when you've given everything to build it."

[blank line]

"The sun is rising. And this time, it will never set."

65%: Matching elaborate ornamental divider.
68%: "Book 12 of 12 in the Aztec Samurai Adventures series — The Final Chapter" — italic Garamond, cream/gold.
72%: "Published by Metronagon" — small Trajan Pro, gold.
Bottom-right (80-95%): CLEAR barcode zone.

--- SPINE (~203px) ---

Deep obsidian-black gradient transitioning to warm golden-amber at the center — the spine itself brightening, the darkness yielding, a visual metaphor for the entire series' journey from shadow to light. The thin vertical line is pure, warm, golden-white — the steadiest, most peaceful light in the spine series.

SPINE TEXT (vertical, top-to-bottom):
Upper (10-60%): "THE SUN THAT NEVER SETS" — Trajan Pro, white/cream, vertical.
Lower (65-85%): "KETAN SHUKLA" — Trajan Pro, gold, vertical.
Bottom (88-95%): Metronagon "M" mark, turquoise.

--- FRONT COVER (right 1875px) ---

Identical to Book 12 ebook cover — the full ensemble of surviving heroes standing together on a stone terrace, the magnificent sunrise behind them, Itzil at center with the Sun-Blade glowing peacefully, Kaelen at her side, every character rendered with individual beauty and personality, the world green and healing below them.

FRONT COVER TEXT:
3%: "AZTEC SAMURAI ADVENTURES" — turquoise, brightest rendering in the series.
6%: "BOOK XII" — gold, flanked by lines. Below: "THE FINAL CHAPTER" — tiny turquoise italic.
10-22%: "THE SUN THAT / NEVER SETS" — large Trajan Pro, golden-white with radiant glow.
24%: Comprehensive 12-book filigree divider.
26%: "Dawn of a New World" — italic, warm golden-cream.
28%: Matching comprehensive divider.
92%: "KETAN SHUKLA" — large, white/cream with golden warmth.

--- PANORAMIC CONTINUITY ---

Back cover's healing valley and sunrise transitions through spine's brightening golden line into front cover's hero ensemble at dawn. The sunrise spans the entire wrap — a single, continuous, world-spanning dawn that connects the healing land to the people who healed it. The obsidian token on the back cover's hilltop connects visually to the Sun-Blade in Itzil's hand on the front — where Korvain's gift began, his legacy stands completed.

This is the only wrap in the series where the panorama tells a story of peace rather than war. The visual journey from left to right is: the world as it heals, the golden thread of light that connects past to present, and the people who made it possible.

CRITICAL: 0.125" bleed. 0.25" safety margin. CMYK. NO oil painting.
