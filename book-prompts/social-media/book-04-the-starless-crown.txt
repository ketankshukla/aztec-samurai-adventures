SCENE: A wide-angle battlefield at night — burning siege engines, fallen banners, churned earth. Above everything, the Starless Crown dominates the sky — a crown-shaped void devouring the stars, tendrils of anti-light reaching down toward the carnage below. In the center-right, a lone figure kneels — Jagren — silhouetted against the firelight, twin-bladed staff planted before him, head raised toward the descending void. Embers rise from the fires, reaching toward the Crown only to be extinguished at its boundary. The contrast between the warm orange firelight below and the absolute void-black above is devastating.

SCENE: Tight portrait of Jagren from chest up. His gorgeous face is bloodied and defiant — the cut across his cheekbone, the wild black curls, the burning dark eyes with copper-gold flecks blazing in the firelight. His teeth are bared in a fierce grin or battle cry. Fire illuminates one side of his face in warm orange; the Starless Crown's anti-light darkens the other side to absolute void. His gold arena earring catches firelight. The energy is raw, kinetic, alive.
