SCENE: A wide shot of a mountain pass in ash-fall — grey ash drifting from a choked sky, coating every surface. In the center of the frame, two broken halves of a katana lie on scorched stone, their fracture edges glowing with fading ember-orange light — the last heat of a dying weapon. The broken pieces are arranged as they fell — slightly apart, the gap between them a wound in the image itself. Behind the broken blade, far in the background, a fading circle of golden light contracts on the ground — Korvain's last energy dissipating. The Starless Crown looms overhead. The mood is devastating silence after catastrophic loss. No figures visible — just the broken weapon and the empty space where its bearer knelt.

SCENE: Tight portrait of Itzil from chest up — the most emotionally raw image in the series. Her breathtaking face is streaked with tears that catch fading ember-light, turning them into rivers of amber on her bronze skin. Her obsidian-dark eyes are wide, staring downward at something below frame (the broken blade). The golden amber striations in her irises are dim — the inner fire fading. Her warrior braids are loosened, strands falling across her face. Ash dusts her hair and shoulders. The lighting is cold — grey and ash-toned — with only the faint orange-amber of the dying blade reflecting upward onto her jaw and throat. Heartbreakingly beautiful in her grief.
