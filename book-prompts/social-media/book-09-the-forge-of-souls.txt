SCENE: A wide shot of the sacred forge cavern — dark volcanic stone walls rising into shadow, turquoise-glowing runes pulsing in concentric patterns. At the center, the ceremonial forge blazes with white-gold fire — the most intense light source in any social media image in the series. Solkren's silhouette stands before the forge, massive and powerful, tongs gripping the white-hot reforging blade. Thousands of sparks cascade outward in brilliant arcs, filling the cavern with golden stars. The silhouettes of watching heroes line the cavern walls — identifiable by their outlines: Itzil's braids, Kaelen's bow, Jagren's staff, Skyren's feathered cloak. The mood is primal creation — fire, metal, and hope being hammered into shape.

SCENE: Tight portrait of Solkren from chest up — bare-chested, forge-lit, magnificent. His broad, powerful face is illuminated entirely by white-gold forge light from below, creating dramatic uplighting that emphasizes his heavy bone structure — wide cheekbones, square jaw, prominent brow. His deep brown skin glistens with sweat, each droplet a bead of liquid gold. His dark eyes are focused with absolute concentration, reflecting the white-hot blade in twin points of fire. Soot dusts his face. His short black hair sparkles with embedded metallic particles. Sparks cascade past him in golden streaks. The energy is raw creative power — the beauty of a man at the peak of his purpose.
