SCENE: A wide shot of the Mirror-Realm — an infinite hallway of reflective surfaces stretching to vanishing points in every direction. The mirrors don't show normal reflections — each surface displays a different scene: freed slaves with clear eyes, Dominion soldiers swearing ash-oaths, a healer's hands glowing turquoise. In the center of the frame, Neyla stands with arms extended, turquoise healing energy radiating from her palms in streams that flow into the nearest mirror surface — where the turquoise light touches the mirror, the false reflection dissolves, replaced by truth. In the far mirrors, the fragmented face of Mirathane watches from a dozen surfaces simultaneously — beautiful, cold, and dangerous.

SCENE: Tight portrait of Neyla from chest up — eyes closed in fierce concentration, her luminously beautiful face lit by turquoise healing energy from below. Her long dark lashes fan against her cheeks, beaded with tiny tears of effort. Her smooth brown skin glows with warmth. The turquoise light from her healing hands (below frame) illuminates her face in soft, otherworldly blue-green tones. Water droplets and turquoise particles float around her. Behind her, mirror surfaces reflect her face from multiple angles — each reflection slightly different, some showing her smiling, some showing her in pain, the Mirror-Realm playing tricks. The gentlest face in the series, wielding the most powerful weapon.
