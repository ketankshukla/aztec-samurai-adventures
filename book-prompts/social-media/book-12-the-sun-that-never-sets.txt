SCENE: A wide panoramic shot of the hero ensemble standing on a stone terrace at sunrise, viewed from a low angle that makes them look monumental against the vast sky. The full group is visible as silhouettes and golden-lit figures — Itzil at center with the Sun-Blade glowing peacefully, Kaelen at her side, Jagren with his staff over his shoulder, Skyren with her hawk perched nearby, Neyla, Torvane, Rainara, Zariel, Solkren — each identifiable by their distinctive silhouette. Behind them, the most magnificent sunrise in the series fills the sky — layered bands of gold, coral, peach, turquoise, and soft blue. The world below them is green, healing, alive. Birds fly in the distance. No war. No void. Just dawn.

SCENE: A warm, intimate group portrait — the surviving heroes arranged in a tight composition, faces visible and individually beautiful. Itzil at center, Sun-Blade held vertically before her, glowing with gentle golden light. Kaelen at her left, pale eyes soft with unguarded adoration. Jagren at her right, grinning. The other heroes arranged around them — every face lit by warm sunrise light, every expression showing hard-won peace and genuine happiness. Neyla's eyes glisten with happy tears. Torvane's spectacles catch golden light. Skyren grins fiercely. Zariel's diplomat smile is finally genuine. Solkren stands solid and content. Rainara's sea-green eyes reflect turquoise light. The background is a soft golden bokeh of sunrise. The energy is joy, relief, love, and earned peace.
