## 📐 GUIDING PRINCIPLES (The 4Cs)

1. **CONTINUITY** — Every event, character arc, and power level must track across all books. No retcons.
2. **CLARITY** — Every chapter must be instantly understandable by the target audience. Action first, exposition woven in. Every book includes "Where We Have Been" and "Where We're Headed."
3. **CONSISTENCY** — Tone, voice, power rules, and character behavior must feel the same across all books.
4. **COHERENCY** — The overall arc must feel like ONE story told in multiple parts. Each book is complete but also part of the larger war/conflict.

**Secondary Romances (if any):** [List any other romantic pairings]

---

## 💀 CHARACTER DEATH STRATEGY

**Act I:** NO major hero deaths. Build reader investment. Close calls only.
**Act II:** [0-2] hero deaths. Must be earned, devastating, and meaningful.
**Act III:** [0-2] hero deaths. Ultimate price of victory.
**Total across series:** [2-4] maximum.

**Characters who NEVER die:**

- [PROTAGONIST NAME] — the heart of the series
- [ROMANTIC INTEREST NAME] — killing a love interest feels punishing
- [COMIC RELIEF NAME] — their death would feel like the series lost its soul

**Death candidates (not confirmed — to be decided during outlining):**

- [NAME] — [Why they could die and what it would mean]
- [NAME] — [Why they could die and what it would mean]

---

## 🗣️ NARRATION STYLE

**POV:** [e.g., Third person limited, close POV / First person / Omniscient]

**Voice Rules:**

- [e.g., Short, punchy sentences in action scenes]
- [e.g., Vivid sensory details]
- [e.g., Emotional honesty — characters feel things intensely]
- [e.g., Humor between heroes (banter, nicknames, teasing)]
- [e.g., Villains who are genuinely scary AND fascinating]

**Sample Voice Targets:**

- **[CHARACTER]:** [Style] — _"[Sample dialogue]"_
- **[CHARACTER]:** [Style] — _"[Sample dialogue]"_
- **[VILLAIN]:** [Style] — _"[Sample dialogue]"_

---

## 📖 BOOK TITLE FORMAT

**Format:** [e.g., [Series Name] Book [N]: [Main Title] — [Subtitle]]

- **Main title** = evocative, intriguing, sounds epic
- **Subtitle** = clear, tells the reader what to expect

---

## ✍️ CHAPTER CLIFFHANGERS

### Within Each Book (Chapter-to-Chapter)

Rotate between these types:

- **Danger** — character in immediate peril
- **Revelation** — shocking information revealed
- **Emotional** — relationship rupture or sacrifice
- **Mystery** — something unexplained happens
- **Action** — mid-battle cut to another POV
- **Arrival** — someone or something unexpected appears

### Between Books (Book-to-Book)

- Book ends with major victory BUT bigger threat revealed
- Book ends with a character captured, missing, or transformed
- Book ends with a game-changing revelation
- **The last line of every book should be a gut-punch**

---

## 🏁 SERIES EPILOGUE

**Approach:** [e.g., Time Skip + Passing the Torch + Letter to the Reader]

**Requirements:**

- Inspiring — reader finishes feeling empowered
- Full of lessons learned
- Emotionally satisfying — every arc resolved
- Earned and bittersweet — not saccharine
- NOT a cliffhanger — the main conflict is RESOLVED

**Every book's epilogue** = cliffhanger + "What Comes Next" tease
**Series finale epilogue** = inspiring conclusion + sequel series tease

---

### 💡 LESSONS LEARNED (From the Aztec Samurai Adventures process)

**Chapter writing workflow:**

- Write chapters as individual UTF-8 markdown files using PowerShell `Set-Content -Encoding UTF8`
- Each chapter file starts with a title line: `Chapter [N] - [TITLE IN CAPS]`
- Write one chapter per AI response to avoid file conflicts and maintain quality
- Commit and push after completing each book (not each chapter)

**Front matter (4 files per book):**

- `copyright.md` — standard copyright, ISBN placeholder, publisher info
- `dedication.md` — personal dedication
- `epigraph.md` — thematic quote (can be from the story's world)
- `dramatis_personae.md` — character list organized by faction/role

**Back matter (5 files per book):**

- `also_by.md` — list of other books by the author
- `about_the_author.md` — author biography
- `authors_note.md` — reflection on themes and process for this book
- `connect.md` — website, email, newsletter signup
- `review_request.md` — reader review request with gratitude

**DOCX generation:**

- Use a PowerShell script (`make_book_docx.ps1`) that combines all chapter `.md` files into one DOCX via Pandoc
- Use `pageBreakBefore` on chapter heading paragraphs (raw OpenXML) to avoid blank pages
- Do NOT use standalone page break paragraphs — they cause blank pages when chapter content aligns with page boundaries
- Verify every generated DOCX for blank pages using Word COM automation

**File naming conventions:**

- Book folders: `Book [NN] - [Title] - [Subtitle]`
- Chapter files: `chapter_[NN]_[slug_with_underscores].md`
- Chapter summaries: `chapter_[NN]_summary.md`
- Book summary: `book_[NN]_summary.md`
