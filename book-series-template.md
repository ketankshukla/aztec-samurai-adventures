## 📐 GUIDING PRINCIPLES (The 4Cs)

1. **CONTINUITY** — Every event, character arc, and power level must track across all books. No retcons.
2. **CLARITY** — Every chapter must be instantly understandable by the target audience. Action first, exposition woven in. Every book includes "Where We Have Been" and "Where We're Headed."
3. **CONSISTENCY** — Tone, voice, power rules, and character behavior must feel the same across all books.
4. **COHERENCY** — The overall arc must feel like ONE story told in multiple parts. Each book is complete but also part of the larger war/conflict.

**Act III:** [0-2] hero deaths. Ultimate price of victory.
**Total across series:** [2-4] maximum.

**Characters who NEVER die:**
- [PROTAGONIST NAME] — the heart of the series

- [COMIC RELIEF NAME] — their death would feel like the series lost its soul

**Death candidates (not confirmed — to be decided during outlining):**
- [NAME] — [Why they could die and what it would mean]
- [NAME] — [Why they could die and what it would mean]

---

## 🗣️ NARRATION STYLE

**Voice Rules:**

- **[VILLAIN]:** [Style] — _"[Sample dialogue]"_

---

## 📖 BOOK TITLE FORMAT

**Format:** [e.g., [Series Name] Book [N]: [Main Title] — [Subtitle]]

- **Main title** = evocative, intriguing, sounds epic
- **Subtitle** = clear, tells the reader what to expect

---

## ✍️ CHAPTER CLIFFHANGERS

### Within Each Book (Chapter-to-Chapter)
Rotate between these types:
- **Danger** — character in immediate peril
- **Revelation** — shocking information revealed
- **Emotional** — relationship rupture or sacrifice
- **Mystery** — something unexplained happens
- **Action** — mid-battle cut to another POV
- **Arrival** — someone or something unexpected appears

### Between Books (Book-to-Book)
- Book ends with major victory BUT bigger threat revealed
- Book ends with a character captured, missing, or transformed
- Book ends with a game-changing revelation
- **The last line of every book should be a gut-punch**

---

## 🏁 SERIES EPILOGUE

**Approach:** [e.g., Time Skip + Passing the Torch + Letter to the Reader]

**Requirements:**
- Inspiring — reader finishes feeling empowered
- Full of lessons learned
- Emotionally satisfying — every arc resolved
- Earned and bittersweet — not saccharine
- NOT a cliffhanger — the main conflict is RESOLVED

**Every book's epilogue** = cliffhanger + "What Comes Next" tease
**Series finale epilogue** = inspiring conclusion + sequel series tease
