# Author's Note

Thank you for reading *Sunblade Rising*.

This story began with a simple question: what would happen if you took the warrior traditions of ancient Mesoamerica and the disciplined philosophy of the samurai and combined them into a single world? Not as a historical exercise, but as a fantasy — a place where golden blades are forged from will, where empires are built on stolen souls, and where the person standing between the world and its destruction is a young woman who doesn't believe she's qualified for the job.

Itzil's doubt is not a weakness. It's the most honest thing about her. The people who never doubt are the ones who stop growing. The people who doubt and move forward anyway — those are the ones worth following.

This is Book 1 of a twelve-book journey. The team you've met here — Itzil, Kaelen, Jagren, Torvane, and Neyla — is only the beginning. More heroes will join. More villains will emerge. The stakes will rise from a stolen relic to the fate of a continent, and eventually to the fate of reality itself.

But it all starts here. With smoke and bells and a girl who showed up.

I hope you'll continue the journey with me.

With gratitude,
Ketan Shukla
