# Aztec Samurai Adventures Book 1: Sunblade Rising - A Blade Forged in Light

What if the weapon that could save the world chose a woman who didn't believe she deserved it?

Itzil is a warrior of the Sun-Blade temple — disciplined, stubborn, and quietly convinced that she will never be enough. Trained since childhood by the legendary grandmaster Korvain, she has spent her life preparing for a fight she never expected to come. When the Dominion — a vast empire built on conquest and soul-stealing magic — raids her temple and steals one of seven sacred relics that keep an ancient gate sealed, Itzil's world shatters in a single afternoon.

The relics are keys. The gate is a door. And on the other side of that door, something vast and hungry is pressing through.

Korvain sends Itzil into the world with a mission: gather allies. Build a team. Find the remaining relics before the Dominion does. She carries an obsidian token, a steel sword, and the faint, terrifying glow of golden light that has begun to manifest in her palms — the first sign of the Sun-Blade, a weapon of pure sunlight that hasn't appeared in three hundred years.

She finds Kaelen, a brilliant and bitter scout whose entire unit was wiped out by the Dominion. She finds Jagren, a dazzling arena fighter desperate for a purpose beyond applause. She finds Torvane, a quiet engineer whose countermeasures against the Dominion's technology have been ignored by every authority that should have funded them. And she finds Neyla, a healer working in refugee camps whose magic may hold the key to reversing the Dominion's most terrible weapon: the ash-oaths that erase human souls.

Together, they raid an enemy intelligence outpost, race to a coastal temple to secure a sacred relic, survive an encounter with the Dominion's most dangerous manipulator, and escape a war-beast assault that was never meant to kill them — only to measure what they could do.

By the end, the Sun-Blade blazes in Itzil's hand — not because she's perfect, but because she's clear about what she's fighting for. The team has proven itself. The war has begun. And the Dominion, led by the brilliant and terrifying Volzentar, is watching.

This is the story of a woman who was told she was chosen and didn't believe it. Who was given a weapon of impossible power and didn't trust it. Who built a team of broken, brilliant people and led them into the dark because someone had to go and she was the one who showed up.

The sun is rising. The blade is lit. And the world will never be the same.
