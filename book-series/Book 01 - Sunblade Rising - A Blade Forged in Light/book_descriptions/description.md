## Subtitle: A Blade Forged in Light

---

<b>She didn't ask to be chosen. The blade didn't ask for permission.</b>

<p>When the Dominion raids her temple and steals a sacred relic, warrior Itzil is thrust into a war she never expected — armed with a blade of pure sunlight that hasn't manifested in three hundred years and a prophecy she doesn't believe in.</p>

<p>The Dominion is hunting seven ancient relics that can open a gate sealed for centuries. On the other side: something vast, hungry, and patient. Itzil must gather allies, find the relics first, and become the leader the world needs — even though she's not sure she's the leader anyone wants.</p>

<p><b>In this book:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>A reluctant warrior discovers she can manifest a blade of golden light — and that the blade responds not to strength, but to clarity of purpose</li>
<li>A bitter scout, a flashy duelist, a quiet engineer, and a healer with impossible abilities join forces against an empire</li>
<li>A daring raid behind enemy lines reveals the Dominion's terrifying plans for the ancient Great Gate</li>
<li>A race to secure a sacred relic leads to a face-to-face encounter with the Dominion's most dangerous weapon: a woman who fights with words instead of swords</li>
<li>A war-beast assault tests the team's limits — and proves that showing up is the most powerful thing a person can do</li>
</ul>

<p>Sunblade Rising is an epic fantasy adventure that combines the warrior traditions of Mesoamerica with the disciplined philosophy of the samurai in a world where empires are built on stolen souls and the only weapon that can stop them is the courage to show up when everything says you shouldn't.</p>

<p>For fans of <i>The Poppy War</i>, <i>The Blade Itself</i>, and <i>The Name of the Wind</i> — a new epic fantasy series that proves the most powerful weapon isn't the sharpest sword. It's the person holding it.</p>

<p><i>The sun is rising. The blade is lit. And the war has only just begun.</i></p>

<p><b>Book 1 of 12 in the <i>Aztec Samurai Adventures</i> series. From Ketan Shukla, published by Metronagon.</b></p>
