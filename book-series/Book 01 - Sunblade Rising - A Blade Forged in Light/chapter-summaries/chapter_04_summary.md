# Chapter 4 Summary — THE PROPHECY SHE DOESN'T WANT

**POV:** Itzil

Amalura takes Itzil to the Hall of Embers — the deepest level of the temple — and reveals the Sun-Blade prophecy: when the relics are threatened, a bearer will arise who can manifest a blade of pure sunlight. Amalura believes Itzil is that bearer.

Itzil resists. She learns that the last blade-bearer, Solara, died sealing the Great Gate three centuries ago. The prophecy offers no guarantee of survival.

Later, Korvain confirms on the terrace that Solara had allies and didn't fight alone. He tells Itzil the blade-bearer wins because she has people worth fighting for. Itzil manifests the golden light again — stronger and longer than before — while sitting with Korvain in the moonlight.

**Key Events:** Prophecy revealed, history of Solara (last bearer), Itzil's fear of repeating Solara's fate, second stronger manifestation of golden light.

**Cliffhanger:** Korvain sees the light and says "Now we have something to work with."
