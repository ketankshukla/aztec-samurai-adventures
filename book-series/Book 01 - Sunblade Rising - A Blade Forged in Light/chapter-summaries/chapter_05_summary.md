# Chapter 5 Summary — FIRST LIGHT

**POV:** Itzil

Korvain delays Itzil's departure by four hours to conduct her first real Sun-Blade training. He teaches her the three requirements for manifestation: intention, clarity, and surrender. The blade doesn't respond to force — it responds to clarity of purpose.

Itzil finds her trigger: the memory of the fourteen-year-old boy in Solquetal who died trying to protect his sister. The Sun-Blade manifests as a crude but unmistakable weapon of golden light. She holds it for twenty seconds before it destabilizes.

By the end of three hours, she can manifest consistently for 30-60 seconds. Korvain explains that the blade stabilizes when the wielder finds a "defining purpose." She departs at noon with her escort, practicing nightly.

**Key Events:** First structured Sun-Blade training, Korvain's teaching on clarity vs. force, sustained blade manifestation achieved, departure from temple.

**Cliffhanger:** Itzil sleeps with golden light flickering in her palms — the blade is growing stronger.
