# Chapter 6 Summary — WHISPERS FROM THE DOMINION

**POV:** Volzentar

First villain POV. Volzentar receives the Ember Core in the Dominion throne room. He is revealed as intelligent, calculating, and theatrical — not a brute warlord but a strategic mastermind.

He briefs his inner circle: Nightshade (blood orator/intelligence operative) who organized the temple raid, and Dalrignon (portal engineer) who wants to integrate the Core into the mirror-network. Gravok (beast commander) requests permission for a full offensive on the border.

Volzentar learns that the Sun-Blade temple produced a bearer candidate — someone manifested sun-energy during the raid's withdrawal. He orders Nightshade to find and assess the bearer, not kill her. He wants to understand her before deciding how to respond.

**Key Events:** Volzentar introduced, Dominion inner circle revealed, Nightshade tasked with finding Itzil, Dalrignon plans portal expansion, Gravok deployed.

**Cliffhanger:** The Great Gate hums beneath the palace, and something on the other side whispers: "Soon."
