# Chapter 9 Summary — THE DUELIST AND THE ENGINEER

**POV:** Itzil

Two recruits in one chapter. Jagren is found in a warrior camp fighting pit — dazzlingly fast, flashy, and desperate for purpose beyond applause. He volunteers immediately but Itzil pushes back until he reveals genuine motivation: he wants to fight for something that matters.

Torvane is found at his border forge — quiet, precise, and carrying years of ignored countermeasure designs against Dominion technology. His ward-disruptors, explosive charges, and signal jammers have been rejected by every military authority. He joins when Itzil offers field testing.

That evening, the five-person team sits at a campfire for the first time. Itzil and Kaelen discuss strategy: they need to reach the Tide Pearl at the coastal temple before the Dominion does.

**Key Events:** Jagren recruited (duelist), Torvane recruited (engineer), team of five established, first strategic planning session.

**Cliffhanger:** Kaelen tells Itzil she needs to turn his intelligence into a plan — she's the first person who would use what he knows.
