# Chapter 10 Summary — THE HEALER'S BURDEN

**POV:** Neyla

First Neyla POV. She works in a refugee camp of 3,000 people, healing eighteen hours a day. Her family — mother, father, sister — were ash-oathed while she watched from behind a wall. She ran. The guilt drives her.

Itzil arrives and watches Neyla work for forty-five minutes before speaking. She offers Neyla something beyond camp work: the possibility that ash-oaths can be reversed. Amalura's theory suggests a healer with enough power could break the magic.

The idea of reversing ash-oaths — of getting her family back — transforms Neyla's decision from reluctant to absolute. She packs her medical kit, says goodbye to a young patient, and joins the team.

**Key Events:** Neyla's backstory (family ash-oathed), refugee camp described, recruitment via the ash-oath reversal possibility, team now complete at five.

**Cliffhanger:** Neyla walks forward with the team — the first honest thing she's done since running from her family.
