# Chapter 11 Summary — THE FIRST CAMP

**POV:** Itzil

The full team's first night together. Character dynamics emerge: Jagren and Torvane are oil and water (flash vs. function). Neyla is quietly competent. Kaelen watches the perimeter obsessively.

Strategic planning: Itzil proposes going after the Tide Pearl. Kaelen suggests a preliminary target — Thornspire, a Dominion intelligence outpost forty miles southeast. If they can access its records, they'll know the Dominion's relic plans.

Torvane reveals his ward-disruptor can suppress Thornspire's detection field for fourteen seconds. A plan takes shape: infiltrate, extract intelligence, get out.

That night, Itzil practices the Sun-Blade privately. Kaelen sees the golden light from the perimeter — his first glimpse of the blade. He says nothing but positions himself closer.

**Key Events:** Team dynamics established, Thornspire raid proposed, tactical planning, Kaelen sees the Sun-Blade for the first time.

**Cliffhanger:** Itzil realizes Kaelen saw the blade — and he chose not to mention it.
