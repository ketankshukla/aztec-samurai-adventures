# Chapter 17 Summary — THE BLOOD ORATOR

**POV:** Itzil

The team reaches the coast. The Dominion's thirty-person retrieval team is already at the coastal temple, struggling with Sun-Blade tradition wards. Worse: Nightshade has arrived.

Itzil enters the temple through a submerged sea-level passage while the team prepares a landward diversion. Inside the temple, she encounters Nightshade face-to-face.

Nightshade doesn't attack. She talks — with devastating accuracy about Itzil's fears, doubts, and the team's vulnerabilities. She offers a deal: surrender the blade, walk away, no one dies. Her words are weaponized truth, not lies.

Itzil refuses: "Kindness from you comes with chains." Nightshade attacks with blood-magic. Itzil instinctively manifests the Sun-Blade, which shatters the blood-magic attack. Nightshade retreats through a blood-portal, promising they'll meet again.

**Key Events:** Coastal temple reached, Nightshade encounter, blood-magic vs. Sun-Blade clash, Itzil refuses the deal, Nightshade's psychological warfare demonstrated.

**Cliffhanger:** Nightshade vanishes but has taken Itzil's full measure — and the inner sanctum still awaits.
