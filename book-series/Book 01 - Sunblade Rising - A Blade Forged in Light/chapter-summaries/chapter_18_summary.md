# Chapter 18 Summary — THE TIDE PEARL

**POV:** Itzil

Itzil reaches the inner sanctum. The Tide Pearl sits on a wave-shaped pedestal — small, luminous, pulsing blue-silver. When she takes it, a vision strikes: the Great Gate on the ocean floor, enormous, its ward-chains fraying. Something vast presses against the other side.

Outside, the team's diversion is in full effect — Torvane's explosives, Kaelen's coordination. Itzil exits through the flooded sea passage and reaches the rendezvous. Torvane collapses the approach road with delayed charges, buying their escape.

The smuggler's cart carries them north. Strategic assessment: Dominion has three relics, heroes now have one. Four remain unaccounted for. The team debates next steps — the Starshard in the Shattered Peaks is the logical target.

**Key Events:** Tide Pearl secured, vision of the Great Gate and VASTRIX's pressure, team extraction, road collapsed behind them, first relic in hero hands.

**Cliffhanger:** They have the first relic — but the race is far from over.
