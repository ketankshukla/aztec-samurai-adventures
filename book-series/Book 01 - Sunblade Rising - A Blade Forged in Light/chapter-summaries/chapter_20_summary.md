# Chapter 20 Summary — GRAVOK'S BEASTS

**POV:** Itzil

Gravok's war-beasts attack — five house-sized armored creatures with crimson eyes, controlled by blood-magic, led by Gravok himself. The team flees into a streambed heading for a gorge too narrow for the beasts to follow.

A beast drops into the streambed, blocking the path. Torvane's explosive charge cracks its armor; Jagren attacks with his stripped-down technique, wounding it enough to pass. A sorcerer-handler on the ridgeline fires bolts of crimson energy, wounding Neyla.

Itzil manifests the Sun-Blade instinctively — its golden light causes the beasts to flinch and refuse to advance. The dark magic controlling them can't overcome the blade's influence. The team reaches the gorge and escapes.

Itzil realizes this was a test, not an attempt to capture the relic. Someone (Nightshade) told Gravok where to find them. The hunt has become real.

**Key Events:** War-beast assault, Gravok introduced, Sun-Blade disrupts dark magic controlling beasts, gorge escape, team realizes they're being hunted.

**Cliffhanger:** The race has become a hunt — and they are no longer the hunters.
