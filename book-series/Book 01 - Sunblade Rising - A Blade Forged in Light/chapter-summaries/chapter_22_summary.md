# Chapter 22 Summary — RETURN TO THE TEMPLE

**POV:** Itzil

The team returns to Mount Solara. Korvain meets them in the courtyard and asks Itzil to demonstrate the blade. She manifests a fully formed, steady Sun-Blade and runs all thirty-seven guard positions — the best performance in three centuries. Korvain says one word: "Good."

Debrief with Korvain and Amalura covers everything: Thornspire, the coastal temple, Nightshade, the war-beasts. Amalura examines the Tide Pearl and confirms its authenticity.

Korvain plans two weeks of rest, resupply, and training for the entire team. He will train each member individually. Amalura pulls Neyla into the archives to study ash-oath reversal theory. Torvane redesigns his equipment. Jagren drills the simplified technique.

That evening, Korvain warns Itzil about Nightshade's intelligence capabilities and the Great Gate's increasing strain. The vibration is growing stronger.

**Key Events:** Temple return, blade demonstration impresses Korvain, full debrief, two-week training period begins, Gate strain worsening.

**Cliffhanger:** Korvain says "We may have less time than we thought."
