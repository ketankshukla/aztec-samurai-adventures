# Chapter 23 Summary — THE WAR COUNCIL

**POV:** Itzil

Full war council in the temple's main hall. Strategic picture: Dominion has three relics, heroes have one (Tide Pearl), three unaccounted for. The Starshard in the Shattered Peaks is the priority target. The Dominion's fifty-person retrieval team is already en route.

Amalura theorizes that the Tide Pearl might interact with the Starshard's wards — relics forged together share a resonance signature. Torvane has built a portable resonance amplifier to boost the signal.

Kaelen can get them there in twelve days through territory he's mapped. Each team member declares their readiness. Itzil asks Korvain for permission — he tells her she hasn't needed his permission for a while, revealing pride she's never seen from him before.

Itzil manifests the Sun-Blade in the hall and addresses the team: "We've been doing the impossible. Because we're the ones who showed up."

**Key Events:** Full strategic assessment, Starshard mission planned, Amalura's relic resonance theory, team declares readiness, Korvain's pride revealed.

**Cliffhanger:** The team prepares for their most dangerous mission yet — the Shattered Peaks.
