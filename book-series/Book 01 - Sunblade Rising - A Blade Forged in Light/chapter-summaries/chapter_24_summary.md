# Chapter 24 Summary — THE HORIZON BURNS

**POV:** Itzil

The night before departure. Itzil climbs to the temple's highest point and feels the Great Gate's vibration through the Tide Pearl. She can sense VASTRIX's pressure — something vast pressing against the seal.

Kaelen joins her. He shares his dead unit's names for the first time — all eleven, spoken like a prayer. He tells Itzil that being with this team is the first thing that's felt like fighting since the pass. The connection between them deepens — unnamed but undeniable.

Itzil says goodbye to Korvain. He tells her: "I didn't see something in you. I saw YOU." She leaves the Tide Pearl in his keeping.

At dawn, the team departs — eight people marching toward the Shattered Peaks. In the Dominion capital, Volzentar moves a chess piece and says "Interesting." The Great Gate hums. The Starless Crown turns invisibly above the world. And something vast whispers: "Soon."

**Key Events:** Itzil feels VASTRIX's pressure, Kaelen shares his unit's names, deepening bond, farewell to Korvain, team departs for the Shattered Peaks, Volzentar watches.

**Cliffhanger:** The team marches toward the Shattered Peaks. VASTRIX whispers "Soon." Book 2 awaits.
