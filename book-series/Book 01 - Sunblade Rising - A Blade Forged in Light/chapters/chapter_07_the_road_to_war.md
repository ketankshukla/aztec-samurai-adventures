Chapter 7 - THE ROAD TO WAR

Three days on the road changed Itzil in ways she hadn't expected.

The mountain paths gave way to valley roads, and the valley roads gave way to open country - rolling grasslands broken by copses of oak and elm, crossed by streams that caught the autumn light and threw it back in silver fragments. The land was beautiful in the way that vulnerable things are beautiful: temporary, exposed, one bad season away from ruin.

She walked with Venn, Tuli, and Sorren - her three junior warriors, each of them carrying packs that weighed more than they should have because Itzil had insisted on extra rations, extra water, and the small medical kit that Amalura had assembled. Better to be sore than sorry, she'd told them. They were sore. They were also, she suspected, sorry.

Venn talked constantly. It was his way of managing fear - a ceaseless stream of observations, questions, and tangential anecdotes that filled the silence the way sand fills a bucket: thoroughly and without discrimination. How far to Ashmark? What was the scout like? Had anyone ever seen a Dominion war-beast? Did Itzil think they'd see any war-beasts? He'd heard they were as big as houses. Were they really as big as houses?

"I don't know," Itzil said, for the eleventh time. "I haven't seen one."

"But you've read about them. In Amalura's texts."

"Amalura's texts describe them as 'varied in form and uniformly devastating.' Not the same as a size comparison."

"But if they're devastating, they must be big-"

"Venn." Tuli's voice cut through like a blade through cloth. She walked with the tight, controlled stride of someone whose shoulder wound had mostly healed but who was determined not to show that it still pulled. "Shut up."

Venn shut up. For about four minutes.

The road was not safe. Dominion patrols had been reported in the region - not the full military presence that occupied the eastern territories, but scout teams and courier riders moving along the trade roads. Itzil kept the group off the main paths, using the game trails and stream beds that paralleled the roads without exposing them to open ground.

She practiced the Sun-Blade every night after camp was set. Alone, in the dark, away from the others. Partly for privacy - the light was still unstable, prone to flaring and guttering in ways that would alarm anyone watching. Partly because the practice itself was intensely personal, a dialogue between her will and something she didn't fully understand.

The blade came easier each time. By the second night, she could manifest it in two seconds. By the third, she could hold it for three full minutes before her focus slipped. The golden light was warm in the cold mountain nights, and she caught herself thinking of it as a companion - the only thing in the world that responded to her emotions with perfect honesty.

She told no one about it. Not yet. The prophecy was Amalura's secret to share or not, and the blade was hers until she decided otherwise.

On the third day, they reached the frontier.

The frontier was not a line on a map. It was a feeling - a gradual shift from the relative order of the interior provinces to the fraying edges of civilization where central authority thinned and local necessity took its place. The towns were smaller here. The fences were higher. People looked at strangers the way they looked at storms: measuring, calculating, deciding whether to prepare or run.

Ashmark was the last outpost before the contested zone - a huddle of stone buildings and wooden palisades perched on a hilltop overlooking a river crossing. It had been a military outpost once, garrisoned by a full company of border soldiers. That was before the Dominion's advance had pushed the border back fifty miles and left Ashmark stranded in no-man's-land.

Now it was occupied by whoever was stubborn enough to stay.

Itzil led her group up the hill path at late afternoon. The palisade gate was open - not because the garrison was welcoming, but because several of the gate posts had rotted through and no one had repaired them. Inside, the outpost was a study in functional decay: buildings still standing, walls still mostly intact, but everything bearing the quiet neglect of a place that had been forgotten by the people who were supposed to maintain it.

She counted heads as she moved through the compound. A dozen soldiers, maybe fewer, in mismatched armor and with the hollow-eyed alertness of people who'd been on watch too long. A handful of civilians - refugees, probably, who'd washed up here when the tide of war had pushed them west. A few horses, thin and tired. A lot of empty space where a full garrison should have been.

She found the duty officer - a weary lieutenant named Hask who looked at her obsidian token with the flicker of recognition that said he knew what it was, followed by the flicker of doubt that said he wasn't sure it mattered anymore.

"Sun-Blade order," he said. "You're a long way from your temple."

"I'm looking for a scout. Kaelen. I was told he's stationed here."

Hask's expression did something complicated - a rapid transit through recognition, annoyance, exasperation, and something that might have been grudging respect.

"He's stationed here in the sense that he sleeps here occasionally and ignores every order I give him." He gestured toward the outpost's eastern edge, where a series of storage buildings backed up against the palisade wall. "Last I saw, he was in the observation post. Top of the grain store. He spends most of his time up there."

"Doing what?"

"Watching. He watches everything. And he sends reports - intelligence reports, troop movements, Dominion patrol patterns. He sends them to anyone who'll listen." Hask's voice carried the specific bitterness of someone who had tried to get those reports heard and failed. "No one responds. Not the regional command. Not the military council. Not the temple network. He's been screaming into the void for three months."

"Why?"

"Because his entire unit was wiped out three months ago. Eleven scouts, dead in a single night. Dominion ambush. He survived because he was on a solo patrol." The lieutenant's voice softened, fractionally. "He's the best scout I've ever seen. He's also the angriest. Be careful."

Itzil found the grain store at the eastern edge of the compound - a squat stone building with a flat roof accessible by an external ladder. She climbed. The roof was scattered with the detritus of extended habitation: a bedroll, a pack, a cold fire pit, bowls of dried food, maps pinned to a board with knife marks tracking patrol patterns. And sitting at the roof's edge, legs dangling over the side, looking east through a battered spyglass - a man.

He was younger than she'd expected. Mid-twenties, maybe. Lean the way wolves are lean - not thin but stripped of everything unnecessary. Dark hair cut short and practical. A face that was handsome in the angular, unsettling way that suggested its owner had never once used that advantage intentionally. He wore a scout's kit: dark leather, lightweight armor, a short bow slung across his back, and two knives at his belt positioned for speed rather than display.

He didn't look up when she reached the roof. He'd heard her climbing - she was certain of that. He simply chose not to acknowledge her until he was ready.

She waited. She would not speak first. Korvain had taught her that much about dealing with difficult people: let them come to you.

Thirty seconds. A minute. He lowered the spyglass.

"The duty officer sent you," he said. Not a question. His voice was flat, controlled, with an edge of mockery that came so naturally it might have been structural.

"Korvain sent me."

That got a reaction. Not much - a slight tension in his shoulders, a micro-pause before his next breath. But it was there. Whatever Kaelen felt about the world, he still respected Korvain.

"The old man sent a kid with a rock." He nodded at the obsidian token visible at her collar. "Impressive."

"He said you're the best tracker he's ever seen."

"He's right. I am."

"He also said you're arrogant and insubordinate."

"He's right about that too." Kaelen swung his legs off the edge and stood. He was taller than she'd expected, and he moved with the fluid, economic grace of someone whose body was a precision instrument. "So you're from the temple. What do you want?"

Itzil told him. Everything - the raid, the Ember Core, the relics, the Great Gate, the prophecy, the blade. Not the details of her own manifestation - not yet - but the strategic picture. The big shape of what was coming.

He listened without interrupting. His face was still. His eyes were not - they tracked her words the way a hawk tracks movement, quick and evaluative and missing nothing.

When she finished, the silence stretched.

"Why should I follow you?" he asked.

The question was blunt. No hostility - just a genuine need to understand.

She thought about what Korvain would say. What Amalura would say. What a great leader would say - something inspiring, something that made the blood warm and the spine straighten.

What came out was different.

"I don't know," she said. "But I'm going to fight either way. You can come or you can stay here and rot."

The mockery left his eyes. Something else replaced it - something harder to read. Not respect, exactly. More like interest. The kind of interest a scout shows when the terrain reveals an unexpected path.

"Your reports," she continued. "Three months of intelligence, sent to everyone who should care. No response. You've been doing the right thing and the world has been ignoring you. I won't ignore you. I need what you know. I need what you can do."

He stared at her for a long beat. The evening light caught his face - the sharp lines, the dark eyes, the tension around his jaw that said he was carrying something heavy and had been carrying it for a long time.

"Fine," he said. He reached for his pack - already packed, she noticed. He'd been ready to leave for weeks. Waiting for a reason.

"But I don't take orders."

Itzil picked up his bedroll and tossed it to him. "We'll see about that."

Something happened at the corner of his mouth. Not a smile. The ghost of a smile's distant cousin. There and gone.

He slung his pack. Checked his bow. Counted his arrows by touch.

"When do we leave?"

"Dawn."

"Good." He looked east, where the last light was fading over the contested territories. "Because the Dominion moved three battalions south yesterday. Whatever they're doing, it's starting."

Itzil followed his gaze. The eastern sky was darkening - not just with night, but with something else. A quality of shadow that felt heavier than it should. Somewhere beyond the horizon, the Dominion was marshaling its forces, and the war that had been building for years was about to stop building and start arriving.

"Then we'd better move fast," she said.

"That," Kaelen said, shouldering his pack, "is the first smart thing you've said."
