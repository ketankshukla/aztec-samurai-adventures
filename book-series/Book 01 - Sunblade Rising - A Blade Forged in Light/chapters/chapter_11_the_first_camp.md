Chapter 11 - THE FIRST CAMP

The five-person team made camp in a shallow valley between two ridgelines, sheltered from wind and hidden from the road by a stand of ancient oaks whose canopy was thick enough to mask a fire's light from overhead observation. Kaelen had chosen the site - he chose every site - with the methodical precision of someone who evaluated terrain the way other people evaluated furniture: by function, defensibility, and the probability that it would try to kill you.

It was their first night together. All five of them - Itzil, Kaelen, Jagren, Torvane, Neyla - plus the three junior warriors, arranged around a fire that Torvane had built with an efficiency that bordered on insulting. He'd used a device from his pack - a small brass cylinder that generated a controlled flame at the push of a button - and had the fire burning and stable in under a minute. Jagren had been trying to start his fire with a flint for ten minutes.

"That's cheating," Jagren said, watching the brass device disappear back into Torvane's pack.

"It's engineering," Torvane said. "The distinction is important."

"To you."

"To anyone who wants a fire before midnight."

The dynamic between them was immediate and chemical - oil and water, style and substance, flash and function. Jagren moved through the world like a performance. Torvane moved through it like a schematic. They were, Itzil suspected, going to drive each other insane. They were also, she suspected, going to make each other better.

Neyla had claimed a corner of the camp where the light was best and was inventorying her medical supplies with the focused determination of someone organizing their weapons before a battle. She laid out bandages, herb pouches, needle and thread, a small mortar and pestle, and a collection of tincture bottles that clinked together when she moved them. Everything was arranged by function: trauma supplies on the left, illness treatment in the center, magical augmentation on the right.

Kaelen sat at the camp's eastern edge, watching the perimeter. He hadn't stopped watching since they'd arrived. His eyes moved in a continuous sweep - treeline, ridgeline, sky, ground, treeline - the automated vigilance of someone whose survival had depended on noticing things before they noticed him.

Itzil sat at the fire's center and tried to feel like a leader.

It was harder than she'd expected. In the temple, leadership had been structured - Korvain above her, the disciples around her, the daily rhythm of training and study providing a framework she could lean on. Out here, there was no structure. No schedule. No one to tell her what to do next. There was only her judgment, her instincts, and the increasingly urgent need to turn five strangers into something that functioned.

"We need a plan," she said.

Five sets of eyes turned to her. Six, counting Venn, who was always paying attention even when he looked like he wasn't.

"The Dominion has three sacred relics. Maybe four. They need all seven to open the Great Gate. Our objective is to deny them the remaining relics - find them before the Dominion does and secure them." She pulled out Amalura's map and spread it on the ground. "The nearest confirmed relic location is here - the Tide Pearl, believed to be in a coastal temple in the southern reaches. After that, the Starshard, in a mountain fortress in the Shattered Peaks."

Kaelen leaned forward, studying the map. "The southern coast is two weeks' march. Through Dominion-patrolled territory the entire way."

"I know."

"And the Dominion will be heading for the same relics. They have the same intelligence we do - probably better, given their resources."

"I know that too."

"So we're in a race we can't win with a team we can't afford to lose." He sat back. "Just want to make sure we're all clear on the math."

Jagren, who had been listening with uncharacteristic patience, spoke up. "So don't race. Ambush. Let the Dominion find the relic, then take it from them."

"That's not-" Itzil started.

"No, wait." Kaelen held up a hand. His eyes had sharpened - the scout's brain engaging with the tactical problem. "He's not entirely wrong. If we go straight for the relic, we telegraph our intentions. The Dominion expects a race. They've planned for a race. What they haven't planned for is someone who lets them do the work and then takes the result."

"That's what I said."

"You said 'ambush.' I said it with more words and fewer hand gestures."

"Boys," Neyla said, without looking up from her inventory. The single word carried the weight of someone who had spent four months managing the competing needs of three thousand refugees and had no patience for ego.

The silence was immediate.

Torvane cleared his throat. "The strategic question is intelligence. We need to know what the Dominion knows: which relics they're targeting, when, and with what force. Then we plan around their plan."

"How?" Itzil asked.

All eyes turned to Kaelen.

He looked at the map. Looked at the territory markers - the Dominion patrol routes he'd documented, the outposts he'd mapped, the communication lines he'd identified during three months of solitary observation.

"There's a Dominion intelligence outpost called Thornspire," he said. "Forty miles southeast. It's a relay point - communications from the field pass through it on the way to the capital. If we can get inside and access their records, we'll know everything: relic locations, troop deployments, strategic priorities."

"How heavily defended?"

"Twenty soldiers. One sorcerer. A blood-mirror communication device connected to the high command." He paused. "It's doable. With five people and the right approach."

Itzil looked at her team. Kaelen, already planning entry routes. Jagren, ready to fight anything that moved. Torvane, calculating the sorcerer's ward strength. Neyla, packing her medical kit for field operations.

"All right," she said. "Thornspire. First real mission."

She caught Kaelen's eye across the fire. He gave a fractional nod - not approval, but acknowledgment. She'd taken his intelligence and made a decision. That was what he'd been waiting for.

They spent the evening around the fire in something approaching companionship. Not friendship - that would come later, if it came at all. This was the cautious, exploratory phase, the social equivalent of five animals sharing a watering hole: aware of each other, not hostile, but not yet trusting.

Jagren told stories. He couldn't help it - performance was his language, the medium through which he processed experience. He told them about his best fights in the pit: the duel against a man twice his size who'd fought with a hammer, the match against twin sisters who'd worked in perfect coordination, the time he'd won a bout while temporarily blinded by a thrown cloak.

"You lost a fight to a cloak?" Kaelen said.

"I DIDN'T lose. I won. While blind. That's the point of the story."

"The point of the story is that you didn't see a cloak coming."

"The point of the story is-" Jagren stopped. Processed. Grinned. "Fair point. I didn't see it. But I adapted. That's what matters."

Torvane examined a Dominion-issue arrowhead he'd found on the road, turning it in the firelight. "The metallurgy is crude. Iron core with a dark-steel coating. The coating is the dangerous part - it resists magical healing. A wound from this arrowhead would resist Neyla's magic."

Neyla looked up sharply. "Let me see." She took the arrowhead, holding it between her fingers with the delicate precision of someone handling a poisonous insect. She closed her eyes. Felt the metal with her healing sense.

"He's right," she said. "The coating is designed to interfere with biological magic. It wouldn't stop healing entirely, but it would slow it. Make treatment more difficult. More painful."

"Weaponized counter-healing," Torvane said. "The Dominion has invested significant resources into neutralizing magical support. They've thought about this."

The mood sobered. The Dominion wasn't just an army - it was a system, engineered from the ground up to counter every advantage their opponents might have. They'd thought about healing magic and built weapons to defeat it. They'd thought about scout networks and built intelligence to compromise them. They'd thought about defensive wards and built sorcery to breach them.

"They've had years to prepare," Itzil said quietly. "We've had weeks."

"Then we'd better be smarter than them." Kaelen's voice was flat, practical, stripped of everything except the assessment. "We can't out-resource them. We can't out-number them. But we can out-think them - if we use what we have instead of wishing for what we don't."

He looked at each person in turn. "A scout who knows their patrol patterns. An engineer who's built countermeasures for their specific technology. A healer who can treat what their weapons do. A fighter who's faster than anything they've got."

He looked at Itzil. "And a commander with a glowing sword and a talent for showing up when it matters."

She met his eyes. He held the gaze. Firelight and shadows and the first tentative filaments of something she couldn't name - respect, maybe. Or recognition. The feeling of being seen by someone who paid attention to everything and chose what to acknowledge.

"Dawn," she said. "We march for Thornspire."

"Dawn," he agreed.

The fire burned down to coals. The team settled into sleep - Kaelen taking first watch, because of course he did. Itzil lay in her bedroll and stared at the canopy of oak leaves above.

She practiced the Sun-Blade. Quietly. Privately. The golden light spilled from her palms and filled the space above her face with warm luminance, casting the oak leaves in gold and shadow. She held it for two minutes. Three. It was steadier every time.

At the edge of camp, Kaelen saw the light. She knew he saw it - he saw everything. His eyes reflected the gold for a moment, and his expression changed - not shock, not calculation, but something quieter. Something close to awe, held for half a heartbeat before he masked it and turned back to the perimeter.

She let the blade dissolve. Closed her eyes. Tomorrow was Thornspire. Tomorrow was the first test.

The team was five people, a fire, and a plan that was barely more than a direction. It wasn't enough.

It would have to be enough.
