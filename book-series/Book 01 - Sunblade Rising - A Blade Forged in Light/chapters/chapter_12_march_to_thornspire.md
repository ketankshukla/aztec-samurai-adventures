Chapter 12 - MARCH TO THORNSPIRE

The land changed as they moved southeast. Open grassland compressed into tighter terrain - ravines, rocky hillsides, stands of dense forest that blocked sight lines and channeled movement through predictable paths. Ambush country. Kaelen hated it.

He moved fifty yards ahead of the main group, as was his practice. The space wasn't arbitrary - it was calculated based on reaction time, sound propagation, and the average engagement distance of a Dominion patrol. Fifty yards gave him enough lead to spot a threat, signal the group, and have them react before the threat reached them. It also meant he was alone, which suited him in ways he didn't care to examine.

The forest floor spoke to him. Every broken twig was a sentence. Every scuffed patch of moss was a paragraph. The boot prints he found at the base of a stream crossing told him a twelve-person patrol had passed here within the last six hours - Dominion regular infantry, based on the tread pattern. They were moving northeast, away from Thornspire, which meant the outpost was currently lighter on manpower than usual.

Good. He filed the information.

He spotted a bird's nest disturbed at eye level - not by wind, which would have displaced it uniformly, but by a hand reaching through the branch at an angle consistent with someone checking a concealed message drop. Dominion field communications used physical drops in addition to their magical blood-mirror network. The drop was empty - already retrieved - but its location told him the communication route and the approximate schedule of the courier who serviced it.

He marked the location on his mental map. Another piece of the puzzle.

The group rested at midday in a declivity between two boulders that provided cover from three directions. Kaelen briefed them on what he'd found.

"The patrol that normally covers the Thornspire approach is currently deployed northeast. They won't be back for at least eighteen hours. That gives us a window."

"How do you know they won't be back?" Jagren asked.

"Because their boot prints show a full combat load - extra rations, heavier armor, communication crystals. That's a multi-day deployment, not a patrol loop. Something pulled them away from their regular route."

"Or they were redeployed to strengthen Thornspire's defenses because they know we're coming," Torvane said.

"Possible. But the boot prints are heading away from Thornspire, not toward it. And the message drop along the route was already serviced - the courier came through on schedule, which means the communication network is operating normally. If Thornspire had gone to alert status, the courier schedule would have shifted."

Itzil listened to the exchange with the focused attention she gave to every tactical discussion. Kaelen had noticed that about her - she didn't pretend to know things she didn't. She listened, processed, and then made decisions based on the best available information rather than on ego or assumption.

"What's the approach?" she asked.

He drew in the dirt with a stick. "Thornspire sits on a hilltop - a converted watchtower surrounded by a palisade wall. Single gate on the south side. The compound contains the tower, barracks, storage buildings, and a communication center where the blood-mirror is housed."

He tapped the drawing. "Twenty soldiers, one sorcerer. The soldiers rotate on four-hour watches - six on patrol, six on the wall, eight resting. The sorcerer doesn't follow the rotation. She stays in the communication center, maintaining the blood-mirror connection."

"She?" Neyla asked.

"The sorcerer is a woman. I've observed her through my spyglass during previous reconnaissance. Mid-thirties. Dark robes with silver trim - that's a mid-rank Dominion sorcerer designation. She's competent but not exceptional."

"How do you know she's not exceptional?"

"Because exceptional sorcerers aren't posted to relay outposts in the middle of nowhere. They're at the front. Thornspire is a bureaucratic assignment - important but unglamorous. The sorcerer assigned there is good enough to maintain the blood-mirror but not good enough to be needed elsewhere."

Torvane leaned forward. "The palisade wall. What's it made of?"

"Timber. Twelve-foot posts, sharpened tips, no walkway on the interior side. The soldiers patrol the wall by walking the exterior base."

"Ward-stones?"

"Four. One at each compass point, embedded in the wall posts. Standard Dominion defensive configuration - they project a detection field that triggers an alarm if anyone with hostile intent crosses the perimeter."

Torvane reached into his pack and produced a small brass device - one of his ward-disruptors. "Range on this model is thirty meters. If I place it within range of the ward-stones, it'll suppress the detection field for..." He paused, calculating. "Fourteen seconds. Maybe sixteen."

"That's not long."

"It's long enough to cross a twelve-foot wall if you know what you're doing." He looked at Kaelen. "Do you know what you're doing?"

"I've been crossing walls since I was twelve."

They reached the outskirts of Thornspire by late afternoon. The compound was exactly as Kaelen had described: a hilltop outpost surrounded by timber walls, with a stone watchtower at the center and a cluster of smaller buildings arranged around a packed-earth yard. Smoke rose from the barracks chimney. A flag - Dominion black and silver - hung limp in the still air.

Kaelen positioned the group in a tree line four hundred yards from the compound's southern gate. Through his spyglass, he counted the visible soldiers: four on the wall, two at the gate, scattered movement inside the compound. The numbers tracked with his previous observations, adjusted for the patrol's absence.

"The blood-mirror is in the tower," he said, passing the spyglass to Itzil. "Top floor. The sorcerer will be there. The intelligence we need - troop deployments, relic locations, strategic priorities - will be stored in the communication center on the ground floor."

Itzil studied the compound through the spyglass. "The plan?"

"Two-phase. Phase one: Torvane disables the ward-stones from outside the perimeter. Phase two: I go over the wall, access the communication center, retrieve the intelligence, and get out."

"Alone?"

"Speed and stealth. One person makes less noise than five. I can be in and out in ten minutes."

"And if something goes wrong?"

"Then phase three: you and Jagren hit the gate from the front. Draw the guards. Create chaos. I use the distraction to finish the extraction."

Jagren's eyes lit up. The prospect of hitting something was always well-received.

"What about the sorcerer?" Neyla asked.

"The sorcerer is the wild card. If she detects the intrusion, she can lock down the compound with blood-wards. We need her distracted or occupied."

"I can handle that," Neyla said. Everyone looked at her. She met their gazes with the steady calm of someone who had made a decision and was not interested in debating it. "I can't fight a sorcerer. But I can sense blood-magic. If she activates her wards, I'll feel it before it reaches full power. And my healing magic interacts with blood-magic in ways that might buy us time."

"Might?"

"I've never tested it in combat. But I felt the ash-oath on a villager once - my magic touched the sigil and the sigil reacted. Blood-magic is biological at its core. It uses the body's own systems as a medium. My healing magic accesses those same systems. There's... overlap."

Kaelen filed this information alongside everything else. A healer whose magic could interact with blood-sorcery. That was either an asset or a liability, depending on the circumstances. He'd take it.

"Dawn," Itzil said. "We hit Thornspire at dawn."

"Not dawn," Kaelen corrected. "Three hours before dawn. The guards are at their lowest alertness between the third and fourth watch rotation. Fatigue and routine create predictable gaps."

"Three hours before dawn, then."

He nodded. Packed his spyglass. Checked his weapons - the automatic inventory that was as much a part of his daily rhythm as breathing.

Through the trees, Thornspire's watchtower caught the last light of sunset. The blood-mirror at the top would be active now - transmitting reports, receiving orders, connecting this lonely outpost to the vast machinery of the Dominion's intelligence network.

In a few hours, that connection would be their window into the enemy's mind.

He settled against a tree and closed his eyes. Not to sleep - he rarely slept before an operation. But to enter the focused calm that preceded action, the state where his mind sorted through variables and possibilities and arranged them into sequences so precise that when the time came, his body would know what to do before his conscious mind caught up.

The team settled around him. Itzil sharpened her blade. Jagren stretched. Torvane calibrated his ward-disruptor. Neyla prepared medical supplies for potential casualties. Venn, Tuli, and Sorren checked their weapons and tried not to look nervous.

Tomorrow would be their first real test. Their first operation behind enemy lines. Their first chance to prove that five people - and three trainees - could reach into the Dominion's machinery and extract something useful without getting killed.

Kaelen opened his eyes. Looked at the watchtower. Looked at his team.

He didn't trust them yet. Trust was earned in action, not in campfire conversation. But he respected the potential. They were raw. They were untested. And they were here - which, in his experience, was the hardest part.

He closed his eyes again and began reviewing the approach route. Three hours before dawn. Through the ward-gap. Over the wall. Into the heart of the enemy.

Just another Tuesday.
