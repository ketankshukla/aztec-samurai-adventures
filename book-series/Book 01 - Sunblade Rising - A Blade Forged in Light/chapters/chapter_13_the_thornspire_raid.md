Chapter 13 - THE THORNSPIRE RAID

Three hours before dawn. The world was black and cold and perfectly silent.

Itzil crouched at the tree line with Jagren and Neyla, watching the compound through the pre-dawn darkness. The watchtower was a silhouette against the marginally lighter sky - a black finger pointing at stars that were beginning to fade as the earth turned toward morning. Torches burned at the gate and at intervals along the palisade wall, creating pools of amber light that threw the spaces between them into deeper shadow.

Torvane was already in position. He'd left thirty minutes ago, circling to the compound's northern side where the nearest ward-stone was embedded in the palisade wall. His ward-disruptor needed to be placed within thirty meters of the stone - close enough that anyone walking the perimeter might spot him. He'd gone without complaint, carrying his device in a padded case and moving with a silence that surprised everyone who assumed engineers were loud.

Kaelen was a ghost. He'd vanished into the darkness twenty minutes ago, moving toward the compound's eastern wall where the timber had been weakened by water damage - a vulnerability he'd identified during his months of observation. He was somewhere out there, invisible, waiting for Torvane's signal.

Itzil's job was straightforward: wait. If everything went according to plan, Kaelen would be inside and out before anyone noticed. If it didn't go according to plan, she and Jagren would provide the loudest, most attention-grabbing distraction they could manage.

She preferred the first option. She suspected she'd get the second.

Torvane's signal came at precisely the agreed time - a quick flash of light from his position, visible only from the tree line. The ward-disruptor was active. The detection field was down.

Fourteen seconds. Sixteen at most.

Somewhere on the eastern wall, Kaelen moved.

Itzil counted. One. Two. Three. She imagined him scaling the weakened section of palisade - finding handholds in the timber, pulling himself up with the fluid efficiency she'd seen in every movement he made. Four. Five. Six. Over the top. Landing on the other side in a controlled drop that absorbed impact through bent knees and forward momentum. Seven. Eight. Nine.

She stopped counting. He was either in or he wasn't. The next signal would tell her which.

The compound was quiet. The torch at the gate flickered in a breath of wind. A guard on the wall paused at the midpoint of his circuit, stretched, and continued walking. Routine. The most dangerous state for a sentry - the moment when pattern replaced awareness and the mind wandered to breakfast or sleep or the letter waiting at home.

Minutes passed. Long minutes, stretched thin by adrenaline and the particular flavor of anxiety that came from waiting while someone else took the risk.

Neyla touched Itzil's arm. "I can feel the blood-mirror," she whispered. Her eyes were half-closed, her expression concentrated. "Top of the tower. Active. There's a sorcerer connected to it - I can feel her life-force threaded through the device."

"Can you tell if she's aware of the intrusion?"

"Not yet. Her pattern is steady. Regular. She's maintaining the connection but not alert. Routine maintenance."

"If that changes-"

"I'll know before you do."

Inside the compound, Kaelen worked.

Itzil couldn't see him. Couldn't hear him. She knew he was in the communication center - the ground floor of the watchtower, where intelligence scrolls and maps were stored - because he'd told her that's where he'd go, and Kaelen did not deviate from stated plans.

She watched the guards. The wall patrol continued its circuit - seven minutes per rotation, four guards covering the perimeter. The gate guards stood in their pools of torchlight, talking in low voices about something that involved hand gestures and occasional quiet laughter. Off-duty soldiers in the barracks were silent - sleeping, presumably.

Everything was normal. Everything was fine.

Neyla's hand tightened on her arm.

"The sorcerer. She's shifting. Something's - she's not alarmed, but she's aware. Like she heard a sound she can't identify."

Itzil's pulse kicked. "Can you interfere?"

"I don't know. I've never-" Neyla closed her eyes. Her breathing changed - slower, deeper, more controlled. "I'm going to try something."

"Neyla-"

"I can feel the blood-mirror's connection. It's like a thread of red light running from the sorcerer to the device. If I can... soothe the connection. Make it feel normal. Like putting a hand on a nervous animal."

She reached out with her healing magic - not physically, but through the invisible landscape of biological energy that was her native territory. Itzil felt nothing, saw nothing. But Neyla's face smoothed, and after a moment she whispered: "Done. She's settled. Back to routine."

"What did you do?"

"I sent a pulse of calm through the blood-network. The sorcerer's nervous system interpreted it as the connection stabilizing after a minor fluctuation. It's like... telling her body that everything is fine."

Itzil stared at her. "You can influence a sorcerer's perception through her own magic?"

"Not influence. Reassure. There's a difference." Neyla opened her eyes. "And I can only do it because blood-magic is biological. It uses the body as a conduit. My healing magic accesses the same conduit. I just... whispered through it."

The implications were staggering. Neyla's magic didn't just heal. It communicated through the same channels that blood-magic used. If she could reassure, could she also disrupt? Could she sever the connection? Could she - and here Itzil's mind leaped ahead to the implication she hadn't dared voice - could she reverse an ash-oath by communicating through the magical conduit that held it in place?

Later. That question was for later. Right now, Kaelen was inside, the sorcerer was calm, and every second of calm was another second of opportunity.

The signal came eight minutes into the operation. A quick double-flash from the compound's eastern side - Kaelen was out.

Itzil exhaled. She hadn't realized she'd been holding her breath.

They waited. The compound remained quiet. The guards continued their rotation. The sorcerer, according to Neyla, remained in her routine maintenance pattern. Whatever Kaelen had done inside, he'd done it without leaving a trace.

He appeared at the tree line ten minutes later - materializing from shadow with the silence of someone who had learned to make the darkness a collaborator rather than an obstacle. He carried a leather satchel that hadn't been on his person when he'd left.

"Intel," he said. He wasn't breathing hard. He wasn't sweating. He looked exactly as he had before the operation, with the minor addition of the satchel and a look of grim satisfaction that suited his features the way victory suited a blade.

"Any issues?"

"The communication center was organized by date and category. Dominion bureaucracy is thorough - they file everything. I took the most recent strategic assessments, the relic-related intelligence, and the troop deployment orders for the current month."

"The sorcerer?"

"Didn't see me. She was on the top floor, connected to the blood-mirror. I was on the ground floor." He paused. "There was a moment when something in the tower shifted - a change in the ambient magic, like a current in water. Then it settled."

Neyla said nothing. Itzil said nothing. They exchanged a look that said: later.

Torvane collected his ward-disruptor and rejoined the group. The device was warm in his hands - the energy expenditure had heated the brass casing.

"Fourteen-point-three seconds," he said. "The ward-stones reactivated within expected parameters. No evidence of disruption visible to external monitoring."

"Clean?"

"Clean."

Itzil looked at her team. Five people. A successful infiltration of a Dominion intelligence outpost. No casualties, no alarms, no traces.

"Let's move," she said. "We need distance before dawn."

They melted into the forest. Behind them, Thornspire stood undisturbed - its guards patrolling, its sorcerer maintaining, its intelligence files lighter by several critical documents that no one would notice were missing until the next inventory. By then, the team would be fifty miles away.

They didn't stop until midmorning, when Kaelen declared the distance sufficient and found a defensible rest point in a rocky outcropping that provided shelter and sight lines.

Itzil spread the stolen intelligence on the ground. Scrolls, maps, encoded messages, tactical assessments. The team gathered around.

The picture that emerged was both better and worse than she'd expected.

Better: the intelligence confirmed that the Dominion had three relics, not four. The Heartstone from Brightfall was listed as "acquisition pending" - the temple had been destroyed, but the relic hadn't been found in the ruins. It was missing.

Worse: the Dominion had already dispatched relic-hunting parties to two confirmed locations - the Tide Pearl at the southern coastal temple and the Starshard in the Shattered Peaks. Both parties were well-resourced: soldiers, sorcerers, and specialized equipment for bypassing ancient wards.

The troop deployment maps showed the Dominion was massing forces in three locations simultaneously - the eastern border, the southern coast, and the central plains. A three-front strategy that suggested either overconfidence or a level of resources that made overconfidence irrelevant.

And there was one more piece of intelligence, buried in a routine communication from Thornspire to the capital. A reference to the raid on the Sun-Blade temple. A name.

"The raid was organized by someone called Nightshade," Itzil read. Her voice was steady, but the name sat in her mouth like something bitter. "A blood orator. She's described as-"

She stopped. Read the passage again.

"She's described as Volzentar's primary intelligence operative. She doesn't fight. She manipulates. She uses blood-magic not for combat but for persuasion - entering minds through the bloodstream, reading thoughts through biological resonance." Itzil looked up. "She's the one who planned the raid on our temple. She knew exactly where the vault was, exactly what protections it had, and exactly how to bypass them."

Silence around the intelligence spread.

"She's also been tasked with finding me," Itzil added. "The report mentions 'the Sun-Blade candidate.' Volzentar wants me found and assessed."

"Assessed," Kaelen repeated. Not a question - a processing of the word and its implications. "Not killed. Assessed."

"That's what it says."

"Which means they don't see you as a threat yet. They see you as a variable. Something to be studied before they decide how to respond." He met her eyes. "That's good. It means they're cautious. Cautious enemies make slower decisions."

"It also means they're watching. Nightshade - whoever she is - is looking for us."

The team absorbed this. The warmth of their successful operation cooled in the shadow of a larger truth: they were not anonymous. The Dominion knew the Sun-Blade temple had produced a candidate. They knew she was gathering people. They were looking.

Itzil rolled up the scrolls. Packed the intelligence. Shouldered her pack.

"We move faster," she said. "The Tide Pearl - the coastal temple. We intercept the Dominion relic-hunting party before they reach it."

"That's a race we said we couldn't win," Kaelen reminded her.

"Then we'd better run."

She sent a message to Korvain via the communication method Amalura had arranged - a sealed scroll carried by one of the temple's trained hawks, which Venn had been keeping fed and rested in a cage strapped to his pack. The hawk launched into the morning sky and turned north toward Mount Solara, carrying everything they'd learned.

Korvain's response, when it came, would find them on the road. Moving fast. Moving south. Toward the coast, and the temple, and the relic that might keep the Great Gate sealed for another generation.

But before Korvain's response came, another message would arrive - a warning about Nightshade, about blood-magic, about the woman who didn't fight with weapons but with words, and whose words were more dangerous than any blade.

That warning would come too late.
