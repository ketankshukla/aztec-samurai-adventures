# Dramatis Personae

## The Heroes

**ITZIL** — Commander. A young warrior of the Sun-Blade temple, chosen by a prophecy she doesn't believe in. Fierce, uncertain, determined.

**KAELEN** — Scout. The last survivor of a wiped-out reconnaissance unit. Fast, sharp-tongued, haunted by guilt.

**JAGREN** — Duelist. A flashy arena fighter who craves glory. Skilled with a blade but untested by real war.

**TORVANE** — Engineer. A quiet inventor who builds weapons and machines. Sees the world in systems and solutions.

**NEYLA** — Healer. A compassionate woman whose family was enslaved by ash-oaths. Her healing magic can touch things no one else can reach.

## The Elders

**KORVAIN** — The Last Grandmaster. Itzil's mentor. Seventy years old, still the finest swordsman alive. His body is failing but his mind is iron.

**AMALURA** — The Keeper of Lore. Ancient scholar of the Sun-Blade tradition. Sharp-tongued, brilliant, sees what others miss.

## The Dominion

**VOLZENTAR** — The Warlord. Supreme commander of the Dominion. Charismatic, theatrical, terrifyingly intelligent.

**NIGHTSHADE** — The Blood Orator. Volzentar's most dangerous operative. She doesn't fight — she talks, and people who listen don't come back.

**GRAVOK** — The Beast Commander. A mountain of a man who commands an army of war-beasts. Brutal, direct, relentless.

**DALRIGNON** — The Portal Engineer. A brilliant, amoral engineer who builds mirror-portals from stolen souls.

## The World

**THE SUN-BLADE** — A weapon of pure sunlight, manifested by the will of its bearer. The only weapon that can break the Dominion's dark magic.

**THE GREAT GATE** — An ancient portal sealed centuries ago. The Dominion seeks to reopen it.

**ASH-OATHS** — Dark magic that enslaves by burning a sigil into the victim's chest, erasing their will while leaving their body functional.

**THE DOMINION** — A vast empire ruled by Volzentar, built on conquest, ash-oath slavery, and the promise of order through control.
