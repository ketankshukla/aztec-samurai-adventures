# Chapter 1 Summary — THE EDGE OF SMOKE

**POV:** Itzil

Itzil trains with her mentor Korvain at the Sun-Blade temple on Mount Solara. Despite years of disciplined practice, she can't match his speed or instinct. Amalura, the temple's sharp-tongued Keeper of Lore, challenges Itzil's self-doubt and warns that the world is changing.

At midday, alarm bells ring from the village of Solquetal below. Dominion soldiers in black and silver armor are raiding the town — burning the market, killing civilians, and using a sorcerer to perform ash-oaths on villagers, erasing their minds and turning them into puppets.

Itzil races down the mountain and fights her first real combat, killing two Dominion soldiers. She witnesses an ash-oath being performed — a villager's eyes going blank as a crimson sigil burns into his chest. She realizes too late that the village attack was a diversion: the Dominion's real target was the temple itself.

**Key Events:** Itzil's training with Korvain, Dominion raid on Solquetal, first kills, ash-oath witnessed, temple breached.

**Cliffhanger:** Itzil looks up the mountain and sees Dominion operatives inside the temple — the raid was a diversion.
