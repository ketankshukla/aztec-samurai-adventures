# Chapter 2 Summary — FIRE IN THE VALLEY

**POV:** Itzil

Itzil races back to the temple to find the vault doors blown open by alchemical charges. The Ember Core — one of seven sacred relics that can open the Great Gate — has been stolen. Korvain and Amalura explain: the seven relics are keys to the Gate, and the Dominion may already possess three.

That evening, Korvain convenes a war council. He reveals that other Sun-Blade temples have fallen. He assigns Itzil the mission to leave the temple and gather allies — warriors with specific skills needed for the coming war. Her first target: a scout named Kaelen, stationed at a frontier outpost called Ashmark.

Amalura gives Itzil an obsidian token marking her as a Sun-Blade order representative, plus a journal of intelligence on the relics, the Dominion, and potential recruits.

**Key Events:** Discovery of the Ember Core theft, explanation of the seven relics and Great Gate, Itzil assigned the recruitment mission, Kaelen and Neyla named as targets.

**Cliffhanger:** Itzil asks Korvain "What if I'm not enough?" — he tells her she won't know until she tries.
