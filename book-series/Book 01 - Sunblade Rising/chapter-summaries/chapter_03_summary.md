# Chapter 3 Summary — THE EMBER CORE

**POV:** Itzil

Itzil visits the vault one final time before departure. Amalura presents a detailed map of all seven relic locations (confirmed and suspected). The Dominion has three relics; four remain in play. The Tide Pearl at a coastal temple and the Starshard in the Shattered Peaks are the most reachable.

Amalura also reveals that the Dominion may have captured a Sun-Blade scholar who knows relic locations. Itzil departs with three junior warriors (Venn, Tuli, Sorren) as escort.

That night, camping under the stars, Itzil holds her hands up in the darkness. Golden light flickers across her palms — brief, warm, unexplained. The Sun-Blade energy has begun to manifest.

**Key Events:** Full relic briefing, Amalura's intelligence map, departure from the temple, first manifestation of golden light in Itzil's hands.

**Cliffhanger:** Golden light appears in Itzil's palms for the first time — something extraordinary is happening.
