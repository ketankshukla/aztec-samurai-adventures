# Chapter 7 Summary — THE ROAD TO WAR

**POV:** Itzil

Three days on the road. Itzil practices the Sun-Blade nightly, improving her manifestation time and duration. The landscape shifts from mountain to frontier — smaller towns, higher fences, fearful people.

The team reaches Ashmark, a decaying frontier outpost. Lieutenant Hask directs Itzil to Kaelen — a scout who's been sending intelligence reports to everyone for three months with zero response. His entire unit was wiped out in a Dominion ambush.

Itzil finds Kaelen on a rooftop. He's sharp, arrogant, and deeply bitter. She tells him everything — the relics, the Gate, the prophecy. His recruitment pitch is honest: "I don't know why you should follow me. But I'm going to fight either way."

Kaelen agrees to join — he was already packed. He respects her honesty and the fact that she's the first person who actually came after reading his reports.

**Key Events:** Journey to Ashmark, frontier described, Kaelen introduced and recruited, his backstory (dead unit) established.

**Cliffhanger:** Kaelen reveals the Dominion moved three battalions south yesterday — whatever they're planning is starting.
