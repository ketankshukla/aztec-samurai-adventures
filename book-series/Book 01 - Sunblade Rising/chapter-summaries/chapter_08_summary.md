# Chapter 8 Summary — THE SCOUT

**POV:** Kaelen

First Kaelen POV. He assesses Itzil and the team with a scout's analytical eye. Flashback to his dead unit — eleven scouts, killed in a perfectly executed Dominion ambush in Thornwall Pass. He survived because he was on a solo patrol.

On the road, Kaelen demonstrates his tracking skills — reading footprints, bird behavior, and patrol patterns to detect and avoid a Dominion patrol (eight soldiers, one sorcerer). Itzil accepts his assessments without unnecessary challenge, earning his respect.

During a rest stop, they have their first real conversation. She tells him his reports were the most detailed tactical analysis she'd ever seen. The validation — someone finally reading and valuing his work — cracks his emotional armor slightly.

**Key Events:** Kaelen's backstory deepened, tracking skills demonstrated, Dominion patrol avoided, first real Itzil-Kaelen connection.

**Cliffhanger:** Kaelen acknowledges she's the first person who read his reports and came — a shift in his emotional wall.
