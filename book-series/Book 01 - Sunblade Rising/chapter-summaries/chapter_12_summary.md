# Chapter 12 Summary — MARCH TO THORNSPIRE

**POV:** Kaelen

Kaelen scouts the route to Thornspire, reading terrain with expert precision. He identifies a Dominion patrol that has left the area, creating a window. He briefs the team on Thornspire's layout: twenty soldiers, one sorcerer, a blood-mirror communication device.

The plan: Torvane disables ward-stones from outside. Kaelen infiltrates alone for speed. If things go wrong, Itzil and Jagren create a distraction at the gate.

The team reaches Thornspire and takes position. Kaelen maps the guard rotation, confirms the sorcerer's location, and identifies the communication center where intelligence is stored.

**Key Events:** Kaelen's tracking expertise showcased, Thornspire scouted, infiltration plan finalized, team positioned for the raid.

**Cliffhanger:** Sunset. The Starless Crown turns invisibly above. Tomorrow, they hit their first real target.
