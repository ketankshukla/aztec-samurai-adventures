# Chapter 13 Summary — THE THORNSPIRE RAID

**POV:** Itzil

The team executes the Thornspire infiltration at 3 AM. Torvane disables the ward-stones (14.3 seconds). Kaelen scales the wall and enters the communication center. Itzil waits with Jagren and Neyla as backup.

Critical moment: the sorcerer in the tower senses something. Neyla discovers she can interact with blood-magic — she sends a pulse of calm through the blood-mirror's biological connection, reassuring the sorcerer that everything is normal. This reveals Neyla's magic can communicate through blood-magic channels.

Kaelen extracts intelligence scrolls and exits cleanly. The team withdraws without triggering any alarms. The stolen intelligence reveals: the Dominion has three relics (not four), relic-hunting parties dispatched to two locations, and the raid on Itzil's temple was organized by someone called Nightshade.

**Key Events:** Successful Thornspire infiltration, Neyla's blood-magic interaction discovered, intelligence extracted, Nightshade named.

**Cliffhanger:** Nightshade has been tasked with finding Itzil — and the warning about her will come too late.
