# Chapter 14 Summary — ESCAPE FROM THORNSPIRE

**POV:** Kaelen

Dominion tracking beasts pick up the team's scent from the ward-stones' biological recording function. Kaelen identifies the pursuit: six beasts, twelve soldiers, one tracking sorcerer. He gives three options: outrun, fight, or use the river.

Itzil chooses the river. The team wades downstream through brutal cold water for twenty minutes, breaking the scent trail. Tuli's shoulder is aggravated. Jagren positions himself to shield her from the current.

They emerge on the far bank and escape through forest the pursuit can't navigate. At camp, Itzil organizes recovery while exhausted herself — earning Kaelen's deepening respect. He acknowledges she's the first person who read his reports and came.

**Key Events:** Pursuit by tracking beasts, river escape, team's first real danger together, Kaelen's growing respect for Itzil's leadership.

**Cliffhanger:** Kaelen realizes he's protecting something worth protecting — and the feeling terrifies him.
