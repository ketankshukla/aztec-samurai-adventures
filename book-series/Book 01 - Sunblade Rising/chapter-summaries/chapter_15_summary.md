# Chapter 15 Summary — THE INTELLIGENCE

**POV:** Itzil

The team analyzes the stolen Thornspire intelligence. Key findings: the Dominion has three relics (Ember Core, Voidglass, one other). The Heartstone from Brightfall is missing — not in Dominion hands. A thirty-person team is heading for the Tide Pearl. A fifty-person team targets the Starshard.

A captured Sun-Blade scholar named Varshan may reveal all remaining relic locations to the Dominion. Itzil sends a hawk message to Korvain with full intelligence.

Korvain's response arrives two days later: confirms everything, warns about Nightshade's blood-magic manipulation abilities ("people who listen don't come back"), and urges Itzil to practice the blade daily.

The team arranges transport via a smuggler network to reach the coast faster — six days instead of fourteen.

**Key Events:** Intelligence analysis, relic status confirmed, Korvain's warning about Nightshade, smuggler transport arranged.

**Cliffhanger:** The race for the Tide Pearl is on — and they're behind.
