# Chapter 16 Summary — THE BORDER CROSSING

**POV:** Jagren

First Jagren POV. He reflects on his life in the fighting pits — the first thing he was ever good at, the only place people saw him. He killed a Dominion soldier at Thornspire and threw up afterward. The reality of combat vs. arena fighting hits hard.

Kaelen teaches Jagren to strip his technique — removing the flashy flourishes that are beautiful but wasteful. Simplified forms make him significantly faster. The lesson is painful but transformative.

The team passes through a destroyed village — not burned but emptied. Every door marked with ash-oath sigils. Every person taken. Jagren finds a child's broken toy horse and places it on a windowsill. Something fundamental shifts in him: from fighting for glory to fighting to stop this.

**Key Events:** Jagren's backstory and internal transformation, combat technique stripped down, destroyed village as emotional catalyst, shift from glory to purpose.

**Cliffhanger:** Jagren asks Itzil to promise they'll make the Dominion pay. She corrects him: "Not pay. Stop."
