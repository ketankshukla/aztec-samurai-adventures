# Chapter 19 Summary — NIGHTSHADE'S REPORT

**POV:** Nightshade

Nightshade reports to Volzentar via blood-mirror. She confirms the Sun-Blade bearer is real, with resonance potentially exceeding historical records. She profiles each team member: Kaelen (best tracker she's seen), Jagren (exceptionally fast), Torvane (builds specific countermeasures), and Neyla — the one who concerns her most, because her healing magic interfaces with blood-magic channels.

Volzentar recognizes Neyla as the greatest threat to the Dominion's infrastructure — if she can reverse ash-oaths, the entire slave network is at risk. He orders Gravok's beast army deployed to test the team's capabilities before Nightshade's surgical approach is authorized.

Volzentar issues a kill order on Neyla: "She does not survive this war."

**Key Events:** Nightshade's assessment of the heroes, Volzentar's strategic analysis, Gravok deployed as a test, Neyla marked for elimination.

**Cliffhanger:** Gravok's beasts will be deployed within the week — the test is coming.
