# Chapter 1 — THE EDGE OF SMOKE

_POV: Itzil_

---

The training blade caught her across the ribs before she saw it move.

Itzil staggered back, sucking air through her teeth. The wooden sword had left a welt she could already feel swelling beneath her tunic, a hot line of pain that throbbed in time with her heartbeat. Across the courtyard, Korvain lowered his staff and regarded her with the patient disappointment of a man who had been doing this for fifty years.

"Again," he said.

She reset her stance. Feet shoulder-width. Weight centered. Blade angled across her body in the third guard position. She'd drilled this a thousand times. Ten thousand. She knew the form the way she knew her own breathing.

Korvain moved.

She didn't see the strike. She saw the aftermath — her training blade spinning across the flagstones, her hand stinging, and Korvain standing exactly where he'd been before, his staff resting at his side as though it had never moved at all.

"You're watching my hands," he said. "Stop watching my hands."

"Then what should I watch?"

"Everything. Nothing. You're fighting to not lose, Itzil." He stepped forward and picked up her training blade, turning it over in fingers that were gnarled with age but still precise as clockwork. "Fight to protect. There's a difference."

She wanted to argue. She wanted to tell him that she was trying, that she'd been trying for three years, that every morning she climbed the four hundred steps from the village to this temple courtyard and threw herself against his impossible skill until her arms shook and her lungs burned. She wanted to say: I am not good enough. She wanted to hear him disagree.

He handed the blade back. "Again."

The Sun-Blade temple sat on the shoulders of Mount Solara like a crown of white stone and golden tile. It had been there for centuries — since before the village of Solquetal had grown up along the river below, since before the trade roads had stitched the valley into the wider world. The temple was old in the way that mountains are old, in the way that rivers are old. It simply was, and had been, and would be.

Itzil had lived within its walls since she was six years old, when Korvain had walked into Solquetal's orphanage, looked at twenty children, and pointed at her. She'd never understood why. She was not the biggest or the fastest or the cleverest. She was stubborn, which was not the same thing as any of those, although Korvain seemed to think it might be better.

Now she was twenty-two, and the temple felt smaller every year.

She cleaned her training blade and hung it on the rack beside the others. Twelve warriors trained here. Twelve disciples of the Sun-Blade tradition, learning forms and philosophy and the old language of light-and-steel. She was the best of the twelve. Korvain said so, which was as close to a compliment as he ever came.

Being the best of twelve people in a temple on a mountaintop did not feel like being best at anything.

She walked to the eastern terrace and leaned against the railing. Below, Solquetal spread along both banks of the River Ilara — a town of clay-brick houses and tile roofs, market squares and workshop smoke, children running and dogs barking and ordinary life unfolding the way it had for generations. She could see the orphanage from here, a long building with a red door. She could see the mill, the smithy, the bridge. She could see the fields beyond the town, golden with late-harvest grain.

Everything she could see was peaceful. Everything she could see was safe.

She gripped the railing and breathed. The air smelled of stone and incense and the faint sweetness of the temple's gardens, where Amalura grew her medicinal herbs and her fury in roughly equal measure.

"Staring at the valley won't make it more interesting."

Itzil turned. Amalura stood in the terrace doorway — a woman of indeterminate age who might have been sixty or might have been a hundred, depending on how much she'd slept. She was small, sharp-featured, with a blind left eye that she'd lost to a fever decades ago and a working right eye that missed absolutely nothing.

"I'm not staring," Itzil said. "I'm thinking."

"You were staring. Thinking requires activity behind the eyes. I saw none."

Itzil bit back a response. Amalura was the temple's Keeper of Lore — its historian, librarian, scholar, and unofficial conscience. She had taught Itzil to read, to think critically, to ask questions that had no comfortable answers. She had also taught Itzil that arguing with Amalura was like arguing with the weather: technically possible, spiritually futile.

"How was training?" Amalura asked, settling onto the stone bench that overlooked the valley.

"He hit me. Twice."

"Only twice? You're improving."

"He's seventy-three years old, Amalura."

"And still faster than you. What does that tell you?"

Itzil exhaled. "That I need to train harder."

"No." Amalura's voice sharpened. "It tells you that speed is not the point. Korvain doesn't beat you because he's fast. He beats you because he's clear. His mind is still when he strikes. Yours isn't. You're clouded with doubt, girl, and doubt makes you slow."

"I don't doubt my technique—"

"You doubt yourself. Which is worse." Amalura folded her hands in her lap, the way she did when she was about to say something that would sit in Itzil's chest for days. "The others follow you because Korvain says to. Not because they believe in you. And you know it. And that knowledge eats at you like rust eats iron."

Itzil said nothing. There was nothing to say. Amalura was right. She was always right, which was the worst thing about her.

"Leadership isn't earned by being the best fighter in the room," Amalura continued. "It's earned by being the person who stays in the room when everyone else runs. You haven't been tested yet, Itzil. You don't know what kind of leader you are because nothing has asked you to lead."

"Maybe nothing will."

Amalura's working eye fixed on her — sharp, bright, unflinching. "Something will. I can feel it the way I feel weather coming. The world is changing, girl. Faster than you know."

The bells started ringing at midday.

Itzil was in the refectory, eating cold rice and pickled vegetables with three other disciples, when the sound cut through the quiet like a blade through cloth. Not the temple bells — those rang at dawn and dusk, steady and rhythmic. These were the village bells. The alarm bells. Fast, high, panicked.

She was on her feet before the second ring.

Through the refectory window she could see Solquetal below, and what she saw drove a spike of ice through her stomach. Smoke. Not chimney smoke — dark, oily, angry smoke rising from the eastern quarter of the town. And moving within the smoke, shapes. Figures in armor, black and silver, moving in formation through the streets.

"Soldiers," said Venn, one of the younger disciples, pressing against the window. His face was white. "Those aren't ours. I don't recognize the standard."

Itzil recognized it. She'd seen it in Amalura's history texts — a black field with a silver crown split by a vertical line. The Dominion. She'd read about them the way you read about storms in distant countries: with interest, with sympathy, with the quiet assumption that it would never come here.

The smoke was here now.

"Get Korvain," she said. Her voice was steady. She didn't feel steady. "Tell him the village is under attack. I'm going down."

"Itzil, we should wait for—"

"People are dying RIGHT NOW." She grabbed her blade from the rack — not the training sword, the real one, steel and leather, the one she'd carried for six years and never used on another person. "Get Korvain. Follow when you can."

She ran. Down the temple steps, four hundred of them, taking them three at a time, her boots striking stone in a rhythm that matched her heartbeat. Fast. Faster. The smoke grew thicker as she descended. The sounds grew clearer — screaming, the clash of metal, the terrible sound of wood cracking as buildings burned.

She burst through the tree line at the base of the mountain and into the outskirts of Solquetal. The eastern market was ablaze. Stalls overturned, awnings burning, produce scattered across cobblestones slick with something she didn't want to identify.

And the soldiers. Dominion soldiers in black plate armor with silver trim, moving with the disciplined precision of men who had done this many times before. They carried straight swords and round shields and the absolute confidence of people who expected no resistance.

Itzil ran toward the nearest group — three soldiers herding a family toward the town square. The family was screaming. The soldiers were not. That was the worst part. They were silent, professional, efficient.

She hit the first soldier from behind. Her blade found the gap between his shoulder plates and bit deep. He went down with a grunt of surprise, and the other two turned toward her.

She'd never fought a real opponent before. Not someone trying to kill her. The difference between training and combat was the difference between swimming in a river and swimming in the sea — theoretically similar, practically a different universe.

The second soldier swung at her head. She froze. Three heartbeats. An eternity compressed into the space between one breath and the next, her body locked, her mind screaming RUN and FIGHT and DO SOMETHING in a chaos of contradictions.

Instinct won. She ducked. The blade passed over her head close enough to part her hair. She came up inside his guard and drove her sword into his side. He folded. She pulled the blade free and turned to the third soldier, but he was already running.

Her hands were shaking. She looked at them — her fingers, wrapped around the leather grip, trembling like leaves in wind. There was blood on the blade. There was blood on her hands. She'd killed two men. The world had not prepared her for how easy it was, or how awful it felt.

The family was gone — fled into the smoke. Good. She moved deeper into the town.

What she found was worse than the burning.

In the town square, a Dominion sorcerer — robed in black, hands glowing with a dull crimson light — was pressing his palm against the chest of a kneeling villager. Where his hand touched, a sigil burned itself into the villager's skin. The man screamed — a raw, animal sound that clawed at the inside of Itzil's skull. Then the scream stopped. The man's eyes went blank. Empty. Like windows with the curtains drawn. He stood, picked up a dropped sword, and turned toward his own neighbors with the mechanical purpose of a puppet on strings.

Ash-oath. She'd read about this. She'd never seen it. The reading had not prepared her for the reality — the human being erased in front of her eyes, the body remaining but the person inside gone, replaced by obedience.

She wanted to vomit. She wanted to scream. She wanted to run back up the four hundred steps to the temple and hide in the refectory and pretend none of this was happening.

Instead, she raised her sword and charged the sorcerer.

He saw her coming. A flick of his wrist sent a bolt of crimson energy that she barely dodged, the heat of it scorching her sleeve. She closed the distance — three steps, two, one — and swung.

The sorcerer deflected with a shield of dark light. Her blade rebounded. He smiled — a thin, professional smile — and gathered energy for another strike.

An arrow took him through the throat.

He dropped. Behind Itzil, three of the temple disciples emerged from the smoke, bows drawn. Venn was among them. "Korvain's coming," he said. "He said to hold until he arrives."

Itzil nodded. She couldn't speak. The ash-oathed villager was still standing in the square, sword in hand, eyes empty, waiting for orders that would never come from his dead master. She didn't know how to undo it. She didn't know if it could be undone.

She fought on. Through the streets, house by house, corner by corner. The Dominion soldiers were pulling back — not in panic but in orderly retreat. They'd gotten what they came for. She could see it now: the attack on the village wasn't the point. It was loud, visible, terrifying. It drew attention downhill.

Away from the temple.

The realization hit her like Korvain's staff across the ribs.

She turned and looked up the mountain. Through the smoke, through the haze, she could see the temple. The doors were open. Figures moved inside — black and silver.

The Dominion hadn't come for the village. They'd come for the temple.

And she'd left it undefended.
