# Chapter 2 — FIRE IN THE VALLEY

_POV: Itzil_

---

She ran back through the burning streets with her lungs aching and her mind screaming a single word: *temple*.

The four hundred steps had never felt so long. She took them two at a time, her thighs burning, her breath coming in ragged gasps that tasted of smoke and copper. Below her, Solquetal burned. Above her, the temple waited — violated, breached, its doors thrown open like a wound.

Three disciples ran with her. Venn, who was fast and scared. Marek, who was neither. And Tuli, who had an arrow wound in her shoulder and was running anyway because Tuli did not know how to stop.

They reached the temple courtyard to find it empty. No soldiers. No fighting. Just silence and open doors and the faint smell of something chemical — an alchemical accelerant, the kind used to burn through wards.

"The vault," Itzil said. "They went for the vault."

The inner vault sat at the heart of the temple, behind three locked doors and a series of protective wards that Amalura had maintained for decades. It held the temple's most sacred artifacts: scrolls, weapons, relics from the Sun-Blade tradition's earliest days. Most were historical curiosities — interesting to scholars, worthless to soldiers.

Most. Not all.

They found the vault doors blown open. The locks had been melted — not picked, not forced, but dissolved by concentrated dark magic that left the metal edges glowing dull orange. The wards were shattered, their remnants hanging in the air like broken spiderwebs made of light.

Inside, the vault was undisturbed — shelves of scrolls and artifacts sitting in their places, untouched. All except one.

The pedestal at the vault's center was empty.

Itzil stared at it. She knew what had sat there. Everyone in the temple knew. The Ember Core — a relic the size of a human fist, a sphere of crystallized sun-energy that pulsed with warm golden light. It had been in this vault for four hundred years, placed here by the temple's founders, protected by every generation since.

It was gone.

"They didn't come for the village," Venn whispered. His face was ashen in the vault's dim light. "The raid was—"

"A diversion." Itzil's voice was flat. She could feel something building behind her sternum — not grief, not fear. Anger. The cold, heavy kind that settles into bone and stays. "They burned Solquetal to distract us while operatives hit the vault."

Footsteps in the corridor behind them. Itzil spun, blade raised.

Korvain stood in the vault doorway. He'd climbed the four hundred steps at his own pace, which was slow and steady and arrived when it arrived. He leaned on his staff, his breathing even despite the climb. His eyes swept the vault — the blown doors, the broken wards, the empty pedestal.

He was calm. That was the thing about Korvain. The world could catch fire and he would be calm — not because he didn't care, but because panic had never once in his life solved a problem.

"The Ember Core," he said. Not a question.

"Gone."

He nodded. Stepped into the vault. Ran his fingers along the broken ward-traces, reading them the way Itzil might read footprints. "Professional work. Precise. They knew exactly what they were looking for and exactly how to get past the protections." He paused at the pedestal. "This was not a raid, Itzil. This was planned. Weeks in advance. Maybe months."

"By who?"

"By someone who knows what the Ember Core is and what it can do." He turned to face her. In the vault's low light, the lines on his face were deep shadows, and his eyes — still sharp, still clear, still carrying the weight of seven decades of knowledge — held something she had never seen in them before.

Gravity. Not concern. Not fear. Something heavier than either.

"Sit down," he said. "All of you."

They sat on the vault floor — Itzil, Venn, Marek, Tuli with her wounded shoulder. Korvain lowered himself onto a stone bench with the careful, deliberate movements of a man whose joints had opinions about every position.

"The Ember Core is one of seven sacred relics," he said. "Each one amplifies sun-magic. Individually, they're powerful. Together..." He paused. Chose his words with the precision he applied to everything. "Together, they can open the Great Gate."

Silence. Even Venn, who talked through earthquakes, said nothing.

"The Great Gate was sealed centuries ago," Korvain continued. "Before this temple was built. Before Solquetal existed. It is a portal — a doorway between our world and another. What exists on the other side of that doorway is... debated among scholars. Amalura knows more than I do. What is not debated is this: the Gate was sealed for a reason. Whatever is on the other side should not be on this side."

"And the relics can open it," Itzil said.

"With sufficient power and all seven in one place, yes. The relics are the keys. The Gate is the lock." He looked at the empty pedestal. "Someone just stole one of the keys."

The sound of rapid footsteps echoed down the corridor. Amalura burst into the vault — not burst, precisely, because Amalura did not burst anywhere. She arrived with velocity and purpose, which was different. Her face was pale. Her one good eye was wide.

"I felt it," she said. "The moment they took it. I felt it like a hand reaching into my chest." She pressed her palm against the empty pedestal. Her fingers trembled. "That relic has been in this temple for four hundred years. Whoever took it knows exactly what they're doing."

"How many relics does the enemy have?" Itzil asked.

Amalura and Korvain exchanged a look. The kind of look that contained an entire conversation compressed into a single glance.

"We don't know for certain," Amalura said carefully. "The seven relics were scattered across the continent after the Gate was sealed. Hidden in temples, buried in ruins, protected by wards. Over the centuries, some have been... lost. Records conflict."

"Best guess," Itzil pressed.

Another look between them. Korvain answered. "Before today, intelligence suggested the Dominion had acquired two relics. With the Ember Core, that makes three."

Three of seven. Almost half.

"How long before they find the rest?"

Korvain straightened on his bench. The movement cost him — she could see it in the tightness around his eyes, the way his left hand pressed against his knee. But his voice was iron.

"That depends on how organized they are and how much they know. If they've been planning this — and the precision of today's raid suggests they have — then they already know where at least some of the remaining relics are." He met her eyes. "This was not a raid. This was a declaration of war."

The hours after the attack were a blur of fires extinguished, wounded tended, and dead counted.

Solquetal had lost eleven people. Eleven names that Itzil had known since childhood — shopkeepers, farmers, a schoolteacher, a fourteen-year-old boy who'd been trying to protect his sister. The Dominion soldiers had killed with efficiency and without malice, which somehow made it worse. They hadn't come to terrorize. They'd come to distract. The deaths were incidental — arithmetic, not cruelty.

Seven villagers had been ash-oathed. They stood in the town square now, blank-eyed and motionless, waiting for commands from a dead sorcerer. No one knew what to do with them. No one knew how to undo what had been done. Neyla's mother was among them — but Neyla didn't live here anymore. She'd left years ago to work in refugee camps on the border. Itzil didn't know if anyone had sent word.

The temple's other disciples had arrived during the fighting and helped drive the Dominion soldiers out of Solquetal. The enemy retreated southeast, moving fast, carrying the Ember Core with them. By the time the fires were out, they were gone.

Korvain convened a council in the temple's main hall that evening. Itzil, Amalura, and the senior disciples sat on cushions around a low table while rain — the season's first — drummed against the roof tiles and ran in silver streams down the courtyard stones.

"The Dominion has been expanding for years," Korvain said. "Territory by territory, kingdom by kingdom. I've received reports from other Sun-Blade temples — some have already fallen. Others have gone silent. We may be one of the last still standing."

"And now they've found us," Amalura added. "This temple will not be left alone. They'll come back. In force."

"Then we prepare," said Marek, one of the older disciples. "Fortify the temple. Train harder. Build defenses."

Korvain shook his head. "Twelve warriors cannot defend a mountain temple against an empire. We don't need walls, Marek. We need allies."

He turned to Itzil. The weight of his gaze settled on her like a hand on her shoulder — heavy, deliberate, meaningful.

"You need to leave the temple, Itzil."

She blinked. "Leave?"

"There are people across this continent who can fight. Warriors, scouts, engineers, healers. People with skills we need and conviction we can trust. But they won't come to us. Someone has to go to them."

"Send one of the senior disciples—"

"I'm sending you."

The table went quiet. Rain filled the silence.

"Korvain, I'm not—"

"You are the best fighter in this temple. You are the best tactician. And you have something the others don't."

She waited. He didn't elaborate.

"What?"

"Stubbornness." For the first time since the attack, something like humor touched the corners of his eyes. "The kind that doesn't know when it's beaten. That's not a weakness, Itzil. In what's coming, it may be the only thing that matters."

Amalura cleared her throat. "He's right. And I'm saying that under protest, because agreeing with Korvain is against my policy." She reached into her robes and produced something — a palm-sized token of carved obsidian, smooth and black, with a sun-and-blade sigil etched into its surface. "Take this. It marks you as a representative of the Sun-Blade order. Anyone who recognizes it will know you speak with temple authority."

Itzil took the token. It was cold and surprisingly heavy for its size. She turned it over in her fingers, feeling the grooves of the sigil.

"Where do I go?" she asked.

"There's a frontier outpost called Ashmark," Korvain said. "Three days east. A scout is stationed there — one of the best I've ever seen. His name is Kaelen." Something flickered across his face — an expression that might have been fond exasperation. "He's arrogant, insubordinate, and the best tracker I've ever encountered. You'll hate him."

"And yet you want me to recruit him."

"I want you to convince him that the world is worth fighting for. Which may be the harder task." He paused. Leaned forward. "He lost his entire unit three months ago. He's been sending intelligence reports to anyone who'll listen. No one responds. He's bitter, Itzil. Bitter and brilliant. That's a dangerous combination — and a useful one."

Itzil looked at the obsidian token. At Korvain. At Amalura. At the rain streaming down the windows of the hall where she'd spent most of her life.

"When do I leave?"

"Dawn," Korvain said. "The road gets more dangerous every day."

She nodded. Stood. Walked to the door of the hall, then stopped and turned back.

"Korvain."

"Yes?"

"What if I'm not enough?"

He looked at her for a long time. Rain and lamplight. The oldest warrior she knew, sitting in the temple where he'd spent his life, sending his best student into a war she didn't understand.

"You won't know until you try," he said. "But I chose you for a reason, Itzil. I chose you because when you get hit, you get up. Every time." He folded his hands on the table. "Now get some sleep. You have a long walk ahead of you."

She left. In the corridor, she pressed her back against the wall and closed her eyes. Her hands were still shaking — not from the fight, but from everything after. The dead. The oathed. The empty pedestal. The weight of a token in her pocket and a task she didn't know how to carry.

She stood there for a long time. Then she opened her eyes, straightened her spine, and walked to her room.

Sleep did not come easily. But it came.
