# Chapter 3 — THE EMBER CORE

_POV: Itzil_

---

She climbed the steps to the vault at dawn, before anyone else was awake.

The blown doors had been propped shut with timber braces, but the locks were gone and the wards were dead, so the gesture was symbolic at best. She pushed through and stood in the dim interior, surrounded by shelves of scrolls and artifacts that suddenly felt fragile in a way they hadn't before.

The empty pedestal caught the first light of morning through the vault's single high window. A beam of gold fell across the bare stone surface where the Ember Core had sat for four centuries. She could see the faint circular outline where the relic had rested — a slight discoloration in the stone, like a tan line on skin. Evidence of something that had been there so long its absence felt wrong.

She heard footsteps behind her. Measured, deliberate, accompanied by the soft tap of a staff.

"I thought I'd find you here," Korvain said.

"I wanted to see it one more time before I left."

He stood beside her, both of them looking at the empty pedestal. The silence was the comfortable kind — the silence of two people who had spent years training together and didn't need words to fill the space between thoughts.

"Tell me about the relics," she said. "All of them. Everything you know."

Korvain settled onto the stone bench along the wall, his knees protesting audibly. He arranged his staff across his lap — a weapon he'd carried for forty years, a length of ironwood capped with a short blade at one end that he could deploy faster than most warriors could draw a sword.

"Seven relics," he began. "Forged at the same time as the Great Gate, using the same techniques. They were designed as keys — each one a piece of the mechanism that controls the Gate's opening and closing. Individually, they amplify sun-magic. Together, they provide the energy to activate the Gate."

"And the Dominion wants to open it."

"That appears to be the plan. Though what they expect to find on the other side..." He shook his head. "The historical record is conflicted. Some texts describe the realm beyond the Gate as a dimension of pure energy — dangerous but potentially useful. Others describe it as something worse. A place where consciousness exists without form. Where hunger is the only law."

"Which version do you believe?"

"I don't believe either. I deal in what I know, and what I know is this: the Gate was sealed by people who understood it far better than we do. They sealed it at enormous cost — lives were lost in the sealing. They did not do that lightly."

Footsteps in the corridor. Faster than Korvain's, sharper than Itzil's. Amalura swept into the vault with the energy of someone who had been awake for hours and had opinions about all of them.

"Good. You're both here. That saves me a trip." She carried a leather satchel over one shoulder and a look on her face that suggested the satchel contained answers to questions Itzil hadn't thought to ask yet.

She set the satchel on the pedestal — right where the Ember Core had been — and began pulling out scrolls, tablets, and hand-drawn maps. Within minutes, the pedestal was buried under paper.

"I've been in the archives since midnight," she said. "Cross-referencing every mention of the seven relics across four centuries of temple records. Here's what I know."

She unrolled a map — hand-drawn, annotated in three different inks, covered in Amalura's precise handwriting. The continent spread before them: mountain ranges, coastlines, forests, cities. Seven points were marked with gold circles.

"The seven relics. Their last known locations, as of the most recent records I could find." She pointed to each in turn. "The Ember Core — stolen, now in Dominion hands. The Tide Pearl — believed to be in a coastal temple in the southern reaches. The Starshard — hidden in a mountain fortress in the Shattered Peaks. The Heartstone, the Voidglass, the Sunheart, and the Dawnchain — locations increasingly uncertain. Some of these records are decades old. Others are centuries."

"How many does the Dominion have?"

"Three confirmed, including ours. Possibly a fourth." She tapped a location in the eastern plains. "The temple at Brightfall went dark six months ago. If the Dominion took it, they likely have the Heartstone as well."

Itzil studied the map. The gold circles were scattered across the continent — no pattern, no cluster. Deliberate. Whoever had hidden the relics centuries ago had spread them as far apart as possible.

"If we can reach the remaining relics before the Dominion does, we deny them the keys," she said.

"Correct," Korvain said. "But we can't search for relics and fight a war at the same time. Not with twelve warriors and two old scholars."

"Which is why you're gathering allies," Amalura said to Itzil. "Not just fighters. People with specific skills. A scout who can navigate hostile territory. An engineer who can build defenses. A healer who can—" She stopped. Pressed her lips together.

"Who can what?" Itzil asked.

"The ash-oaths," Amalura said, her voice softer now. "What you saw yesterday — the villagers, their eyes going blank. That magic is not new. It's ancient. And there are... theoretical references in the oldest texts to a form of healing that might counter it. But I've never seen it demonstrated. It would require a healer of extraordinary power and precision."

"Do we know anyone like that?"

"There are rumors. A woman working in refugee camps near the eastern border. She treats people the Dominion has discarded — wounded, displaced, damaged. Her name comes up in reports from travelers. They say she can do things with healing magic that shouldn't be possible."

"Her name?"

"Neyla."

Itzil filed the name alongside Kaelen's. Two names. A scout and a healer. The beginning of something she couldn't yet see the shape of.

She left at dawn, as Korvain had instructed.

Her pack contained three days' food, a water skin, a bedroll, a map, and the obsidian token. Her blade hung at her hip — cleaned, sharpened, still carrying the weight of yesterday's kills in the way the steel seemed fractionally heavier than it had been before. She knew the weight was imaginary. She also knew it would never fully leave.

Korvain met her at the temple gate. The morning light caught his white hair and turned it gold. He looked old in that light — genuinely, undeniably old in a way that he could usually mask with his bearing and his iron will. She realized, with a sensation like stepping off a cliff, that she had no idea how much time he had left.

"Listen to me," he said. His voice was low, meant only for her. "What you're doing — leaving this temple, gathering people, building something — this is not what I trained you for. I trained you to fight. What you need to do now is lead. They are not the same skill."

"You've told me that."

"I'm telling you again because you haven't heard it yet." He placed his hand on her shoulder — a gesture he almost never made. His grip was still strong despite the tremors that plagued his fingers when he was tired. "A leader who never leaves home is not a leader. She's a guard. You need to go out there and find people worth fighting beside. Then you need to convince them that the fight is worth having."

"And if they don't listen?"

"Then be stubborn. It's your finest quality." He released her shoulder. Stepped back. "Go. I'll be here when you return."

Amalura was waiting at the head of the path that wound down the mountain's far side — the back route, avoiding Solquetal and the roads the Dominion might be watching. She pressed a small leather journal into Itzil's hands.

"Notes," she said. "Everything I know about the relics, the Gate, the Dominion's command structure, and the people you're going to find. Read it on the road. Memorize what matters. Burn the rest."

"Thank you, Amalura."

"Don't thank me. Come back alive. That's thanks enough." She paused. Looked at Itzil with her one good eye — the eye that had seen more of the world than most people's two. "You're going to doubt yourself out there. Every day, probably every hour. That's normal. Doubt is the mind testing its own assumptions. The people who never doubt are the ones you should worry about."

Itzil nodded. Tucked the journal into her pack. Turned to the path.

Three junior warriors fell in behind her — Venn, Tuli, and a quiet young man named Sorren who was solid with a blade and didn't talk much. Korvain had assigned them as her escort. They looked nervous, excited, and very young.

The path wound down the mountain through pine forests and switchbacks. Below, the world opened up — valleys, rivers, distant mountains, and somewhere beyond them, a continent at war. She could feel it now — the pull of something larger than herself, larger than the temple, larger than anything she'd imagined. The world was changing, Amalura had said. Faster than you know.

She walked.

The mountain fell away behind her. The temple shrank to a speck of white stone on a green shoulder. The air changed — pine to dust, mountain to valley, home to everywhere else.

That night, camped under a sky thick with stars, she lay on her back and stared upward. Her body ached from the march. Her mind ached from everything else.

She held her hands up in the darkness. Open palms, fingers spread. She thought about the ash-oathed villagers. The sorcerer's crimson fire. The way Korvain's staff had always seemed faster than physics should allow.

She thought about what Amalura had said: the Sun-Blade tradition was built on the principle that sunlight could be channeled through will. That the right person, with the right clarity of purpose, could manifest light as a physical force. Could project it through their hands, shape it into a blade of pure golden energy.

It was the foundational skill of the order. Every disciple trained toward it. None of the current twelve had achieved it. Korvain had, decades ago, in his prime. Amalura could sense it but not manifest it. The art was dying.

Itzil stared at her palms.

Something flickered. Faint. Warm. A light like a candle flame seen through frosted glass — golden, trembling, barely there. It danced across her palm for half a heartbeat, then vanished.

She clenched her fists. Opened them. Nothing.

She tried again. Closed her eyes. Thought about the sorcerer pressing his hand against the villager's chest. The blank eyes. The puppet-string obedience. The boy who had tried to protect his sister and died for it.

The light came back. Stronger this time — a glow that spread across both palms, pulsing with her heartbeat, warm as sunlight on skin. It lasted two seconds. Three. Then it guttered and died, leaving her hands tingling and her heart hammering.

She lay in the dark, breathing hard. Her palms still felt warm. Something had happened. Something she didn't understand and couldn't control and wasn't sure she wanted.

But it had happened.

She closed her eyes and slept. Tomorrow was Ashmark. Tomorrow was Kaelen. Tomorrow was the beginning of whatever came next.

Her dreams were full of golden light and burning villages and the sound of bells.
