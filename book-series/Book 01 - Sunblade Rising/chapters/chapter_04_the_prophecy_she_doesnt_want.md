# Chapter 4 — THE PROPHECY SHE DOESN'T WANT

_POV: Itzil_

---

The Hall of Embers lay at the deepest level of the Sun-Blade temple — a place Itzil had visited only twice in her life. Both times had been during the annual Solstice ceremony, when the disciples filed through in silence to pay respects to the temple's founders. She remembered the feeling of descending into the earth, the air growing cooler and drier, the walls pressing closer until the corridor opened into a vaulted chamber carved from the living rock of Mount Solara.

Amalura had summoned her here the night before her departure.

The chamber was circular, thirty paces across, with a domed ceiling covered in carvings so old that their edges had softened to suggestions. The walls were covered floor to ceiling in inscriptions — the old sun-language, angular and precise, cut into the stone with a tool that no longer existed. Torches burned in iron brackets, throwing amber light across the carvings and filling the air with the scent of burning pine resin.

Amalura stood at the chamber's center, her hand resting on a waist-high pillar of polished obsidian. She didn't look up when Itzil entered.

"Come here," she said. "And read."

Itzil approached. The pillar was covered in inscriptions — denser than the walls, more precise, the characters smaller and cut deeper. She leaned close and tried to parse the old sun-language. She'd studied it with Amalura for years, but reading it fluently was like reading poetry in a second language — she could get the sense but not the music.

"When the keys are threatened," Amalura translated, her finger tracing the lines, "a bearer will arise. Not chosen by council. Not appointed by elders. Chosen by the light itself. The bearer will carry a blade of pure sunlight — manifested not from metal but from will. The blade will be the answer to the darkness beyond the Gate."

She paused. Her finger moved to the next section. Her voice changed — quieter, harder.

"The bearer will either save the world or fail. There is no middle ground. The blade does not compromise."

Silence in the chamber. The torches hissed.

Itzil straightened. "You think this is about me."

"I think the light that flickered in your hands last night was not an accident." Amalura's one good eye fixed on her. "You didn't tell me about it. You didn't need to. I felt it from my study. A pulse of sun-energy — untrained, undirected, but unmistakable."

"That could have been—"

"It was not a malfunction. It was not a coincidence. The Ember Core was stolen, and within hours, light manifested in your hands. The prophecy describes exactly this: when the relics are threatened, the blade-bearer appears."

Itzil backed away from the pillar. Not consciously — her body moved before her mind caught up, putting distance between herself and the words carved in stone.

"I didn't ask for this."

"The prophecy doesn't ask for volunteers."

"Then pick someone else. Someone better."

Amalura's expression shifted — from the sharp, analytical mask she usually wore to something softer. Something almost like tenderness, though she'd deny it if accused.

"I cannot pick. The light picks. And it picked you." She paused. "I understand your fear, Itzil. I do. This is an enormous weight to carry. But consider: you've been carrying weight your entire life. The orphanage. The temple. The training. Korvain's expectations. The other disciples' resentment. You've carried all of it, and you're still standing. That is not common. That is not accidental."

"Standing is not the same as being ready."

"No. But it's a start."

Itzil looked at the carvings on the walls. Generations of sun-language, centuries of accumulated wisdom, recorded by people who had lived and died and believed in something they couldn't fully see.

"What happened to the last blade-bearer?" she asked.

Amalura hesitated. It was a small thing — a fractional pause, the kind most people wouldn't notice. Itzil noticed.

"Her name was Solara. She was a warrior of this temple, three hundred years ago. She manifested the Sun-Blade during the last major conflict with the forces beyond the Gate."

"And?"

"She fought brilliantly. She was brave and skilled and dedicated. She held the line while the Gate was sealed."

"And then?"

Another pause. "She died. The sealing required more energy than one person could survive channeling. She gave her life to close the Gate."

Itzil said nothing for a long time. The torches crackled. Somewhere above them, the temple slept.

"So the prophecy says I'll save the world or fail," she said finally. "And the last person who succeeded at saving the world died doing it."

"Yes."

"That's not very encouraging, Amalura."

"I have never been in the business of encouragement. I am in the business of truth." She placed both hands on the obsidian pillar. "The prophecy is not a death sentence. It is a possibility. Solara died because the circumstances demanded it. Your circumstances may be different. Your allies may be stronger. Your approach may be wiser."

"Or I may die too."

"Or you may die too. That is true of every person in every war. The prophecy doesn't change the fundamental risk. It only clarifies the stakes."

Itzil found Korvain on the eastern terrace, sitting in the moonlight with a cup of tea that had gone cold.

He didn't turn when she sat beside him. He already knew it was her — he always knew, the way a musician knows a note by its vibration.

"She told you about the prophecy," he said.

"She told me about Solara too."

"Ah." He sipped the cold tea. Made a face. Set it down. "Solara was the best of us. The finest warrior I've ever heard of — and I've studied every warrior in the order's history. She was brilliant, brave, and absolutely relentless."

"And she died."

"She died saving the world. There are worse epitaphs." He was quiet for a moment. The night sounds of the mountain filled the space — wind in pines, insects, the distant murmur of the river below. "She was nineteen. Younger than you are now."

Itzil stared at the valley. Solquetal was dark below — no lamps, no movement. The village that had been her childhood was quiet in the way places become quiet after violence. Not peaceful. Just empty.

"I don't believe in prophecies," she said.

"Neither do I. I believe in patterns. The light manifested in your hands because something in you — some quality, some combination of will and clarity and stubbornness — resonated with the sun-energy at the precise moment it was needed." He turned to face her. "Call it prophecy. Call it coincidence. Call it whatever makes you comfortable. The fact remains: the light chose you. What you do with that is your decision."

"I could ignore it."

"You could. You won't."

She wanted to argue. She couldn't. He was right — the same way Amalura was always right, but gentler. Where Amalura cut with the precision of a surgeon, Korvain placed his truths like stones in a riverbed: solidly, quietly, in places where the current would carry you over them whether you wanted to go or not.

"Tell me about Solara," she said. "Not the warrior. The person."

Korvain leaned back. The moonlight caught his features — the deep lines, the white hair, the eyes that had seen more than most people could imagine and still managed to find something worth looking at.

"She laughed loudly. She was terrible at cooking. She argued with her instructors about everything — philosophy, technique, the best way to sharpen a blade. She had a pet bird — a little sparrow that she'd rescued from a hawk. It sat on her shoulder during training until it got too fat to fly."

Itzil almost smiled. Almost.

"She was the best of us," he said again. "And she still wasn't enough on her own. She had allies. Friends. People who fought beside her, who covered her weaknesses, who carried her when she fell." He met her eyes. "That's what you're going to build, Itzil. Not a solo quest. A team. The blade-bearer doesn't win alone. She wins because she has people worth fighting for."

The mountain wind shifted. Cold air rolled down from the peak, carrying the scent of snow.

"Korvain."

"Yes?"

"I'm scared."

He nodded. Not surprised. Not dismissive. Just acknowledging the truth of it the way he acknowledged everything — fully, without judgment.

"Good. Fear means you understand the stakes. The people who aren't scared are the ones who get everyone killed." He placed his hand on her shoulder. His grip was warm and steady despite the tremors. "You're ready, Itzil. You have been for a while. You just need to stop asking permission to lead."

She looked at her hands. Open palms in the moonlight. She thought about the golden flicker. The warmth. The brief, impossible moment when light had lived in her skin.

She closed her fists. Opened them. Nothing.

Closed them again. Thought about the ash-oathed villagers. The empty eyes. The puppet-string obedience. The world as it was — broken, burning, full of people who couldn't save themselves.

She opened her hands.

Golden light. Faint as candlelight, trembling like a newborn flame. It spread across her palms, pulsing with her heartbeat — warm, alive, hers. It lasted five seconds. Seven. Ten. Then it guttered and died, leaving her fingers tingling and her chest aching with something she couldn't name.

Korvain watched. His expression didn't change, but his eyes — his eyes held something she'd never seen in them before. Not surprise. Not pride. Recognition. As though he'd been waiting for this moment for a very long time.

"Now we have something to work with," he said quietly.

She stared at her hands. The light was gone, but the warmth remained, nested deep in her palms like a coal banked for the night.

Tomorrow she would leave the temple. Tomorrow she would find Kaelen, and whoever came after Kaelen, and whoever came after them. Tomorrow she would begin the work of building something she couldn't yet see the shape of.

Tonight, she sat with her mentor in the moonlight and tried not to think about a warrior named Solara who had been brilliant and brave and dead at nineteen.

She was twenty-two. That was three extra years. She intended to use them.
