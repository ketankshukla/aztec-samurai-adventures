Chapter 5 - FIRST LIGHT

Korvain began her real training before dawn on the day she was supposed to leave.

She'd been packed and ready, her bedroll strapped tight, her blade oiled and sharp, the obsidian token heavy in her breast pocket. She was standing at the temple gate when his voice came from the courtyard behind her.

"Put your things down. You're not leaving yet."

"You said dawn-"

"I said dawn yesterday. Today I'm saying noon. You have four hours. We're using them."

She set her pack against the gate post and followed him to the training courtyard. The morning was still dark - the sky a deep blue-black with the first suggestion of grey at the eastern horizon. The flagstones were cold under her boots. The air smelled of dew and stone and the faint chemical trace of the vault's broken wards, which still hadn't fully dissipated.

Korvain didn't pick up a training blade. He didn't take a fighting stance. He stood in the center of the courtyard with his staff across his shoulders and said, "Show me."

"Show you what?"

"The light. Show me what happened last night."

She held out her hands. Concentrated. Thought about the ash-oaths, the burning village, the empty pedestal. The feelings that had summoned the golden glow the night before.

Nothing.

She tried harder. Squeezed her eyes shut. Clenched her jaw. Willed the light to appear with every ounce of determination she possessed.

Nothing.

"Stop," Korvain said. "You're trying to force it."

"You told me to show you-"

"I told you to show me. I didn't tell you to break your teeth trying." He lowered his staff and approached. "The Sun-Blade is not a physical weapon, Itzil. It's not metal. It's not crafted. It is a projection of the wielder's will, shaped by clarity of purpose and channeled through sunlight. It requires three things." He held up three gnarled fingers. "Intention. Clarity. Surrender."

"Surrender?"

"You cannot force light. You can only let it through. The blade doesn't manifest because you're strong. It manifests because you're clear. Clear about what you want. Clear about why. Clear about who you're fighting for."

"I'm clear-"

"No, you're not. You're standing in a courtyard thinking about technique. Technique is for swords. The Sun-Blade is something else." He stepped back. "Close your eyes."

She closed them.

"Now stop thinking about the blade. Stop thinking about the prophecy, the relics, the war, Amalura's lectures, my expectations - all of it. Let it go."

She tried. The thoughts didn't want to leave. They circled like birds around a roost - the dead villagers, the ash-oaths, the empty pedestal, the letter she should have written to Korvain that she didn't know how to start.

"Breathe," he said. "In through the nose. Out through the mouth. Slower."

She breathed. Slower. The thoughts settled. Not gone - just quieter. Like a river calming after a flood.

"Now think about one thing. One person. One moment. The single, specific reason you would stand between someone else and harm."

The boy. The fourteen-year-old in Solquetal, the one who'd tried to protect his sister. She hadn't been fast enough to save him. She'd arrived seconds after the Dominion soldier's blade had done its work, and she'd found the boy on the cobblestones with his hand reaching toward the alley where his sister had run.

He'd died reaching for someone he loved. He'd died trying to protect her. And he'd been a child, with a child's courage and a child's fragile bones, and the world had broken him for having the audacity to care.

She didn't want the blade because of prophecy. She didn't want it because Korvain said she should or Amalura's scrolls said she must. She wanted it because of that boy. Because somewhere right now, in villages and cities she'd never seen, there were other boys and girls reaching for people they loved and finding only empty air and sharp steel.

The light came.

Not tentative this time. Not a flicker or a suggestion. It came like dawn - a warmth that started in her chest and flowed down her arms and into her hands, pooling in her palms like liquid gold. It was warm but not hot, bright but not blinding, and it hummed with a frequency she could feel in her teeth and her spine and the space behind her eyes.

She opened her hands and the light took shape - elongating, flattening, defining edges. A blade. Crude, rough, crackling with unstable energy, but a BLADE. Three feet of golden light extending from her right hand, casting sharp shadows across the courtyard flagstones.

She held it. Five seconds. Ten. Fifteen. It guttered, surged, guttered again. The energy was wild - she could feel it pulling against her control like a horse that hadn't been broken, eager and powerful and barely contained.

At twenty seconds, the blade flared. A burst of light and heat that scorched the nearest training post - a six-inch circle of blackened wood, smoking in the morning air. The blade dissolved. The light went out. Itzil's hand dropped to her side, tingling and warm.

Korvain stood exactly where he'd been. His expression hadn't changed. But his eyes - always his eyes, the part of him that held everything he wouldn't say aloud - were bright.

"Now we have something to work with," he said.

They trained for three hours. It was unlike any training she'd done before.

Korvain didn't teach her forms or footwork or the thirty-seven guard positions she'd memorized over the past decade. He taught her to feel. To find the clarity that summoned the light and hold it while the world tried to pull her away.

"The blade manifests when you're clear. It dies when you're clouded." He circled her while she held her hands out, trying to sustain the golden glow. "Fear clouds. Anger clouds. Doubt, pride, resentment - all of it clouds. The blade doesn't judge your emotions. It responds to your clarity. You can be afraid AND clear. You can be angry AND clear. You just can't be confused."

The light came and went. Came and went. She could hold it for seconds at a time - thirty, forty, occasionally a full minute before her focus slipped and the glow dissolved.

"Rage makes fire," he said, when she lost control and the energy flared wild again, leaving another scorch mark on the courtyard stones. "Purpose makes a blade. You need to decide which one you want."

By the third hour, she could manifest the blade consistently - a rough, unstable weapon of golden light that lasted thirty to sixty seconds before dissolving. It was crude. It was unreliable. It was the most extraordinary thing she'd ever experienced.

"It responds to you," Korvain said, watching the blade flicker in her hand. "Your mood, your focus, your intention. When you're clear, it's sharp. When you're scattered, it's wild. When you're afraid, it dims. When you're determined, it blazes."

"How do I make it stable?"

"Practice. Time. Experience." He met her eyes. "And something I can't teach you: a defining purpose. The blade stabilizes when the wielder knows - truly, deeply, without reservation - what they're fighting for. Solara's blade was perfect from the day she manifested it. She never doubted her purpose for a single moment."

"What was her purpose?"

"She wanted to protect everyone. Not abstractly - specifically. Every person she met, every child she saw, every stranger who crossed her path. She carried them all." He paused. "It burned her out. No one can carry everyone. You'll need to find your own purpose. Something sustainable. Something that doesn't consume you."

Itzil looked at the blade in her hand - golden, trembling, alive. She thought about the boy in Solquetal. She thought about the ash-oathed villagers standing blank-eyed in the town square. She thought about the people she hadn't met yet - Kaelen the scout, Neyla the healer - and the people beyond them, the thousands and millions who would suffer if the Great Gate opened.

She couldn't carry everyone. Korvain was right about that. But she could carry the ones in front of her. The ones she could see. The ones she could reach.

The blade steadied. Not perfect - still rough at the edges, still flickering - but steadier than before. The golden light hummed at a lower frequency, less frantic, more purposeful.

Korvain nodded. It was the highest praise he gave.

She left at noon, as revised.

The Sun-Blade dissolved when she released her focus, and she sheathed her steel sword at her hip for the road ahead. The golden weapon was powerful but unreliable - she couldn't hold it long enough for sustained combat. Not yet. The steel was her partner until the light was ready to be her weapon.

Korvain stood at the gate again. This time Amalura was with him, and the three junior warriors - Venn, Tuli, and Sorren - were packed and ready.

"First stop: Ashmark," Korvain reminded her. "Find Kaelen. Then move south. There's a border forge where an engineer named Torvane works - he builds weapons and machines. He's been sending proposals to the military academies for years. No one funds him."

"A scout and an engineer."

"And after them, the healer. Neyla. She's somewhere in the eastern refugee camps. You'll have to search." He gripped his staff. "Build something, Itzil. Not just a team - a purpose. Give them a reason to fight that's bigger than revenge or fear."

She shouldered her pack. Touched the obsidian token in her pocket. Looked up at the temple one last time - white stone and golden tile against the blue sky, ancient and enduring and suddenly very small against the enormity of what waited beyond the mountain.

"I'll come back," she said.

"I know you will."

She turned. Walked. Did not look back again.

The road wound east through valleys and forests, past farms and streams and the ordinary geography of a world that didn't know yet how close it was to breaking. She walked with her three companions in a silence that was part determination and part dread and part the buzzing residual energy of golden light still humming in her bones.

That night, at camp, she practiced.

The blade came faster now. She could manifest it in three seconds - a flash of will, a pulse of clarity, and the golden light extended from her palm like thought made solid. She held it in the darkness and watched the light cast shadows through the trees.

It was getting stronger. So was she. But so, somewhere out there, was whatever had taken the Ember Core and oathed the villagers and burned the market and killed the boy.

She extinguished the blade. Lay down. Stared at the stars through the canopy.

Tomorrow was Ashmark. Tomorrow was the scout.

She thought about Korvain's words: He's arrogant, insubordinate, and the best tracker I've ever seen. You'll hate him.

She thought about Amalura's words: The prophecy doesn't ask for volunteers.

She thought about her own words: I'm scared.

Then she slept. And if the golden light flickered in her palms as she dreamed, warm and steady as a heartbeat, neither she nor the night sky noticed.
