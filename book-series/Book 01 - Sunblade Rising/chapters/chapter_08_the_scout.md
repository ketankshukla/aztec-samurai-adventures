# Chapter 8 — THE SCOUT

_POV: Kaelen_

---

The girl from the temple was not what he'd expected.

Kaelen had received visitors before — military officials, mostly, who arrived with pressed uniforms and clean boots and the particular brand of condescension reserved for people stationed too far from the capital to matter. They'd listen to his intelligence reports with polite attention, promise to pass them up the chain of command, and leave. Nothing would change. The reports would vanish into the bureaucratic void, and the Dominion would continue to move its pieces across the board while the people supposed to stop them studied the pieces and discussed the board.

Itzil was different. She had dust on her boots and determination in her eyes, and when she'd told him about the Ember Core and the Great Gate and the prophecy, she hadn't wrapped it in comfortable qualifications or strategic abstractions. She'd told him the truth, plainly and directly, and then she'd offered him the most honest recruitment pitch he'd ever heard: I don't know why you should follow me. But I'm going to fight either way.

That was either very brave or very stupid. Possibly both. He found himself respecting it regardless.

He watched her now from the grain store rooftop as she organized the group for departure. She moved with the confident economy of someone who'd been trained well — every gesture purposeful, no wasted motion. Her three junior warriors followed her instructions without hesitation, which told him they trusted her more than she probably realized. Trust wasn't given freely by soldiers. It was earned in the accumulation of small moments — decisions made under pressure, burdens shared without complaint, the willingness to put yourself between your people and whatever was trying to kill them.

She'd done those things. He could see it in the way they looked at her.

What he couldn't see was whether she understood what she was walking into. The contested zone wasn't the protected interior, where the worst threat was a bandit or a bad storm. Out here, the Dominion was real. Their soldiers were disciplined, their sorcerers were lethal, and their intelligence network was terrifyingly good. He'd learned that lesson three months ago, in a way he would carry for the rest of his life.

He didn't talk about the unit. Not to Hask, not to the other soldiers at Ashmark, not to the ghosts that sat at the edge of his vision when the nights were long and the silence was too loud. Eleven scouts. The best reconnaissance unit in the border forces, each of them hand-picked, each of them trained to operate independently in hostile territory. They'd been his family in the way that soldiers who share danger become family — bound not by blood but by the mutual understanding that each of you would die for the others without hesitation.

They had died. All of them. A Dominion ambush in the Thornwall Pass — perfectly timed, perfectly executed, deploying blood-magic that confused their trail-signs and turned their own tracking techniques against them. The enemy had known their positions, their movement patterns, their communication signals. Someone had studied them the way Kaelen studied Dominion patrols: thoroughly, patiently, and with lethal intent.

He'd survived because he was on a solo patrol fifteen miles east. He'd returned to find the pass empty and the bodies arranged in a line — not out of cruelty, but out of the clinical orderliness that the Dominion applied to everything. Eleven bodies. Eleven packs. Eleven weapons, cleaned and placed beside their owners. A message: we could have scattered you. We chose to show respect. Be grateful.

He hadn't been grateful. He'd been something beyond anger — a cold, specific fury that didn't burn but compressed, diamond-hard and patient, waiting in his chest for a target worth striking.

For three months, he'd channeled that fury into reports. Detailed, precise, comprehensive intelligence on every Dominion movement within two hundred miles of Ashmark. Patrol schedules. Supply routes. Communication patterns. Sorcerer deployments. He'd written it all down and sent it to every authority he could reach, and every authority had responded with silence.

Until Itzil.

She didn't respond with silence. She responded with: I need what you know.

That was enough. For now.

---

They departed Ashmark at dawn, as agreed. Itzil's group of four plus Kaelen made five — a small team, mobile and quiet, which suited his preferences. Large groups were slow, loud, and visible from a distance. Small groups could move through the gaps.

He took point immediately, without asking. Scouting was his function. He didn't need permission to perform it. Itzil watched him move ahead with an expression he couldn't quite read — somewhere between approval and the mild irritation of someone who preferred to be asked before decisions were made.

He didn't ask. Asking was for people who weren't sure of their value. He was very sure of his.

The route south led through contested territory — not actively controlled by either side, but patrolled by Dominion scout teams with increasing frequency. Kaelen read the land the way a scholar reads a book: footprints told stories, broken branches wrote sentences, the behavior of birds at the treeline composed entire chapters about who had passed and when.

"Dominion patrol," he said, two hours into the march. He held up a fist — the universal signal for stop — and crouched at the base of an oak tree. The others froze behind him.

"Where?" Itzil, low and immediate.

He pointed. "Three hundred yards, moving east to west across our line of march. Eight soldiers, light armor, one sorcerer. They'll cross our path in about four minutes."

"How do you know there's a sorcerer?"

"The birds. They're avoiding a spot about fifty yards behind the main group. Animals can sense dark magic — it registers as wrong, the way a dog senses a storm. If the birds are flying around something they can't see, it's usually a sorcerer with an active ward."

Itzil absorbed this without argument. He appreciated that. Some commanders challenged every assessment out of habit. She challenged what needed challenging and accepted what didn't.

"Options?" she asked.

"We wait. Let them pass. Four minutes of patience costs us nothing. Engaging an eight-person patrol with a sorcerer gains us nothing."

"Agreed."

They waited. The patrol crossed — exactly as he'd predicted, eight soldiers in Dominion black and silver, with a robed figure trailing behind them radiating the subtle wrongness that marked active sorcery. They passed within two hundred yards, oblivious to the five people pressed against the tree line.

When the patrol was gone, Kaelen led them south through a ravine that would have been invisible from any approach except the one he'd memorized during his months of solitary scouting. He knew this land. Every fold, every stream, every ridgeline. He knew it because knowing it was the difference between survival and the alternative.

"You're good at this," Venn said from behind him. The young warrior seemed incapable of extended silence.

"I know."

"Most people would say something modest."

"Most people aren't as good at this as I am."

By afternoon, they'd cleared the patrol zone and were moving through open country toward the southern border. Kaelen called a rest at a stream crossing — clear water, good sight lines, defensible position against casual approach.

He sat apart from the group, as was his habit. He ate dried meat and flatbread from his pack and studied the terrain ahead through his spyglass. The landscape was changing — grassland giving way to hills, with the first suggestion of the mountainous terrain that separated the border from the deeper interior.

Itzil approached. She moved well for a temple warrior — quieter than he'd expected, with an awareness of her surroundings that suggested training beyond basic swordsmanship.

"Can I sit?" she asked.

"It's a free country. For now."

She sat on a rock beside him. Pulled out her own rations. They ate in silence for a minute — the comfortable silence of people who were still measuring each other and hadn't decided where the edges were.

"Your reports," she said. "The intelligence you've been sending. I read some of it on the way here. Korvain forwarded what he could."

"And?"

"It's the most detailed tactical analysis of Dominion operations I've ever seen. If anyone had acted on it three months ago, the border situation would be completely different."

Something shifted in his chest. A tightness he'd been carrying so long he'd stopped noticing it — the tightness of shouting into a void and hearing nothing come back. Someone had read his reports. Someone had understood them. Someone had used the word *acted* as though action was not only possible but expected.

He didn't show it. He'd spent three months not showing things, and the skill had become a habit.

"Why didn't they?" he asked.

"Politics. Bureaucracy. The inability of comfortable people to believe that uncomfortable things are happening to other people far away." She met his eyes. Direct. No evasion. "The same reason they didn't respond to your requests for reinforcement. The same reason Ashmark is falling apart. The center doesn't see the edges until the edges are on fire."

"And now?"

"Now the edges are on fire."

He looked at her. Really looked, the way he looked at terrain — reading the contours, the sight lines, the hidden features that revealed themselves only to sustained attention.

She was scared. He could see it in the tension around her jaw, the way her fingers gripped her water skin slightly too hard, the micro-adjustments in her posture that spoke of someone bracing for an impact they couldn't see coming. She was scared, and she was here anyway, and she was telling him the truth about a situation that most people would soften or evade.

"Korvain said I'd hate you," she said.

"Do you?"

"Not yet. Give it time."

The ghost of something appeared at the corner of his mouth. Not a smile. He'd forgotten how to smile three months ago, in a pass full of bodies. But something adjacent. Something that remembered what smiling felt like and wasn't entirely opposed to the memory.

"Where are we going next?" he asked.

"South. There's an engineer at a border forge. Then east to find a healer in the refugee camps."

"Building a team."

"Building something. I don't know what shape it is yet."

He nodded. Stood. Packed his spyglass. Checked his bow, his arrows, his knives — the inventory of a man who'd learned that readiness was the only prayer worth saying.

"I'll scout the route ahead. There's a Dominion checkpoint on the southern road that we'll need to avoid. I know a way around it."

He started to walk. Stopped. Turned back.

"The reports," he said. "You're the first person who read them and came here."

She looked at him. The fear was there. And beside it, steady and quiet: conviction.

"That's because I'm the first person who understood that reports don't mean anything unless someone does something about them."

He held her gaze for a beat longer than was comfortable. Then he turned and walked into the tree line, and the forest swallowed him the way it always did — completely, silently, as though he'd never been there at all.

Behind him, the group packed up and prepared to move. Itzil watched the spot where Kaelen had vanished. She didn't say anything. She didn't need to.

The scout was in. Arrogant, insubordinate, and brilliant — exactly as advertised.

Now she needed an engineer.
