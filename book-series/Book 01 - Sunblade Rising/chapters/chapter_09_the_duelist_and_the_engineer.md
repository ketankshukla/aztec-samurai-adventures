# Chapter 9 — THE DUELIST AND THE ENGINEER

_POV: Itzil_

---

They found Jagren in a fighting pit.

The warrior clan encampment sprawled across a river valley two days south of Ashmark — a semi-permanent settlement of tents and wooden structures that served as a gathering point for mercenaries, freelance warriors, and anyone with a blade and an appetite for employment. The clan wasn't a single family but a loose confederation of fighters who shared a code: fight fairly, honor debts, and never stab anyone in the back unless they'd stabbed you first.

The fighting pit occupied the camp's center — a circular depression thirty feet across, lined with packed earth and ringed by tiered seating made from logs and planks. When Itzil's group arrived in the late afternoon, the seats were packed. Two hundred people, maybe more, cheering, betting, and drinking with the particular enthusiasm of an audience that had nothing else to do and nowhere else to be.

In the pit, a young man was destroying his opponent.

He was Itzil's age, give or take — dark-haired, lean, and moving with a speed that made the air around him seem slow by comparison. His blade was a slim, curved weapon designed for speed rather than power, and he used it the way a musician uses an instrument: with technical precision so complete it transcended into art.

His opponent was bigger, stronger, and increasingly desperate. The larger man swung heavy, chopping blows that would have been devastating if they'd landed. None of them landed. The young man wasn't just faster — he occupied a different category of fast, the kind that made other fast people look like they were wading through honey.

The finishing move came so quickly that most of the audience missed it. A feint to the left, a pivot that defied the normal rules of momentum, and a strike from an angle that shouldn't have been physically possible. The larger man's sword went spinning. The young man's blade stopped a quarter inch from his opponent's throat.

Silence. Then the roar.

The young man turned to the audience and spread his arms. He grinned — a wide, genuine, entirely un-humble grin that said he knew exactly how good he was and felt no particular need to pretend otherwise.

"That," Kaelen said from beside Itzil, his voice flat as a blade, "is exactly the kind of person who gets other people killed."

His name was Jagren, and he was delighted to meet them.

Not delighted in the measured, diplomatic way of someone managing a social interaction. Delighted in the way a child is delighted by a new toy — immediately, completely, and with a volume that suggested his enthusiasm had never been introduced to the concept of discretion.

"A Sun-Blade warrior? An actual Sun-Blade warrior?" He pumped Itzil's hand with both of his, still sweating from the pit fight. "I've read about your order. The golden blades, the ancient temple, the warrior tradition stretching back centuries. Incredible. Absolutely incredible. And you're building a team? To fight the Dominion?"

"That's the plan," Itzil said, extracting her hand.

"I'm in."

Kaelen and Itzil exchanged a glance. She could read his thought as clearly as if he'd spoken it: too eager. People who rushed into fights without asking questions were the first ones to rush out of them — or the first ones to not come out at all.

"You don't know what we're facing," Itzil said.

"You're facing the Dominion. I know what they are. I've seen their soldiers come through here — recruiting, requisitioning, doing the things empires do to the edges of their territory. They think they own the world. Someone needs to teach them they don't."

"That's not a reason. That's a slogan."

Jagren's grin dimmed, fractionally. Not extinguished — nothing short of catastrophe could extinguish a grin like that — but tempered. He looked at her with something sharper behind the flash.

"You want a reason? Fine. I fight because it's what I do. I've been fighting since I could hold a blade. I'm the best duelist in this camp — probably the best on this side of the continent. And I am absolutely, completely, one hundred percent wasting my time in a fighting pit."

He gestured at the arena. "This is entertainment. It's not real. Nobody's life depends on me being good. Nobody's freedom hangs on whether I win or lose. I'm fighting for applause, and applause is empty." He met her eyes. "I want to fight for something that matters. If you're offering that, I'm in."

The sincerity was real. Under the flash and the volume and the grin, Jagren meant every word. He wanted to matter. That hunger — for significance, for purpose — was as genuine as anything she'd encountered.

It was also dangerous. People who fought for significance took risks they shouldn't take. They sought glory in moments that demanded caution. They made beautiful choices that got ugly results.

But he was fast. Impossibly, undeniably fast. And in the war that was coming, fast might keep people alive.

"We leave at dawn," she said. "Pack light."

His grin returned at full power. "Already packed."

The border forge was half a day's march south, set into a hillside above a stream that provided both water for cooling and power for the bellows. It was a functional place — no aesthetics, no decoration, just stone walls, a massive chimney, and the constant rhythmic sound of metal being shaped by someone who understood it at a fundamental level.

They found Torvane inside.

He was the opposite of Jagren in every measurable way. Where Jagren was loud, Torvane was silent. Where Jagren moved with theatrical flair, Torvane moved with mechanical precision. Where Jagren talked constantly, Torvane communicated primarily through raised eyebrows and the occasional grunt.

He was compact — medium height, stocky, with forearms corded with muscle from years of forge work. His hands were large, scarred, and spectacularly dexterous. He wore a leather apron over practical clothing, and his workspace was a precisely organized landscape of tools, metals, and half-finished projects that ranged from conventional weapons to devices that Itzil couldn't begin to identify.

When they entered the forge, he didn't look up. He was assembling something — a cylindrical device with an intricate internal mechanism that involved springs, gears, and what appeared to be a small crystal that pulsed with faint magical energy.

"Torvane?" Itzil said.

"Busy."

"We need to talk."

"Busy now. Talk later." He adjusted something inside the cylinder with a pair of needle-thin pliers. "Later meaning when I've finished calibrating this charge regulator, which requires concentration, which requires silence, which requires you to not be here."

Kaelen leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed. Jagren vibrated with the restless energy of someone who'd been standing still for more than thirty seconds. Venn opened his mouth. Tuli elbowed him.

They waited.

Seven minutes later, Torvane set down his pliers, placed the device in a padded case, and turned to face them. His expression was neutral — not unwelcoming, not hostile, simply the face of a man who allocated his attention like a resource and had just freed up some allocation.

"You're from the Sun-Blade temple," he said, noting the obsidian token. "You want something."

Itzil told him what she'd told Kaelen and Jagren. The Ember Core. The relics. The Great Gate. The Dominion.

Torvane listened with the focused attention of someone processing raw data. When she finished, he was quiet for ten seconds — an eternity by conversation standards, during which Itzil could practically see the calculations running behind his eyes.

"The Dominion's war-beasts," he said. "Their siege weapons. Their alchemical sorcery. All of it is engineering. Built. Manufactured. Dependent on supply chains, maintenance, and the continued availability of raw materials." He looked at the devices on his workbench. "I've been designing countermeasures for three years. Ward-disruptors. Signal jammers. Portable fortifications. Explosive charges optimized for specific Dominion alloy compositions." He picked up a small metal cylinder. "This, for example, generates a pulse that neutralizes the alchemical wards the Dominion uses on their field encampments. Range: forty meters. Duration: twelve seconds. Long enough to breach any standard defensive perimeter."

"You've built all this?"

"I've built prototypes. I've sent proposals to every military academy, every border command, every organization that should care about stopping the most powerful empire on the continent from conquering everything in sight." His voice carried no bitterness — just the clinical frustration of someone whose solutions had been ignored by the people who needed them most. "No one funded me. No one responded."

Kaelen made a small sound. Itzil glanced at him and saw recognition on his face — the same story he'd lived. Reports sent. Solutions offered. Silence returned.

"I'm not a military academy," Itzil said. "I can't fund your work. I can offer you something better: a chance to test your designs against actual Dominion targets."

Torvane looked at his workshop. The prototypes. The blueprints. The years of work that no one had used.

"I build things that work," he said. "If you want things that are pretty, find someone else."

"I want things that keep people alive."

He nodded. Reached for his pack — already partially assembled, Itzil noticed. Like Kaelen's, like Jagren's. These people had been ready. Waiting. All they'd needed was someone to point the way.

"When do we leave?" Torvane asked.

"Dawn."

He nodded again. Began systematically packing his most critical tools and prototypes with the methodical efficiency of a man who had thought about this moment many times.

Jagren watched the process with undisguised fascination. "What's that thing?" he asked, pointing at a device shaped like a nested set of brass rings.

"Ward-disruptor."

"And that?"

"Explosive charge."

"And the—"

"If you touch anything in this forge, I will remove your fingers with the industrial shears and feed them to the stream."

Jagren pulled his hand back. "I like him," he told Itzil.

"Everyone likes me," Torvane said, without looking up. "I don't know why. I'm not likeable."

That night, camped between the forge and the road south, Itzil sat at the fire's edge and counted her team.

Kaelen the scout — sharp, wounded, seeing everything.
Jagren the duelist — fast, eager, needing a purpose beyond applause.
Torvane the engineer — precise, frustrated, carrying solutions no one had asked for.
Venn, Tuli, Sorren — her junior warriors, loyal and learning.

Seven people. Against an empire.

Kaelen sat across the fire, cleaning his blade in the light. His movements were automatic — the kind of maintenance that came from years of practice, hands moving without conscious direction while his mind worked on something else.

"We need the healer," he said, not looking up. "The one Korvain mentioned. Neyla."

"I know."

"The refugee camps are three days east. Dominion-controlled territory for the last fifty miles."

"I know."

"And somewhere along the way, we're going to run into something we can't scout around or fight through. The Dominion knows the temple was hit. They know someone survived. They'll be looking for us."

"I know."

He looked up. Firelight. Sharp features. Dark eyes holding something he didn't name.

"You say 'I know' a lot for someone who doesn't have a plan."

"I have a plan. Keep moving. Find Neyla. Don't die."

"That's not a plan. That's a to-do list."

"It's a start." She met his eyes across the fire. "Plans require intelligence. You're the intelligence. So tomorrow, on the road, you tell me everything you know about Dominion operations in the eastern sector, and I'll turn your intelligence into a plan."

Something changed in his expression. Subtle. The way a landscape changes when a cloud passes and the light shifts — everything the same but differently lit. She'd offered him the thing he'd been denied for three months: someone who would use what he knew.

"Dawn," he said.

"Dawn."

He went back to cleaning his blade. She went back to studying the fire.

Tomorrow was the road east. Tomorrow was Dominion territory. Tomorrow was Neyla — wherever she was, whoever she was, whatever she could do that Amalura said shouldn't be possible.

The team was growing. Four strong, with three more. Seven against an empire.

It wasn't enough. It would have to be.
