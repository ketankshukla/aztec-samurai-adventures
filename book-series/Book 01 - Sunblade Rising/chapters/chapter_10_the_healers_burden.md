# Chapter 10 — THE HEALER'S BURDEN

_POV: Neyla_

---

The child had been coughing for three days.

Neyla knelt beside the makeshift cot — a blanket thrown over a pallet of straw in a tent that leaked when it rained, which was often — and pressed her hands against the girl's chest. The girl was six, maybe seven. Thin in the way that refugee children were thin, with hollow cheeks and eyes that were too large for her face and a cough that rattled in her lungs like stones in a drum.

Neyla closed her eyes and reached.

Her healing magic was not dramatic. There were no golden flashes, no shimmering auras, no visible display of supernatural power. It felt, from the inside, like listening — extending her awareness into the body beneath her hands and hearing what it had to say. The lungs spoke of fluid. The blood spoke of infection. The heart, small and determined, spoke of a body fighting to survive with resources it didn't have.

She pushed warmth into the girl's chest. Not heat — warmth. The kind of warmth that a mother's hand gives when pressed against a feverish forehead: reassuring, intentional, alive. She coaxed the fluid to thin, the infection to slow, the immune response to rally. It was delicate work. Heavy-handed healing caused more damage than it repaired — the body was a system, and systems responded to finesse, not force.

After twenty minutes, the coughing eased. The girl's breathing deepened. Color returned to her lips.

"She'll sleep now," Neyla told the girl's mother — a woman who hadn't slept in three days herself and whose eyes held the specific exhaustion of someone who had been running and was still running, even while standing still. "The infection will break by morning. Keep her warm. Give her water when she wakes."

The mother gripped Neyla's hand. Her fingers were rough, her grip painfully tight. She didn't speak. She didn't need to. The grip said everything: *thank you* and *please don't leave* and *I can't do this alone*.

Neyla squeezed back. Then she gently extracted her hand and moved to the next patient.

The refugee camp occupied a strip of no-man's-land between the eastern border and the Dominion's outer territories — a mile of scrubland and trampled grass that had become, through the accumulated desperation of thousands, a temporary city. Tents stretched in every direction, organized not by plan but by arrival: the earliest refugees near the center, the latest on the edges, and everyone in between arranged by the haphazard logic of people finding empty space and claiming it.

Neyla had been here for four months. She'd arrived with nothing but her medical knowledge, her healing magic, and a fury so deep it had burned through the initial shock and settled into something colder and more permanent: purpose.

Her family was gone. Not dead — worse. Her mother, her father, her younger sister. Ash-oathed. She'd watched it happen, from behind a wall, through a crack in the plaster, while Dominion sorcerers pressed their hands against her family's chests and burned the sigils in. She'd watched her mother's eyes go blank. Her father's hands fall limp. Her sister — twelve years old, bright and loud and impossible to silence — go quiet.

She'd run. Not bravely. Not strategically. She'd run because her body had moved before her mind could process what was happening, and by the time her mind caught up she was two miles away and there was nothing left to go back to.

The guilt of that running lived in her like a second heartbeat. It was always there, always beating, always reminding her: you left them. You left them standing with empty eyes and puppet-string bodies, and you ran.

She'd come to the refugee camp because it was the closest thing to a purpose she could find. People needed healing. She could heal. The equation was simple, even if the execution was exhausting.

She worked eighteen-hour days. She treated infections, wounds, fevers, malnutrition, and the particular brand of psychological damage that came from losing everything and ending up in a tent in a field in the middle of nowhere. She was the only healer in the camp with genuine magical ability. The others were herbalists, bone-setters, and well-meaning volunteers with varying degrees of competence. She was grateful for all of them and insufficient without them.

The camp held approximately three thousand people. Three thousand bodies, three thousand souls, three thousand stories of loss and displacement and the stubborn refusal to stop existing even when every material reason for existence had been stripped away. They ate what the supply convoys brought — when the convoys arrived, which was less and less frequently. They slept in tents that were never warm enough. They cared for each other with the desperate generosity of people who had nothing left to give except attention.

Neyla loved them. All of them. Not abstractly, not as a concept, but specifically and individually, the way a gardener loves each plant in a garden — knowing their needs, their weaknesses, their particular way of leaning toward light.

She was treating a man with a broken arm — compound fracture, the bone visible through torn skin, infection already setting in — when the strangers arrived.

There were seven of them. Five were clearly warriors — armed, armored, travel-worn. The sixth was a short, stocky man with a leather apron and the callused hands of a craftsman. The seventh walked at the front, and Neyla noticed her before she noticed anyone else.

The woman carried herself with the careful balance of someone trained in combat — weight centered, awareness wide, every step a controlled placement rather than a casual motion. She was young — early twenties — with dark hair pulled back and eyes that held equal measures of determination and exhaustion. She wore a steel sword at her hip and something at her collar that caught the light: an obsidian token, carved with a symbol Neyla recognized from the old texts her grandmother had kept.

Sun-Blade order.

The woman approached the medical tent. She stopped at the entrance and waited — not barging in, not demanding attention, just waiting until Neyla had finished setting the broken arm and wrapping it in a splint.

"Neyla?" the woman asked.

"I'm busy."

"I can see that. I can wait."

She waited. For forty-five minutes, while Neyla finished with the broken arm, treated a child's fever, cleaned and dressed a wound on an elderly man's leg, and convinced a young mother to eat something despite having no appetite. The woman watched all of it with the particular attention of someone cataloging capabilities.

When the last patient was settled, Neyla washed her hands in a basin of water that she'd purified with a touch of her magic — heating it just enough to kill bacteria, cooling it instantly afterward. She dried her hands on a cloth and turned to face the stranger.

"I'm Itzil," the woman said. "I'm from the Sun-Blade temple on Mount Solara. I need your help."

"Everyone in this camp needs my help."

"I know. That's why I came to you instead of sending a message." Itzil stepped closer. "What you do here — the healing, the care, the way these people look at you — it's extraordinary. But there's a war coming, Neyla. A war that will make this camp look like a quiet afternoon. And the skills you have are needed not just here but everywhere."

"My skills are needed HERE. These people—"

"Will be ash-oathed if the Dominion reaches this camp. Every person you've healed, every child you've treated, every life you've saved — all of it erased by a sorcerer's hand and a sigil on the chest."

The words hit like a physical blow. Not because they were cruel — because they were true. Neyla had been treating symptoms while the disease marched closer every day.

She looked at the camp around her. The tents. The cook fires. The children playing in the dust between the tent rows, their laughter bright and fragile and completely unaware of what was coming for them.

"What are you offering?" she asked.

"A chance to fight. Not with a sword — with what you can do. Your healing magic. The ash-oaths, Neyla. Amalura — our scholar — believes there may be a way to reverse them. A healer with enough power and precision could theoretically break the magic that holds them."

Neyla's heart stopped. Not literally — she was a healer, she knew what a literal cardiac arrest felt like — but the metaphorical version, the kind where the world pauses and reconfigures around a single piece of information.

"Reverse ash-oaths?" she whispered.

"Theoretically. No one's done it. But if anyone could..."

If anyone could. If anyone could undo the magic that had taken her mother's eyes and her father's hands and her sister's voice. If anyone could give back what had been stolen — not just for her family but for the thousands, the tens of thousands who'd been erased by the Dominion's most terrible weapon.

"I can't guarantee we'll win," Itzil said. Her voice was quiet. Honest. "I can't guarantee anything. But I can guarantee that we'll fight for the people who can't fight for themselves. That's what I'm offering."

Neyla looked at the camp. At the refugees. At the girl she'd healed that morning, now sleeping peacefully in a tent that leaked when it rained.

She looked at Itzil. At the obsidian token. At the determination in those exhausted eyes.

"I need to arrange coverage," she said. "The herbalists can handle routine care, but the serious cases—"

"Take the time you need."

"And I'm bringing my kit." She pointed at a battered leather bag that contained every medical supply she'd accumulated over four months. "All of it."

"Bring whatever you need."

Neyla began packing. Her hands moved with the same efficiency she applied to wound care — systematic, thorough, nothing forgotten. Bandages, herbs, tools, her personal notes on every treatment protocol she'd developed.

As she worked, a young girl appeared at the tent entrance — the same girl she'd healed that morning. She was standing, pale but alert, with a blanket wrapped around her shoulders and a look on her face that was equal parts confusion and concern.

"Where are you going?" the girl asked.

Neyla knelt. Looked into the girl's too-large eyes.

"I need to go help some other people. Far away."

"Will you come back?"

The question hung in the air. Neyla felt the weight of it — the same weight she felt every time someone looked at her with trust she wasn't sure she'd earned.

"I'll try," she said.

She didn't promise. She never promised what she couldn't keep. But she held the girl's hand for a moment, warm and steady, and the girl held back, and for a few heartbeats the entire war and the prophecy and the ash-oaths and the Great Gate shrank to the size of two people holding on.

Then Neyla stood, shouldered her bag, and walked out of the tent into the late afternoon light.

Itzil was waiting. Beside her, a lean man with dark eyes and a short bow who watched the perimeter with the focused attention of someone who never stopped watching. A flashy young man who vibrated with energy. A quiet man in a leather apron who examined a tent pole with professional interest.

Her team. If she chose to join it.

She chose.

"Where to?" she asked.

Itzil looked at the road ahead — east, into Dominion territory, into the unknown. "Forward."

"That's not an answer."

"It's the only one I have right now."

Neyla adjusted her medical bag on her shoulder. She'd spent four months treating the wounded. Now she was joining the people who made the wounds unnecessary.

It was terrifying. It felt like the first honest thing she'd done since running from her family's house four months ago.

She walked forward. She didn't look back. She didn't need to.

The camp would be here when she returned. If she returned. And the girl with the too-large eyes would remember that someone had held her hand and said *I'll try* — which was, in the end, the most honest promise anyone could make.
