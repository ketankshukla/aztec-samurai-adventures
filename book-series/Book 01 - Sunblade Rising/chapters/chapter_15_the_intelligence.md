# Chapter 15 — THE INTELLIGENCE

_POV: Itzil_

---

The stolen scrolls told a story that Itzil wished she could unread.

She spread them across the flat rock that served as their planning surface, weighting the corners with stones against the morning breeze. The team gathered around — five people studying documents written in Dominion cipher that Kaelen translated as he read, his fluency in the enemy's language another product of three months of solitary intelligence work.

"Relic status report," he read, finger tracing the angular script. "Dated twelve days ago. Ember Core: secured, in transit to capital. Heartstone: acquisition pending — the Brightfall temple site has been excavated but the relic was not found in the primary vault. Search teams deployed to secondary locations. Voidglass: secured, integrated into the capital's defensive infrastructure."

"That's three confirmed in their possession," Itzil said. "Two secured, one missing."

"Four remaining unaccounted for. The Dominion has confirmed locations for two of them." Kaelen moved to a map — a Dominion military chart far more detailed than Amalura's hand-drawn version. "Tide Pearl: coastal temple, southern reaches. They've dispatched a thirty-person retrieval team with two sorcerers. Estimated arrival: nine days from the date of this report."

"Which means they're already there," Torvane said. "Or close."

"The Starshard: Shattered Peaks mountain fortress. A larger team — fifty soldiers, four sorcerers, engineering support. The fortress is apparently well-defended by ancient wards that have resisted previous attempts."

"And the last two relics?"

"The Sunheart and the Dawnchain. No confirmed locations. The report notes that historical records are contradictory and that intelligence assets have been assigned to research." He paused. "Specifically, they mention a scholar in their custody who may have relevant knowledge. An elder from a Sun-Blade tradition temple captured during a border raid."

Itzil's blood went cold. "Which temple?"

Kaelen checked the report. "Doesn't say. But the description — elder, scholarly, knowledge of relic lore — sounds like someone from our tradition."

She thought of Amalura. Of the other temples Korvain had mentioned — some fallen, some silent. If the Dominion had captured a Sun-Blade scholar, they had access to knowledge that could accelerate their relic search enormously.

"We send this to Korvain immediately," she said. "All of it. He needs to know about the captured scholar, the relic locations, and the Dominion's timeline."

Venn prepared the hawk. The bird was restless — it didn't like being carried through rivers — but it was trained and reliable. The intelligence was copied onto thin paper, sealed in a waterproof tube, and attached to the hawk's leg. Venn launched it from the overhang's edge, and it caught the morning thermals and turned north.

"Now," Itzil said. "The Tide Pearl."

The tactical problem was straightforward: a Dominion team of thirty soldiers and two sorcerers was ahead of them, heading for the same relic. The heroes' team was eight people — five combatants, three support. Even accounting for surprise, the numbers were catastrophically unfavorable.

"We don't fight thirty soldiers," Kaelen said. "We let them find the relic and take it from the retrieval team after they've done the hard work."

"The plan from the campfire," Jagren said. "My plan."

"Our plan," Kaelen corrected, without looking at him.

The approach required speed. The coastal temple was two weeks' march at normal pace — too slow. They needed to arrive before the Dominion team extracted the relic and departed.

"Torvane," Itzil said. "Can you build anything that moves faster than walking?"

He considered. "Not in the field. But I know someone who might have what we need." He pulled out a small notebook — his personal index of contacts, suppliers, and people who owed him favors. "There's a smuggler network that operates along the southern trade route. They use lightweight carts pulled by mountain horses — fast, maneuverable, designed for moving cargo through Dominion checkpoints without detection."

"Can you reach them?"

"I can reach their drop point. Two days east. If they have availability, they can move us to the coast in six days instead of fourteen."

The cost was risk — using a smuggler network meant trusting people whose primary motivation was profit. But the alternative was arriving too late, and too late meant the Dominion had four relics and was halfway to opening the Great Gate.

"Do it," Itzil said.

Korvain's response arrived by hawk two days later, as they were approaching the smuggler's drop point.

The message was brief — Korvain's style was economy, not elaboration. But the content made Itzil read it three times.

_Intelligence received. Confirmed against our own sources. The captured scholar is from the fallen temple at Brightfall — an elder named Varshan, specializing in relic geography. He has knowledge of at least three relic locations that we do not. If the Dominion extracts this knowledge, they will know where every remaining relic is hidden._

_Regarding Nightshade: she is more dangerous than you know. She doesn't fight. She talks. And people who listen to her don't come back. Her blood-magic allows her to read emotional states through biological resonance and to craft arguments that target the listener's specific vulnerabilities. She will find your fears and use them against you._

_Be careful, Itzil. And be fast. The Tide Pearl is critical — if we can deny the Dominion even one relic, we slow their timeline by months._

_One more thing. The light I felt the night before you left — practice it. Every day. You will need it sooner than you think._

She read the last line twice more. Then she folded the message and tucked it into her breast pocket, beside the obsidian token.

Korvain knew about Nightshade. Korvain was worried. Korvain — who had faced down everything the world had thrown at him for seventy-three years with iron calm — was telling her to be careful.

She touched the pocket. Felt the token's weight. Felt the message's weight.

Then she squared her shoulders and walked to where the team was waiting.

"We have confirmation," she said. "The Tide Pearl is critical. Korvain wants us to move fast." She didn't share the warning about Nightshade — not yet. That information would come when it was tactically relevant, not as a source of pre-emptive anxiety.

"The smuggler contact?" she asked Torvane.

"Confirmed. They have a cart and horses available. Cost is high, but they'll take us to the coast in six days."

"Then we pay it."

They moved east, toward the drop point, toward the coast, toward a relic that might keep the world from ending.

Behind them, the hawk circled once and disappeared north. In front of them, the road stretched south through contested territory, past Dominion patrols and surveillance and the invisible web of Nightshade's intelligence network.

Somewhere ahead, a team of thirty Dominion soldiers marched toward the same destination. Somewhere behind, tracking teams searched for the scent that had vanished at a river crossing. And somewhere above it all, in a throne room of black marble and silver, a man with tarnished-silver eyes studied reports about a girl with golden light and decided what to do about her.

The race was on. And they were behind.
