# Chapter 16 — THE BORDER CROSSING

_POV: Jagren_

---

Jagren had never been this far from the fighting pits.

The thought arrived uninvited as he sat in the back of the smuggler's cart, wedged between a crate of dried fish and Torvane's equipment pack, watching the landscape change from hills to coastal scrubland. The air had shifted — heavier, saltier, carrying the promise of ocean that he'd never seen except in stories told by travelers passing through the warrior camps.

He was a long way from home. He wasn't sure he had a home.

The pits had been his world since he was fourteen. Before that: a series of foster homes in a series of forgettable towns, each one ending when his temper or his fists found trouble he couldn't talk his way out of. The warrior camps had taken him in because they took everyone in — that was the code. If you could hold a blade, you belonged. And Jagren could more than hold a blade. He could make a blade sing.

Fighting was the first thing he'd ever been good at. The first thing that made people look at him with something other than annoyance or pity. In the ring, with a weapon in his hand and an opponent in front of him, he was someone. The crowd saw him. The crowd cheered. The crowd remembered his name.

Out here, there was no crowd. There were seven people in two carts, rattling along a smuggler's road through Dominion-adjacent territory, heading toward a coastal temple where a glowing rock was supposedly hidden. No one was watching. No one was cheering. And the fights ahead wouldn't end with a bowed opponent and a roar of applause. They'd end with blood and screaming and people who didn't get up.

He'd killed the Dominion soldier at Thornspire — one of the gate guards, during the distraction phase that hadn't been needed because Kaelen's infiltration had gone perfectly. The guard had spotted Jagren's position and come to investigate, and Jagren had put his blade through the man's throat before the investigation could become an alarm.

It had taken two seconds. The man had dropped like a puppet with cut strings. No drama. No duel. No moment of eye contact across a ring where both combatants knew the rules and the stakes and the boundaries.

Just a man alive, then not.

Jagren had thrown up afterward. Quietly, behind a tree, where no one could see. He'd cleaned his blade and returned to position and said nothing about it.

The smuggler's road bypassed three Dominion checkpoints. The driver — a leathery woman named Dox who communicated primarily through grunts and the creative use of profanity — knew every hidden path, every gap in the patrol schedule, every friendly farm where a cart could be hidden in a barn while soldiers passed.

They traveled by night and rested by day. The journey compressed — six days of darkness and jolting roads and the smell of dried fish and the constant, low-grade fear that every shadow might contain a Dominion patrol.

During the daytime rest stops, Jagren trained. Not the showy forms he'd perfected in the pits — the spinning strikes, the dramatic flourishes, the crowd-pleasing combinations that looked spectacular and worked perfectly against opponents who played by rules. Instead, he practiced what Kaelen had shown him: simple movements. Direct strikes. Economy of motion.

"You're too pretty," Kaelen had said, watching Jagren practice on the second day. The scout was leaning against a tree with his arms crossed, his expression hovering between critique and amusement.

"Excuse me?"

"Your fighting. It's pretty. Every move is designed to look good. That's fine in a ring. In a real fight, pretty gets you killed."

"I won at Thornspire—"

"You killed a man who wasn't expecting you. That's not fighting. That's execution." Kaelen straightened. "Real combat is ugly. It's short and brutal and the person who wins is the one who does the least amount of work for the most amount of damage. You add three unnecessary movements to every attack because they look good."

Jagren wanted to be angry. He searched for anger and found, underneath it, the uncomfortable recognition that Kaelen was right. The flourishes — the spins, the blade-twirls, the dramatic changes of stance — were habitual. They were the language of the pits, where fighting was entertainment and style was currency. Out here, style was weight. And weight slowed you down.

"Show me," he said.

Kaelen drew one of his knives. "Attack me."

Jagren attacked — his standard opening, a feint-to-thrust combination that was fast, deceptive, and had beaten every opponent he'd faced in the pits.

Kaelen didn't block. He didn't parry. He sidestepped — a single step, perfectly timed — and let the thrust pass through the space where he'd been. Then he was inside Jagren's guard, knife at his throat, the entire exchange lasting less than a second.

"See?" Kaelen said. "One step. One movement. Your attack had six movements. I needed one."

"That's not fighting. That's cheating."

"There's no such thing as cheating in combat. There's alive and there's dead. Pick one."

Jagren picked alive. He spent the remaining rest stops stripping his technique down to essentials — removing the flourishes, tightening the transitions, finding the straight line between intent and action. It felt wrong. It felt ugly. It felt like cutting the beauty out of the only thing he was good at.

But when he practiced the simplified forms, he was faster. Not a little faster — significantly faster. Without the decorative movements, his strikes arrived sooner, his recovery was quicker, and his overall effectiveness doubled.

"Better," Kaelen said on the fourth day, watching Jagren drill the stripped-down forms. It was the first compliment the scout had given anyone. Jagren pretended it didn't matter. It did.

On the fifth day, they passed through a destroyed village.

Not burned — emptied. Every building intact, every door closed, every window shuttered. But no people. No animals. No movement. The silence was absolute, the kind of silence that fills a space where sound used to live and leaves an outline of its absence.

Jagren walked through the village with the rest of the team. His hand was on his blade. His senses were screaming.

Ash-oath sigils were scorched into every door. The distinctive crimson marks — circular, nested, pulsing with a faint residual glow — covered the village like a rash. The Dominion hadn't destroyed this place. They'd harvested it. Every person, every soul, processed and taken.

He found a child's toy in the rubble near the village square. A wooden horse, half-buried in dust, its paint faded and one leg broken. Someone had made it by hand — he could see the tool marks, the care taken in shaping the mane and tail. A parent's gift. A child's treasure.

He picked it up. Held it.

The toy was small and light and represented everything the Dominion had taken from this place — not just the people but the possibility of people. The children who would have grown up here. The families that would have formed. The ordinary, beautiful, unremarkable lives that would have been lived.

Torvane appeared beside him. The engineer looked at the toy, then at the ash-oath sigils on the doors. His face was set — the expression of a man processing information he wished he hadn't received.

He didn't say anything. He didn't need to. The toy said everything.

Jagren placed it on a windowsill. Carefully. As though returning it to its owner.

Then he walked on. And something in his chest — something that had been loud and eager and hungry for attention his entire life — went quiet. Not dead. Quieter. Harder. A different kind of purpose settling into the space where glory used to live.

Itzil was watching him from ahead. He met her eyes and saw that she'd seen. She'd seen the toy. She'd seen his face. She'd seen the change.

"Promise me we'll make them pay," he said.

Her expression shifted — not anger, not vengeance. Something steadier.

"Not pay," she said. "Stop. There's a difference."

He hated that she was right. He hated how often she was right. But he nodded, because she was right, and because the difference between paying and stopping was the difference between the fighter he'd been and the one he was becoming.

They moved on. The village disappeared behind them. The road continued south, toward the coast, toward the relic, toward whatever waited at the end of this journey that had started in a fighting pit and led him here — to an empty village with a broken toy and a woman who told him the truth even when the truth was harder than a lie.

The coast was close now. They could smell it — salt and wind and the vast, inhuman patience of the sea. Tomorrow or the next day, they'd reach the temple.

Jagren touched his blade. Not the flashy grip of a performer. The steady grip of someone who'd found a reason to fight that was bigger than applause.

It was heavier than glory. It was also, he was beginning to understand, more real.
