# Chapter 17 — THE BLOOD ORATOR

_POV: Itzil_

---

They reached the coast on the sixth day.

The sea was enormous. Itzil had known this intellectually — she'd read about it, studied maps, understood the geography. But standing on a cliff edge with the ocean spreading to the horizon in every direction, she felt the knowledge transform from information into experience. The water was vast and grey-green and alive, moving with a patient, inhuman rhythm that made everything on land feel temporary.

The coastal temple sat on a promontory half a mile south — a structure of white stone and weathered columns, half-consumed by centuries of salt wind and encroaching sea. It was beautiful in the way that ruins are beautiful: a record of something that was, shaped by the slow erosion of what came after.

Kaelen had scouted ahead. He returned with intelligence that made the beauty irrelevant.

"The Dominion team is already here," he said. "Thirty soldiers camped on the temple approach. Two sorcerers maintaining a defensive perimeter. They arrived yesterday — the temple's external wards are still intact, so they haven't breached the inner sanctum yet."

"Why not?"

"The wards are old. Pre-Dominion. Sun-Blade tradition construction. They're designed to repel dark magic specifically — the sorcerers' standard breach techniques don't work. They're trying to find a workaround."

Itzil processed. The wards were protecting the relic, but they wouldn't hold forever. Dominion sorcerers were resourceful and patient. Given time, they'd find a way through.

"We need to get to the relic before they breach the wards," she said.

"Agreed. But there's a complication." Kaelen's expression was neutral in the way that a still lake is neutral — surface calm hiding depth. "There's someone else with the Dominion team. Not a soldier. Not a sorcerer. A woman in crimson robes who arrived separately, by horse, an hour ago. She walked straight through the camp without stopping and entered the temple's outer ruins."

The cold feeling returned. The one from Korvain's message.

"Nightshade."

"I think so. The soldiers deferred to her. Even the sorcerers." He paused. "She didn't carry a weapon."

They planned the approach during the remaining daylight hours, hidden in a sea cave below the cliffs. The plan was Kaelen's — modified by Itzil, refined by Torvane, and accepted by the group with the grim determination of people who knew the odds and had decided to ignore them.

Phase one: Itzil would enter the temple through a sea-level entrance that Kaelen had identified — a partially submerged passage carved into the promontory's base. The temple's inner sanctum could be accessed from below. The Sun-Blade tradition wards would recognize her as an ally and let her pass.

Phase two: while Itzil was inside, the rest of the team would create a diversion on the landward side — not a direct assault, but harassment. Torvane's devices, Kaelen's scouting, Jagren's combat skills, all directed at making the Dominion think they were under attack from a larger force.

Phase three: Itzil retrieves the Tide Pearl and exits through the sea passage. The team disengages and retreats to the rendezvous point.

Simple. Clean. Full of gaps that Nightshade's presence filled with uncertainty.

"If she's in the outer ruins, she'll be between me and the inner sanctum," Itzil said.

"Yes."

"And she doesn't fight with weapons."

"She fights with words. And blood-magic." Kaelen's voice was flat but his eyes were intense. "Korvain said people who listen to her don't come back. If she speaks to you, don't listen."

"How do you not listen to someone?"

He didn't have an answer for that. None of them did.

Itzil entered the sea passage at dusk.

The water was cold — not the river-cold from the Thornspire escape, but the deep, patient cold of the ocean, the kind that seeped through clothing and skin and settled into bone. The passage was half-flooded, requiring her to wade and then swim through sections where the ceiling dropped to inches above the water's surface. Her pack was waterproofed — Torvane's oilcloth wrapping — and her blade was strapped to her back where it wouldn't impede her movement.

The passage opened into a natural cavern beneath the temple. From here, a stone staircase spiraled upward into the structure proper. The stairs were carved with sun-language glyphs that pulsed faintly as she ascended — the wards recognizing her affinity and granting passage.

She emerged into the temple's ground level. The interior was vast and shadowed — columns supporting a ceiling that had partially collapsed, allowing moonlight to stream through gaps in the stone. The floor was covered in sand and debris from centuries of neglect. Murals on the walls — faded almost to invisibility — depicted scenes of the Sun-Blade tradition's history: warriors in golden armor, blades of light, the sealing of the Great Gate.

She moved through the outer chambers toward the inner sanctum. Her footsteps were quiet on the sand. Her hand rested on her blade's hilt. The Sun-Blade hummed in her palms — not manifested, but present, like a voice in the next room.

She rounded a column and stopped.

Nightshade stood in the center of the main hall.

She was not what Itzil had expected. Not a monster. Not a creature of obvious malice. She was a woman — perhaps forty, perhaps older — with dark hair pulled back from a face that was striking in its composure. She wore robes of deep crimson that moved like liquid when she breathed. She had no weapons. She had no guards. She stood alone in the moonlit hall with her hands clasped before her and a smile that was warm and terrible in equal measure.

"Hello," she said. Her voice was beautiful — rich, musical, intimate. It slid into Itzil's mind like silk over a knife. "You must be the blade-bearer."

Every instinct screamed: *don't respond*. Kaelen's warning. Korvain's message. The intelligence that described this woman as someone who didn't fight — she talked, and people who listened didn't come back.

Itzil drew her sword — the steel one, not the Sun-Blade. Keep the golden weapon hidden. Don't reveal capabilities. Basic tactics.

"Step aside," she said.

Nightshade didn't move. Her smile deepened, and the warmth in it was the warmth of a fire that invited you to step closer and closer until the flames were all you could see.

"I know your name, Itzil. I know about your temple on Mount Solara. I know about Korvain — such a good man, such a tired one. I know about Amalura, sharp and brilliant and so very afraid of losing what little she has left."

The words landed like strikes. Each one precise. Each one carrying information that no one outside the temple should possess.

"I know about your scout — Kaelen, the last survivor, carrying his dead like stones in his chest. And the duelist — Jagren, so desperate to matter that he'd follow anyone who promised him significance."

She stepped closer. One step. Her robes whispered against the stone floor.

"I know you're afraid, Itzil. I know you don't believe you're enough. I know the prophecy feels like a chain rather than a calling, and I know that every night when you practice the Sun-Blade in the dark, you're not training — you're praying. Praying that the light means something. That you mean something."

Itzil's grip on her sword tightened. Her palms were sweating. The accuracy of Nightshade's words was surgical — not guesses but insights, drawn from intelligence she shouldn't have and delivered with an empathy that felt genuine.

That was the horror of it. Nightshade wasn't lying. She wasn't manipulating through falsehood. She was manipulating through TRUTH — weaponizing real observations, real insights, real compassion to build a bridge that the listener would walk across willingly.

"I'm offering you a deal," Nightshade said. Her voice was soft now — the softness of a mother comforting a frightened child. "Surrender the blade. Walk away. Take your little team and go home. No one else has to die."

She spread her hands — empty, open, unthreatening.

"I'm giving you a kindness, Itzil. Take it."

The silence that followed was the loudest thing Itzil had ever heard.

She thought about the destroyed village. The ash-oath sigils on every door. The child's toy on the windowsill. She thought about Neyla's family — eyes blank, souls burned out, puppets on crimson strings. She thought about the seven ash-oathed villagers in Solquetal's town square, still standing there, still waiting for commands that would never come.

She thought about kindness. About what kindness meant when it came from someone who built her career on erasing people's minds and calling it peace.

"Kindness from you," Itzil said, "comes with chains."

Nightshade's smile changed. Not colder — more interested. The way a craftsman's expression changes when a piece of work reveals unexpected complexity.

"I like you," she said. "You'll be interesting to break."

She raised one hand. The air between them rippled — blood-magic gathering, invisible but palpable, a pressure that pushed against Itzil's skin and tried to find a way in through her pores, her breath, the thin membranes of her eyes.

Itzil manifested the Sun-Blade.

Not deliberately — instinctively. The golden light erupted from her palm and shaped itself into a blade that cut through the blood-magic pressure like dawn through fog. The crimson ripple shattered. Nightshade stepped back — the first involuntary movement Itzil had seen from her.

The Sun-Blade blazed in the moonlit hall. Its light was fierce, unstable, pulsing with the raw emotion that Itzil was channeling — fear and determination and the specific fury of someone who had been told the truth about their weaknesses and refused to be broken by it.

Nightshade's composure returned — quickly, professionally. She studied the blade with the clinical detachment of someone cataloging a new threat.

"A real blade. Remarkable." She stepped back again. "We'll meet again, Itzil. And next time, I'll know what you are."

She vanished. Not through a door — through a portal of crimson light that opened behind her and swallowed her whole. Blood-magic teleportation. She was there, and then she was not, and the hall was empty except for Itzil and the golden light and the echo of a voice that would live in her nightmares for months.

The Sun-Blade guttered. Itzil let it die. Her hands were shaking. Her heart was hammering. She felt exposed — not physically but psychically, as though Nightshade had peeled back a layer of skin and looked at the raw tissue beneath.

She breathed. In through the nose. Out through the mouth. The way Korvain had taught her. Slowly. Steadily.

Then she moved deeper into the temple. The inner sanctum was ahead. The Tide Pearl was waiting.

And behind her, in the space where Nightshade had stood, the air still smelled of crimson silk and the particular poison of a kindness that meant: *surrender your soul, and I'll let your body live*.

No deal.
