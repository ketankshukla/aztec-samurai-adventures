# Chapter 19 — NIGHTSHADE'S REPORT

_POV: Nightshade_

---

The blood-mirror showed Volzentar's face in crimson light, his features rendered in the liquid medium that served as both communication device and surveillance tool. The mirror was the size of a dinner plate, held in a frame of black iron, and it reflected not light but presence — the specific biological resonance of the person on the other end.

Nightshade knelt before it in her private tent, pitched a mile from the coastal temple's ruins. The Dominion soldiers were still working on breaching the inner sanctum. They would succeed eventually. When they did, they would find the pedestal empty and the Tide Pearl gone.

"The bearer is real," Nightshade said.

Volzentar's image was still. His silver eyes held the same evaluative patience that characterized every interaction she'd had with him over fifteen years of service. He did not rush to conclusions. He gathered data. He waited until the picture was complete.

"Describe her."

"Young. Early twenties. Trained in the Sun-Blade tradition — standard forms, solid technique, nothing exceptional in conventional terms." She paused. Chose her next words with the precision of someone who understood that inaccuracy in a report to Volzentar was not merely unprofessional but potentially fatal. "The blade manifestation is genuine. Unstable — she's early in the development process. But the core resonance is strong. Possibly the strongest I've ever encountered."

"Stronger than the historical records?"

"Comparable to the records of Solara. Possibly exceeding them, given the instability — high power, low control suggests a ceiling that hasn't been reached yet."

Volzentar processed this. The mirror's crimson light shifted slightly — a function of his emotional state bleeding through the biological connection. He was interested. Not alarmed — Volzentar was never alarmed. But interested in the way that a chess player is interested when the opponent makes an unexpected move.

"And the team?"

"A scout — Kaelen, formerly of the border reconnaissance corps. Competent. The best tracker I've seen. He planned the infiltration of the temple — sophisticated work for a field operative."

"The Thornspire incident."

"Almost certainly. The intelligence breach matches his operational signature."

"Continue."

"A duelist — Jagren, from the warrior camps. Exceptionally fast. Limited combat experience outside the arena, but he's learning quickly. An engineer — Torvane, independent contractor. He builds countermeasures specifically designed for our technology. His ward-disruptor suppressed our detection system for nearly fifteen seconds."

Volzentar's eyes narrowed. Fractionally. "Fifteen seconds."

"Yes. And a healer — Neyla, from the eastern refugee camps. This one concerns me most. She has abilities that I've never encountered — her healing magic interfaces with blood-magic channels. She disrupted my tracking during the infiltration. I believe she can sense and potentially influence blood-magic constructs."

The mirror was silent for five seconds. In Volzentar's economy of response, five seconds was an entire conversation.

"The healer threatens the ash-oath network," he said.

"If she can influence blood-magic, she may be able to disrupt ash-oaths. Potentially reverse them."

Another silence. Longer.

"And the Tide Pearl?"

"Gone. The bearer accessed the inner sanctum through a subterranean passage. The tradition wards recognized her and granted entry. By the time our breach team reached the sanctum, the relic was extracted."

"So. A Sun-Blade bearer with a genuine blade. A scout who can breach our intelligence infrastructure. An engineer who can suppress our defenses. A healer who threatens our most critical magical system. And they now possess a sacred relic." Volzentar's voice was measured, analytical, entirely without panic. "This is a more coherent threat than I anticipated."

"My assessment as well."

"What do you recommend?"

Nightshade had been composing her recommendation since the moment the golden blade had shattered her blood-magic in the temple hall. She delivered it with the clinical precision that Volzentar valued above all other qualities.

"The bearer's weakness is psychological. She doubts herself. The prophecy is a weight, not a wings. Her team is the real threat — they compensate for her individual limitations. Destroy the team, and the bearer becomes a lonely girl with a glowing sword. Powerful but directionless."

"You want to target the team."

"I want to separate them. Isolation is more devastating than assassination. Kill a team member and you create a martyr. Isolate them and you create doubt." She leaned forward, her face catching the crimson light. "Let me work, my lord. Give me time and access to our field assets. I'll pull them apart."

Volzentar considered. The mirror pulsed.

"Denied."

Nightshade's composure held, but only just. "My lord?"

"Your approach is sound in principle but premature in execution. We don't know enough about this team yet. Your encounter with the bearer was valuable but incomplete — you tested her resolve and found it sufficient. Now we need to test the team's capabilities under greater stress."

He leaned back, and the mirror's perspective shifted slightly, revealing the throne room behind him. "Deploy Gravok."

The name landed in the tent like a thrown axe. Gravok was not subtle. Gravok was not sophisticated. Gravok was thirty tons of war-beast fury aimed at a target and released.

"Gravok's beast army against a five-person team is excessive force," Nightshade said carefully.

"It's a test. I want to see how they fight when outnumbered and outmatched. I want to see the bearer use the blade under combat stress. I want to see how the scout reacts, how the engineer improvises, how the healer performs under fire." His eyes gleamed. "And I want to see if they break. Because if they can survive Gravok, then your approach — the surgical, psychological approach — becomes the correct strategy. If they break under brute force, we save ourselves the elegance."

The logic was, as always, impeccable. Nightshade hated it. She hated it because it relegated her to an observer while Gravok's beasts did the messy work, and she hated it because Volzentar was right.

"As you wish," she said.

"One more thing." Volzentar's voice dropped — not in volume but in register, the way it did when he was about to say something that mattered. "The healer. Neyla. If she can truly reverse ash-oaths, she is the single greatest threat to our infrastructure. The ash-oath network represents fifteen years of acquisition. Tens of thousands of souls. It powers our war effort, our economy, our communication systems."

He leaned forward. The crimson light filled his features, turning them into a mask of shadow and blood-light.

"If the healer can undo that... eliminate her. I don't care how. I don't care when. But she does not survive this war."

The mirror went dark. The crimson light faded. Nightshade knelt in her tent, alone, surrounded by the cold salt air and the distant sound of surf.

She thought about the bearer. The golden blade. The determination in those young eyes. The refusal to accept a kindness that had chains attached.

She thought about the healer. The quiet woman who could sense blood-magic and might — might — be able to reach into the most powerful weapon in the Dominion's arsenal and pull it apart thread by thread.

She thought about Volzentar's order. Eliminate the healer.

Nightshade stood. Brushed the sand from her robes. Walked out of the tent into the night air, where the ocean crashed against the promontory and the stars burned in a sky that didn't care about empires or relics or the small, desperate people fighting over both.

Gravok's beasts would be deployed within the week. The test would come. And after the test — regardless of its outcome — Nightshade would do what she did best.

She would find their fears. She would find their fault lines. And she would apply precisely enough pressure to make them crack.

It was, after all, what she was for.
