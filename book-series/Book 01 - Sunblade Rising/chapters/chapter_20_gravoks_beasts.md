# Chapter 20 — GRAVOK'S BEASTS

_POV: Itzil_

---

They heard the beasts before they saw them.

The sound came from the east — a low, rhythmic tremor that Itzil felt through the ground before she heard it through the air. Not footsteps. Not hooves. Something heavier. Something that moved in groups and shook the earth with the accumulated weight of creatures that evolution had not designed and nature had not intended.

Kaelen was on his feet before the second tremor. His spyglass was out, aimed at the ridgeline a mile east. His face, usually controlled to the point of blankness, showed something she'd never seen on it before.

"Run," he said.

"What—"

"NOW."

They ran.

Not the disciplined retreat of a military unit disengaging from contact. This was flight — raw, undignified, driven by the sound that was growing behind them like a tide of noise. Kaelen led them north, away from the road, into terrain that offered cover and obstacles. Rocky ground. Dense forest. A dry streambed that cut through the landscape like a trench.

They made it two hundred yards before the first beast crested the ridgeline.

Itzil looked back. She shouldn't have.

It was the size of a house. That was the first thing — the sheer, incomprehensible scale of a living creature that occupied more space than most buildings. It was built like a bull, if a bull had been designed by someone who thought bulls were too small and too gentle. Massive shoulders. Armored hide — not natural armor but grafted plate, bolted to the creature's skin in overlapping layers of dark steel. Tusks that curved forward from a jaw wide enough to swallow a horse. Eyes that burned with a dull crimson light — the signature of dark magic, the mark of a creature that was as much sorcery as biology.

Behind it: more. She counted five before the forest swallowed her view. Five war-beasts, each the size of the first, moving in formation with the disciplined coordination that marked them as controlled — not wild creatures but weapons, directed by a handler's will.

And behind the beasts, on a platform strapped to the back of the largest one, a figure. Massive, scarred, armored in a style that was half-plate and half-trophy — pieces of enemy equipment welded to a base frame, creating an armor that was part protection and part memorial to every opponent its wearer had destroyed.

Gravok. The Beast Commander.

"Into the streambed!" Kaelen shouted, and the team dove for cover.

The dry streambed was four feet deep — enough to hide them from direct observation but not from the beasts' other senses. The creatures tracked by vibration, by scent, by the blood-magic resonance that their handlers used to mark targets. Running wouldn't save them. Distance was temporary. The beasts were faster over open ground.

"Options," Itzil gasped, pressing her back against the streambed's earth wall.

"Limited." Kaelen was already calculating. "Five war-beasts, plus handlers. Gravok on the lead beast. Standard deployment is eight support infantry per beast — that's forty soldiers behind them."

"Forty soldiers and five war-beasts against eight people."

"The math is bad."

"Torvane." Itzil looked at the engineer, who was already rummaging in his pack. "Tell me you have something."

"I have several somethings. None of them are designed to stop a creature that weighs more than a house." He pulled out three cylindrical devices — his explosive charges. "These will damage but not disable. The armor plating on those beasts is military-grade — my charges can crack it but not penetrate."

"Can you slow them?"

"I can annoy them. Which might be worse."

The ground shook. The beasts were close — two hundred yards, maybe less. The sound was a continuous rumble now, the vibration traveling up through the streambed walls and into their bodies.

"The streambed runs north for half a mile," Kaelen said, reading the terrain from memory. "It empties into a gorge — narrow, deep, too tight for the beasts to follow. If we can reach the gorge, we're clear."

"Half a mile."

"At a sprint."

"With beasts behind us."

"The math is bad," he repeated. "But it's the only math we have."

---

They ran. Along the streambed, crouching low, moving as fast as the uneven footing allowed. The beasts followed above — their handlers directing them along the ridgelines on either side, herding the quarry like wolves herding deer.

Gravok's voice boomed across the landscape — amplified by blood-magic or simply by the sheer volume of a man whose chest was the size of a barrel.

"LITTLE WARRIORS! I SMELL YOU! THE BEASTS SMELL YOU! THERE IS NOWHERE TO RUN THAT THEY CANNOT FOLLOW!"

Itzil ignored the voice. Focused on moving. One foot after another, the streambed narrowing as they went, the gorge ahead visible as a dark slash in the terrain.

A beast dropped into the streambed.

Not climbed — dropped. It had jumped from the ridge, a distance of twenty feet, and landed in the streambed with an impact that knocked everyone off their feet. The creature filled the passage completely — a wall of armored flesh and crimson eyes, blocking their path.

It lowered its tusks. The ground shook.

"TORVANE!" Itzil screamed.

The engineer threw a charge. It struck the beast's chest plate and detonated — a sharp, contained explosion that cracked the armor and drove the creature back three steps. Not enough to disable. Enough to stagger.

Jagren moved. Fast — faster than she'd ever seen him. The stripped-down technique Kaelen had taught him was pure efficiency: he charged the staggered beast, ducked under the tusks, and drove his blade into the gap between the cracked chest plate and the neck armor. The blade bit deep. The beast screamed — a sound that shattered thought and turned the air solid.

"MOVE!" Jagren pulled the blade free and ran. The beast thrashed, wounded but not dead, blocking the streambed with its massive body as the team scrambled past on either side.

The gorge was a hundred yards ahead. Then fifty. Then twenty.

A second beast appeared above them — on the ridgeline, silhouetted against the sky, looking down. Its handler, mounted on its back, raised a hand that crackled with dark energy.

The sorcerer-handler threw a bolt of crimson fire. It struck the streambed wall, showering them with dirt and stone. A second bolt followed, closer.

Neyla cried out. A fragment of stone had caught her forearm, opening a gash that bled freely. She stumbled. Tuli caught her — the young warrior's wounded shoulder screaming in protest but her grip absolute.

"KEEP MOVING!" Itzil drew the Sun-Blade.

The golden light erupted in the streambed — fierce, unstable, blazing with everything she felt. Fear. Fury. The desperate need to protect the people behind her. The blade was three feet of liquid gold that hummed with a frequency the beasts could feel.

They felt it. The beast on the ridgeline flinched. Its handler yanked the reins, but the creature refused to advance — the Sun-Blade's energy was antithetical to the dark magic that controlled it. The crimson light in its eyes flickered. The handler's control weakened.

Itzil raised the blade. The light intensified. The beast on the ridgeline backed away — one step, two, three — pulling its handler with it.

The team reached the gorge. They plunged into the narrow passage — barely wide enough for two people abreast, the walls rising thirty feet on either side. The beasts couldn't follow. The war-beasts milled at the gorge's entrance, screaming in frustration, their handlers shouting commands that the Sun-Blade's residual energy made them reluctant to obey.

Gravok's voice echoed down the gorge, distorted by the stone walls.

"RUN, LITTLE BLADE-BEARER! THE BEASTS WILL WAIT! I WILL WAIT! THERE IS ALWAYS NEXT TIME!"

---

They emerged from the gorge's far end a mile later, stumbling into a forest that the war-beasts couldn't navigate and the infantry couldn't reach without a three-hour detour.

The team collapsed. Not strategically — physically. They dropped where they stood, gasping, bleeding, trembling with the aftermath of sustained terror.

Itzil let the Sun-Blade die. Her hand was hot, tingling, exhausted. The manifestation had lasted nearly three minutes under combat stress — far longer than any training session. The blade had been stronger, steadier, more defined. Not because she'd practiced more, but because she'd needed it more. The golden light responded to genuine need — to the real, desperate desire to protect the people behind her.

Korvain's words: *Fight to protect. There's a difference.*

She understood now.

Neyla treated the team's injuries — her own forearm first, then Tuli's reopened shoulder, then assorted cuts and bruises from the streambed scramble. She worked with focused efficiency, her hands glowing faintly with healing magic that Itzil could now see was tinged with blue-silver — the Tide Pearl's influence, resonating with the healer's own power.

"Everyone alive?" Itzil asked.

"Alive," Kaelen confirmed, the word carrying the specific gravity of someone who cataloged every alternative.

"Gravok won't follow through the forest," he continued. "War-beasts are open-ground weapons. But he'll circle. He'll set up a cordon. We need to move tonight."

"We will." Itzil looked at her team. Battered. Shaken. Alive.

They'd survived a war-beast assault. Five beasts. Forty soldiers. The Beast Commander himself. And they were still here.

"This was a test," she said. "Gravok didn't attack us to capture the relic. He attacked to see what we could do."

"Agreed." Kaelen's voice was grim. "Which means someone told him where to find us. Someone with intelligence about our movements."

Nightshade. The name hung unspoken between them.

The blood orator had found them. Tracked them. And now she'd sent the beasts to take their measure. The next attack wouldn't be a test. It would be the real thing.

"We move," Itzil said. "North. Back to the temple. Back to Korvain."

They moved. Through the forest. Through the night. Through the dawning understanding that they were no longer anonymous — that the Dominion knew who they were, what they could do, and where they were going.

The race had become a hunt. And they were no longer the hunters.
