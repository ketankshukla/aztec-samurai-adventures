# Chapter 23 — THE WAR COUNCIL

_POV: Itzil_

---

The war council convened in the temple's main hall on the tenth day of their return.

The hall was larger than the team required — designed for full temple assemblies of fifty disciples and staff, now occupied by eight warriors, two elders, and the particular tension that fills a room when every person in it knows that the decisions made here will determine whether they live or die.

Korvain presided from the head of the low table, his staff laid across his knees. Amalura sat beside him, surrounded by scrolls and texts she'd been cross-referencing for ten straight days. The team arranged themselves around the table — Itzil at Korvain's right, Kaelen at her right, and the others filling in with the organic hierarchy that had developed over the past month. No one had assigned seats. No one needed to.

"Status," Korvain said.

Itzil spoke first. "We hold one relic — the Tide Pearl. It's secured in the vault, behind wards that Amalura has reinforced. The Dominion holds three: the Ember Core, the Voidglass, and one we haven't identified. Three relics remain unaccounted for."

Amalura took over. She'd been researching without pause since the team's return, fueled by the intelligence from Thornspire and her own formidable archives. Sleep, she'd informed anyone who asked, was an inefficiency she'd address when the world was less imperiled.

"The Starshard is in the Shattered Peaks fortress. Confirmed. The Dominion's retrieval team is en route — fifty soldiers, four sorcerers. They'll reach the fortress within two weeks."

She unrolled a new map — one she'd drawn herself, incorporating the Thornspire intelligence with her own research. "The Heartstone from Brightfall remains missing. The Dominion excavated the temple ruins and found nothing. My theory: the Brightfall elders hid the relic before the temple fell. A secondary vault, location unknown."

"And the last two?"

"The Sunheart and the Dawnchain." She tapped two locations on the map — both marked with question marks. "Historical records place the Sunheart in a temple complex in the deep south — beyond the contested zone, in territory the Dominion hasn't reached. The Dawnchain's location is genuinely unknown. The last reliable record is two hundred years old and references a 'vault beneath the sea,' which could mean a dozen things."

Kaelen leaned forward. "The Dominion's priorities, based on the intelligence: Starshard first, then sweep for the remaining relics using the captured scholar's knowledge."

"The captured scholar," Korvain said. His voice carried weight. "Varshan, from Brightfall. He knows more about relic locations than anyone alive. If the Dominion extracts that knowledge, they'll find every relic before we do."

The room absorbed this. The strategic picture was clear: whoever controlled the information controlled the race. And right now, the Dominion had the better hand.

"We need allies," Itzil said. "Not just fighters — governments. Armies. Resources. Five people can raid an outpost and steal a relic. Five people cannot fight a continental war."

Korvain nodded. "I've sent messages to the surviving Sun-Blade temples. Two have responded — both small, both frightened, but both willing to coordinate. I've also reached out to the three independent kingdoms that border the Dominion's territory."

"And?"

"Mixed responses. The kingdom of Thalendor is interested — their military council has been watching the Dominion's expansion with increasing alarm. Pyrrath is sympathetic but cautious. Coravel is non-committal."

"They're afraid," Neyla said quietly. Everyone turned to her. She rarely spoke in tactical discussions, but when she did, the room listened. "They've seen what the Dominion does to people who resist. The ash-oaths. The blank eyes. They're not being cautious. They're terrified."

"Then we show them there's a reason not to be terrified," Itzil said. She placed the Tide Pearl on the table. Its blue-silver light pulsed in the dim hall, casting soft shadows across the maps and scrolls. "We have a relic. We have a blade-bearer. We have intelligence on the Dominion's plans. We have something to offer that fear can't buy: a chance."

Korvain studied her. The evaluation was familiar — the same deep, penetrating assessment he'd given her every day of training for ten years. But something had shifted in it. He was no longer measuring her against what she could become. He was measuring her against what she was.

"The Starshard," he said. "You want to go after it."

"Before the Dominion. We intercept their retrieval team or we reach the fortress first. Either way, we deny them a fourth relic."

"The fortress is heavily warded. Ancient defenses. The Dominion is sending fifty soldiers and four sorcerers because they expect significant resistance."

"We don't need fifty soldiers. We need the right five people." She looked at her team. "We've proven we can operate behind enemy lines. Thornspire. The coastal temple. The war-beast escape. We're small, fast, and we have capabilities the Dominion hasn't accounted for."

She held up the Tide Pearl. "We also have this. If the relics are keys, they might interact with each other. The Tide Pearl might help us access the Starshard's protections — Sun-Blade tradition wards recognizing a sister relic."

Amalura's eye brightened. "That's... actually a compelling theory. The relics were forged together. They share a resonance signature. One might indeed serve as a credential for another."

Torvane produced his notebook. "I've spent the last ten days redesigning my equipment based on what we learned. Improved ward-disruptors with longer range and duration. Explosive charges optimized for war-beast armor. Signal jammers that can interrupt blood-magic communication over a wider area." He flipped to a specific page. "And this — a portable resonance amplifier. If the Tide Pearl can interact with the Starshard's wards, this device will boost the signal. Turn a whisper into a shout."

Kaelen had been listening with the focused attention he gave to every tactical discussion. "The route to the Shattered Peaks runs through territory I've mapped extensively. I can get us there in twelve days — faster than the Dominion's team, which is taking the main roads."

Jagren: "And when we get there, I fight whatever needs fighting."

Neyla: "And I keep everyone alive while they do."

The room was charged — the particular energy of people who had found a purpose and were eager to pursue it. Itzil felt it — the electricity of aligned will, the power of a group that had moved past the cautious, tentative phase and entered the phase where they trusted each other enough to run toward danger together.

She looked at Korvain. He held her gaze.

"Permission to proceed?" she asked.

His eyes held something she'd never seen in them before. Not approval — he'd shown her approval before, in small doses, carefully rationed. This was different. This was pride. Raw, undisguised, the pride of a mentor watching his student become the thing he'd always believed she could be.

"You don't need my permission," he said. "You haven't needed it for a while."

She stood. The team stood with her — automatically, instinctively, the way a body responds to a nerve's signal.

"We leave in four days. Use the time to prepare. Rest. Train. Resupply." She looked at each of them. "This will be harder than anything we've done. The Shattered Peaks fortress. Fifty Dominion soldiers. Ancient wards. War-beasts, probably."

She manifested the Sun-Blade. It blazed in the hall — golden light filling the ancient space, casting the sun-language inscriptions on the walls in sharp relief. The light was steady. Controlled. Beautiful.

"We can do this," she said. "Because we've been doing it. Every day, every step, every fight — we've been doing the impossible. Not because we're the strongest or the fastest or the smartest. Because we're the ones who showed up."

The blade pulsed. The team pulsed with it — a resonance of purpose that was not magical but felt that way. Five warriors, two elders, and a blade of golden light, standing in a temple on a mountain while the world below them tilted toward darkness.

They would fight. They would show up. They would do the impossible, again and again, until the impossible became ordinary and the ordinary became legendary.

That was the plan. It wasn't much.

It was everything.
