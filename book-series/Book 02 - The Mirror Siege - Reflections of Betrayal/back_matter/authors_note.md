# Author's Note

Thank you for reading *The Mirror Siege*.

This book was about mirrors — not the kind that hang on walls, but the kind that live inside people. The reflections we see when we look at ourselves honestly. The distortions that guilt and fear create when we refuse to look. The moment when someone holds up a mirror and shows us who we actually are, not who we've been pretending to be.

Kaelen's journey in this book is about putting down the weight of ghosts he's been carrying. Not forgetting them — never forgetting — but learning that carrying guilt is not the same as honoring the dead. The dead don't need our suffering. They need us to live.

Miyako's return from decades of hiding is a reminder that it's never too late to stop running. That the bravest thing a person can do is not fight — it's decide to fight after spending years convinced they couldn't.

And Itzil's growth from reluctant warrior to genuine commander is the heart of the series. She doesn't lead because she's perfect. She leads because she shows up, makes the hard calls, and refuses to sacrifice the people she's sworn to protect — even when the math says she should.

The war is widening. The stakes are rising. The Great Gate is cracking, and what waits on the other side is patient and hungry and older than civilization. But the team is stronger than it was, and the alliance is growing, and the Sun-Blade burns brighter with every battle.

Book 3 takes us deeper — into the world of ash-oaths, into the courts of the neutral nations, and into the choices that define what kind of people we become when the cost of doing right is higher than the cost of doing nothing.

I hope you'll continue the journey.

With gratitude,
Ketan Shukla
