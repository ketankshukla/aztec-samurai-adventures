# Aztec Samurai Adventures Book 2: The Mirror Siege - Reflections of Betrayal

What if the enemy's greatest weapon wasn't an army — but a door?

Kaelen is a scout. The best the alliance has. The last survivor of a reconnaissance unit wiped out by a Dominion ambush, he carries eleven ghosts on his back and the unshakeable conviction that the only person he can trust with a mission is himself. When Gravok — the Dominion's Beast Commander — marches twelve thousand soldiers toward three allied cities with a force multiplier that shouldn't exist, Kaelen is sent behind enemy lines to find it and destroy it.

What he finds changes everything.

Mirror-portals — shimmering doorways that fold space and allow instant troop movement across a continent. Powered by a crystallized human soul trapped in a glass house on a hill. Built by Dalrignon, the Dominion's Portal Engineer, a man who sees atrocity as innovation and suffering as a variable in an equation.

With the help of Miyako — a grey-haired exile from the Sun-Blade's lost shadow school who has been sabotaging the Dominion from the inside for months — Kaelen infiltrates the glass house, destroys the anchor, and collapses the portal network. The siege of three cities becomes a fair fight. Itzil leads the counterattack. Gravok falls. The alliance wins its first major victory.

But the victory reveals a deeper truth. The mirror-portals were toys — crude imitations of an ancient technology that predates the Dominion by a thousand years. The Great Gate, sealed beneath the Dominion capital, is the source. And on the other side of the Gate, something vast and hungry has been guiding the empire toward reopening it for centuries.

The Weeping One — a demon-bound seer imprisoned beneath the Dominion palace — sees everything. Past, present, future. She weeps because the Gate will open. She weeps because the Hunger will come. And she weeps because the only variable in an otherwise fixed equation is a team of seven people with a blade of golden light and the stubborn refusal to accept that the odds are impossible.

The mirrors are broken. The siege is won. But the war has widened, and the horizon is darker than anyone imagined.
