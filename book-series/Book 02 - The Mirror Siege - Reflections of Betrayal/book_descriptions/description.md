# Book Description — Aztec Samurai Adventures Book 2: The Mirror Siege - Reflections of Betrayal

## Subtitle: Reflections of Betrayal

---

<b>The portals open. The army teleports. And the only person who can stop it is a wounded scout with eleven ghosts on his back.</b>

<p>When the Dominion's Beast Commander marches twelve thousand soldiers toward three allied cities — armed with mirror-portals that allow instant troop movement across a continent — Kaelen goes behind enemy lines alone to find the source and destroy it. What he discovers is worse than a weapon. It's a prison. A human soul, crystallized and trapped, powering a network of doorways built by a man who calls suffering "innovation."</p>

<p>With the help of Miyako, a grey-haired exile from the Sun-Blade's lost shadow school, Kaelen must infiltrate the glass house, shatter the anchor, and collapse the portal network before Gravok's army overwhelms three cities simultaneously.</p>

<p><b>In this book:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>A scout carrying the guilt of eleven dead teammates must learn to let go of his ghosts — or be consumed by them</li>
<li>A lost master of the shadow school emerges from decades of hiding to teach an ancient technique that bends light around stillness</li>
<li>The Sun-Blade bearer faces her greatest military challenge: defending three cities against an enemy that can teleport</li>
<li>A villain POV reveals the Dominion's Portal Engineer — a brilliant, amoral genius who builds abominations and calls them progress</li>
<li>The Weeping One speaks — a demon-bound seer who sees all timelines and weeps because the Gate will open</li>
<li>A healer discovers that her magic can touch ash-oaths — the first crack in the Dominion's most terrible weapon</li>
</ul>

<p>The Mirror Siege is the second book in an epic fantasy series that combines the warrior traditions of Mesoamerica with the disciplined philosophy of the samurai. The mirrors are shattered. The siege is won. But the real war — against an intelligence older than civilization, pressing against a sealed door — has only just begun.</p>

<p>For fans of <i>The Poppy War</i>, <i>The Blade Itself</i>, and <i>The Name of the Wind</i> — a series where the most dangerous weapon isn't the sharpest sword. It's the truth you've been hiding from yourself.</p>

<p><i>The mirrors are broken. The horizon widens. And the door is cracking.</i></p>

<p><b>Book 2 of 12 in the <i>Aztec Samurai Adventures</i> series. From Ketan Shukla, published by Metronagon.</b></p>
