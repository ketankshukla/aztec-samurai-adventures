# Chapter 1 Summary — THE ARMY ON THE MOVE

**POV:** Itzil

Itzil convenes a war council as Gravok's army of twelve thousand crosses the Ember River, marching toward three allied cities. Kaelen reports the enemy's unexpected speed and suspects a force multiplier. Commander Rethane argues they can't defend all three cities simultaneously, and Korvain's message advises choosing two to save.

Itzil refuses to abandon any city. She assigns Rethane to Aravalle, Jagren to Sundrift, and a skeleton crew to Ironpool. She sends Kaelen behind enemy lines to find and destroy Gravok's force multiplier, despite his unhealed wounds from a previous encounter.

**Key Events:** War council convened, three-city defense planned, Kaelen assigned to infiltration mission, Itzil chooses to defend all three cities against Korvain's advice.

**Cliffhanger:** Kaelen departs alone into Dominion territory, wounded and carrying the weight of a mission that could determine the fate of three cities.
