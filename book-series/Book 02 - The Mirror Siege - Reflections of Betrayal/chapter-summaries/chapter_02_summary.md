# Chapter 2 Summary — MIRRORS AND SMOKE

**POV:** Kaelen

Kaelen crosses the Ember River into Dominion territory disguised as a trader. He observes the devastation of occupied land — burned fields, ash-oathed slaves standing motionless, and the heavy silence of emptied countryside. He reaches Gravok's forward camp and observes from a ridge.

He discovers twenty-six mirror-portals — shimmering vertical doorways that allow instant troop transport across continental distances. This is Gravok's force multiplier: the ability to concentrate his entire army on any target within hours. While withdrawing, Kaelen is spotted by Gravok himself on a war-beast. He escapes using Torvane's flash-powder but reopens his wounds.

He staggers into the allied outpost at dusk and collapses in the command tent after delivering two words to Itzil: "Mirror portals."

**Key Events:** Kaelen infiltrates Dominion territory, discovers mirror-portals, encounters Gravok, escapes with critical intelligence, collapses from wounds.

**Cliffhanger:** Kaelen collapses after delivering the two-word warning that changes the entire strategic picture.
