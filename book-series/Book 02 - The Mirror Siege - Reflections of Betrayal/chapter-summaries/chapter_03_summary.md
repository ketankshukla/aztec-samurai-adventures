# Chapter 3 Summary — THE BEAST COMMANDER

**POV:** Kaelen / Neyla

Kaelen wakes in the medical tent with Neyla healing his reopened claw marks. She briefs him on the team's response to his intelligence — Rethane is redesigning defenses, Torvane is building detection equipment, and Jagren has marched for Sundrift. Kaelen insists on returning behind enemy lines to find the portal network's central anchor.

Itzil and Kaelen discuss the mission outside the command tent. She reluctantly authorizes his infiltration, ordering twelve-hour signal reports and threatening to send a rescue team if he misses two consecutive check-ins. The emotional weight between them — unspoken but present — deepens as Kaelen departs into Dominion territory alone at dusk.

**Key Events:** Kaelen's wounds treated by Neyla, team's response to portal intelligence, Kaelen authorized for deep infiltration, emotional exchange with Itzil.

**Cliffhanger:** Kaelen walks alone into Dominion territory, heading deeper than he's ever been, to find an anchor he's never seen.
