# Chapter 4 Summary — THREE-FRONT DEFENSE

**POV:** Itzil

Itzil convenes a full war council to present the mirror-portal intelligence and redesign the three-city defense. Torvane presents his signal mirror relay system for rapid communication between cities. Itzil assigns forces: 5,000 to Aravalle under Rethane, 2,500 to Sundrift under Jagren, and 1,000 to Ironpool with Torvane's detection equipment and Neyla's field hospital.

After the council, Amalura confronts Itzil about her worry for Kaelen, observing that her concern goes beyond tactical necessity. Kaelen's first signal arrives at midnight — seventeen words confirming he's moving north and searching for the anchor. Itzil stands on the walls of Aravalle, waiting.

**Key Events:** War council redesigns defense, Torvane's signal mirrors deployed, three-city garrison assignments, Amalura challenges Itzil about Kaelen, first signal received.

**Cliffhanger:** Itzil waits on the walls for dawn and the war that's coming, holding Kaelen's seventeen-word message like a talisman.
