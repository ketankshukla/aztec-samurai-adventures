# Chapter 5 Summary — THE OCCUPIED TOWN

**POV:** Kaelen

Kaelen reaches the occupied town of Mirravale, disguised as a trader. He observes the three layers of Dominion occupation: order (clean streets, maintained buildings), compliance (voluntary ash-oath symbols worn by civilians), and fear (conversations stopping when soldiers pass). He works the market, gathering intelligence about a mysterious "glass house" on a hill above town that appeared overnight three months ago.

Through careful questioning, he learns about Miyako — a grey-haired calligraphy teacher who has been covertly sabotaging Dominion operations, including shattering forty ash-oath crystals using sound resonance. He finds her hiding spot in a tannery basement, where she puts a knife to his throat before he proves his alliance credentials with Korvain's obsidian token.

Miyako reveals she was a Sun-Blade master from the shadow school tradition — a branch that emphasized subtlety and invisibility. She tells Kaelen the glass house is a machine, and the mirror-anchor inside it is a prison containing a living soul.

**Key Events:** Kaelen infiltrates Mirravale, discovers the glass house, learns about Miyako's sabotage, meets Miyako, learns the anchor is powered by a trapped human soul.

**Cliffhanger:** Miyako reveals the anchor is not a device but a prison — and the prisoner is still alive.
