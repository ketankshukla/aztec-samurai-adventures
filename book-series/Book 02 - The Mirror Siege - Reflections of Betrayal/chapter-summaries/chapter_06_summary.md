# Chapter 6 Summary — THE EXILE SENSEI

**POV:** Kaelen / Miyako

Miyako tells Kaelen her story: she was the best master of the shadow school — a Sun-Blade tradition emphasizing subtlety and invisibility. When she read the signs of an impending Dominion attack, she fled. Two weeks later, the Dominion destroyed the school, killing forty masters and a hundred students. She hid in Mirravale for two months, sabotaging Dominion operations as penance.

She reveals the glass house's interior: a machine of crystal and metal built by Dalrignon, containing mirror-portals and a central anchor — a crystallized human soul named Edren, a farmer from Thornholt. The fracture point where crystal meets metal cradle is the structural weakness. The building itself is a defense — mirror-surfaces redirect attacks.

Miyako begins teaching Kaelen the shadow-step technique, which bends light around mental stillness. Kaelen achieves two seconds of invisibility before his guilt over his dead unit shatters his concentration. Miyako commits to joining the alliance when the mission is complete.

**Key Events:** Miyako's backstory revealed, glass house interior described, shadow-step training begins, Kaelen achieves 2-second invisibility, Miyako pledges to join the alliance.

**Cliffhanger:** Kaelen and Miyako plan the assault on the glass house, knowing the odds of survival are slim.
