# Chapter 7 Summary — THE GLASS HOUSE

**POV:** Kaelen

Kaelen and Miyako infiltrate the glass house at midnight. Inside, they find a cathedral of nightmares — reflective walls showing delayed or distorted reflections, dozens of active mirror-portals, and the anchor at the center: a crystallized human face frozen in agony, eyes aware and desperate. The trapped soul is Edren, a farmer whose consciousness powers the entire portal network.

Dalrignon appears through a portal, having anticipated their arrival. He defends his work with cold intellectual detachment, calling Edren a "prototype sacrifice." The glass house responds to Dalrignon's will — he redirects their attacks through small portals. Kaelen attacks Dalrignon as a distraction while Miyako uses a ten-second shadow-step to reach the anchor undetected. Her obsidian knife strikes the fracture point.

The crystal cracks. The portals flicker. Dalrignon escapes through a personal portal. The anchor destabilizes and Kaelen and Miyako flee. The glass house explodes in a shockwave of mirror-light. Edren's soul is released — his expression transforms from agony to gratitude before dissolving into the stars. Every portal across the continent collapses simultaneously.

**Key Events:** Glass house infiltrated, anchor and Edren described, Dalrignon confronted, shadow-step used to strike the anchor, crystal cracked, Dalrignon escapes, glass house destroyed, all portals collapse, Edren's soul released.

**Cliffhanger:** Distant cheering from Aravalle confirms the portals are down — the siege has become a fair fight.
