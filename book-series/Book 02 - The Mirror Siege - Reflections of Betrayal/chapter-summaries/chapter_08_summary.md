# Chapter 8 Summary — THE PORTAL ENGINEER

**POV:** Dalrignon (Villain POV)

Dalrignon feels each of his twenty-six portals die as the anchor is destroyed. In his underground workshop beneath the Dominion's eastern fortress, he processes the loss with controlled fury and begins redesigning the system — six distributed anchors instead of one, eliminating the single point of failure.

Nightshade visits to demand a report for Volzentar. Dalrignon estimates seventeen months to rebuild, unless Volzentar diverts ash-oath reserves to accelerate crystal growth. Nightshade delivers a new assignment: review the ancient texts on the Great Gate — not the engineering specifications but the historical accounts of the original builders.

Dalrignon reads for three hours. The texts describe the Gate's connection to a dying dimension and an intelligence of incomprehensible scale. For the first time, his equations contain a variable he can't resolve. He writes two words on fresh vellum: BUILD FASTER.

**Key Events:** Portal collapse felt by Dalrignon, redesign begins with distributed anchor system, Nightshade visits, Great Gate assignment received, ancient texts reveal the scale of what's beyond the Gate.

**Cliffhanger:** Dalrignon reads the ancient builders' warnings and, instead of heeding them, accelerates his work.
