# Chapter 9 Summary — THE SIEGE OF ARAVALLE

**POV:** Itzil

Gravok's army arrives at dawn — twelve thousand infantry and eight hundred war-beasts. The siege of Aravalle begins with a massive assault on the western wall. Itzil fights on the walls as the Sun-Blade blazes, disrupting ash-oath sigils on contact. Rethane commands the wall defense with archers, boiling sand, and Torvane's ward-disruptors.

The gate buckles on the third war-beast impact. Itzil drops into the breach and holds it alone for eleven minutes, fighting with instinct and clarity until Rethane's reserves arrive. The mirror-portals flicker throughout the battle as Kaelen's mission takes effect. At three minutes past noon, all portals collapse simultaneously.

The Dominion army falters without reinforcements. Jagren's horn sounds from the south — the Sundrift garrison is marching. Itzil raises the Sun-Blade as a beacon and orders the gates opened for a counterattack.

**Key Events:** Siege begins, wall defense, gate breached, Itzil holds breach alone for 11 minutes, portals collapse, Jagren's reinforcements arrive, counterattack ordered.

**Cliffhanger:** Itzil leads the charge through the gates as the tide turns.
