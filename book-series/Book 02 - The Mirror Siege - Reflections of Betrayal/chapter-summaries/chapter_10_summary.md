# Chapter 10 Summary — THE ANCHOR FALLS

**POV:** Kaelen

Kaelen and Miyako flee the collapsing glass house as the cracked anchor destabilizes. Crystal panels fracture in cascade, mirror-portals collapse one by one, and the anchor screams with the release of compressed psychic agony. Miyako's obsidian tuning fork barely opens the wall for their escape.

They run down the hill as the anchor reaches critical instability. A column of silver-white light erupts from the glass house, then expands in a shockwave that dissolves the entire structure. In the flash, Kaelen sees Edren's face transform from agony to gratitude before dissolving into dust carried by the wind.

The hilltop is bare — nothing remains but scorched earth. A faint light rises from the center, pulsing like a heartbeat slowing to rest, then drifts upward into the stars. Distant cheering from Aravalle confirms the portals are down across the continent.

**Key Events:** Glass house collapses, anchor explodes, Edren's soul released and rises to the stars, all portals confirmed destroyed, Kaelen and Miyako survive.

**Cliffhanger:** The portals are down and the siege is now a fair fight — Kaelen and Miyako begin the journey back to allied territory.
