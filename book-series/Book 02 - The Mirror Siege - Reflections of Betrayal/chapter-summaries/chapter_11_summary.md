# Chapter 11 Summary — THE BEAST FALLS

**POV:** Itzil

Itzil leads the counterattack through the shattered gate of Aravalle. The Dominion army is reeling from the portal collapse — officers scrambling, war-beast handlers losing control. Jagren's cavalry arrives from Sundrift and hits the Dominion's exposed flank, shattering their left wing.

Itzil fights through the melee toward Gravok, breaking ash-oath sigils on war-beasts with the Sun-Blade's golden light. She reaches Gravok and engages in single combat. He is enormous and powerful, but she is faster and clearer. She dances around his attacks, wearing him down with precise strikes to armor gaps.

Gravok commits to an overhead killing blow. Itzil sidesteps, redirects his momentum, and pins him in a collapsed barricade with the Sun-Blade at his throat. She chooses mercy over killing — remembering Korvain's teaching that a captured enemy teaches everything. Gravok is chained. The Dominion army surrenders within the hour.

**Key Events:** Counterattack led by Itzil, Jagren's cavalry arrives, Itzil vs. Gravok single combat, Gravok defeated and captured alive, Dominion army surrenders.

**Cliffhanger:** Itzil spares Gravok — a decision that will interest Volzentar more than anything else she could have done.
