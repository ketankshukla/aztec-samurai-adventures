# Chapter 12 Summary — THE DUELIST'S GLORY

**POV:** Jagren

Jagren confronts Thornmaw, Gravok's elite beast-rider lieutenant, in single combat on the eastern edge of the battlefield. Thornmaw fights with a spiked chain and poisoned blade — weapons designed for patience and attrition. The beast-rider's war-beast adds a secondary threat.

The duel is the most intense combat Jagren has ever experienced. He uses Itzil's philosophy — waiting for the real opening, not the obvious one — to find the gap in Thornmaw's signature attack pattern. One decisive strike brings Thornmaw down. The watching soldiers cheer.

But the victory feels wrong. Standing over a bleeding opponent, Jagren doesn't feel the golden triumph he'd imagined since childhood. He feels heavy. He retreats behind a supply wagon, where Neyla finds him and bandages his wounds in silence. When he admits that winning should feel better, she responds: "That's how you know you're not a monster." Something fundamental shifts in Jagren.

**Key Events:** Jagren vs. Thornmaw duel, beast-rider defeated, crowd cheers, Jagren retreats from glory, Neyla's quiet wisdom changes him.

**Cliffhanger:** Jagren's understanding of glory is permanently altered — he's becoming a warrior instead of a performer.
