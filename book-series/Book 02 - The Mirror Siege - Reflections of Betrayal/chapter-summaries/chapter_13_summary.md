# Chapter 13 Summary — PRISONER OF WAR

**POV:** Itzil

Itzil personally interrogates Gravok in the Aravalle stockade. He reveals that the Dominion holds four of the seven relics needed to open the Great Gate. He describes the Weeping One — a demon-bound seer beneath the Dominion palace who knew his name, his history, and his future. She told him seven years ago that he would die in chains, talking to someone who treated him like a man instead of a weapon.

Gravok warns that Volzentar deployed the siege as both an attack and a test. Itzil's decision to spare Gravok has drawn Volzentar's personal interest — the next attack won't be an army but something she can't fight with a sword. Volzentar will target the people she loves.

**Key Events:** Gravok interrogated, four relics confirmed in Dominion hands, Weeping One described, Gravok's prophecy revealed, warning about Volzentar's personal interest.

**Cliffhanger:** Gravok warns that Volzentar gets personal — the next attack will target Itzil's team and vulnerabilities.
