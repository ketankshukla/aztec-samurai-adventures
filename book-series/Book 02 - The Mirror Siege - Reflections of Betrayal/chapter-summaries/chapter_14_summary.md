# Chapter 14 Summary — MIYAKO JOINS

**POV:** Kaelen

Kaelen arrives at the allied camp three days after the battle with Miyako at his side. He's greeted as a hero — the scout who destroyed the mirror-portals — but hates the attention. Miyako walks beside him unnoticed, her social camouflage instinctive after decades of hiding.

The team reunites: Itzil grips Kaelen's arm in relief, Jagren quips, Torvane assesses, Neyla prepares to heal. Kaelen introduces Miyako, who drops her invisibility for the first time and lets the full weight of who she is become visible. Itzil welcomes her to the alliance.

Miyako privately assesses the team and delivers a hard truth: they fight as individuals, not as a unit. Against the Dominion at full strength, this will get them killed. She offers to teach shadow-and-light coordinated combat techniques. Training begins the next day.

**Key Events:** Kaelen and Miyako arrive at camp, team reunites, Miyako introduced and welcomed, team assessment delivered, coordinated combat training proposed.

**Cliffhanger:** Kaelen and Itzil's unspoken connection deepens — she grips his arm and says "I'm starting to believe you" about his promise to come back.
