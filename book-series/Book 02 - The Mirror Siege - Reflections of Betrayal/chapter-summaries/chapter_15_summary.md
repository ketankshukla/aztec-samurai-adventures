# Chapter 15 Summary — TORVANE'S MACHINES

**POV:** Torvane

Torvane works in his workshop with salvaged mirror-portal fragments, building three devices: improved ward-disruptors (50-foot range), next-generation signal arrays using portal crystal resonance, and an enhanced portal detector. The fragments are beautiful engineering — and powered by human suffering.

The portal detector pings unexpectedly. The mirror-portals are destroyed, but the detector shows a faint, steady pulse at extreme range — a frequency older and deeper than Dalrignon's technology. Analysis reveals continuous operation over centuries.

Torvane brings the detector to Amalura, who recognizes the signal from the Sealed Archive's oldest scroll. It's the Great Gate's standby resonance — the signal it has emitted while sealed for a thousand years. Dalrignon didn't invent the portal technology; he reverse-engineered it from the Gate. The Gate is still operational and still emitting.

**Key Events:** Three devices built from salvage, portal detector detects ancient signal, Amalura identifies it as the Great Gate's standby resonance, revelation that Dalrignon's technology was reverse-engineered from the Gate.

**Cliffhanger:** The Gate is real, operational, and emitting a signal that suggests something ancient is still running beneath the Dominion capital.
