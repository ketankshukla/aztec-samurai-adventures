# Chapter 16 Summary — OLDER THAN THE DOMINION

**POV:** Itzil / Amalura

Itzil convenes the full team for a briefing where Amalura reveals the contents of the Sealed Archive. The Great Gate is an ancient portal connecting their world to the Realm Beyond the Veil — a dying dimension inhabited by a vast intelligence called the Hunger That Wears Stars. The original builders sealed the Gate after making contact because the intelligence consumed psychic energy — the consciousness of living beings.

The Dominion's mirror-portals were crude imitations reverse-engineered from the Gate's technology. The Dominion thinks they're using the Gate; the Gate is using them. The intelligence beyond has been guiding the empire for centuries, feeding technology through cracks in the seal.

Itzil establishes two priorities: deny the Dominion the remaining relics and build the alliance through diplomacy with neutral nations. She declares the Sun-Blade tradition's original purpose — not to fight wars but to guard a door.

**Key Events:** Sealed Archive revealed, Hunger That Wears Stars described, Gate's true nature explained, Dominion revealed as being guided by the intelligence, two-priority strategy established.

**Cliffhanger:** Itzil declares "It's been pushing. We push back" — accepting the Sun-Blade tradition's role as guardians of the Gate.
