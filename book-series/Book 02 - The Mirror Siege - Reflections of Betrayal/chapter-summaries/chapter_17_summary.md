# Chapter 17 Summary — NIGHTSHADE'S LAMENT

**POV:** Nightshade (Villain POV)

Nightshade walks through the Palace of the Split Crown to brief Volzentar on the siege's failure. Volzentar analyzes Itzil's decision to spare Gravok as evidence that she's "something he hasn't seen before." He orders Nightshade to study Itzil's team — find fracture lines, fears, guilts, the things they hide from each other.

Volzentar identifies Kaelen as the key: Itzil's most trusted person, the one she reaches for when afraid, and the one with the deepest fracture — eleven dead scouts and guilt so profound it shapes every decision. Nightshade is ordered to weaponize that guilt.

In her quarters, Nightshade reviews Kaelen's intelligence file and discovers a critical secret: the 7th Reconnaissance Unit was destroyed by an ambush based on compromised patrol routes. Someone inside the allied command structure betrayed Kaelen's unit. A traitor. No one has told Kaelen.

Nightshade's background is revealed: born in a border town, father resisted and died, mother collaborated and rose. She chose the space between resistance and collaboration. She understands people architecturally — sees their load-bearing beliefs and stress fractures.

**Key Events:** Volzentar orders phase two targeting Itzil's team, Kaelen identified as key target, Nightshade discovers the 7th Unit was betrayed by a traitor, Nightshade's backstory revealed.

**Cliffhanger:** Nightshade has found the weapon to fracture Kaelen — the secret that his unit was betrayed, not just ambushed.
