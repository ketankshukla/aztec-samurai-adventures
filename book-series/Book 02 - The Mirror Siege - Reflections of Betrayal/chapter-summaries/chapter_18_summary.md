# Chapter 18 Summary — THE INTERROGATION

**POV:** Itzil / Amalura

Itzil and Amalura conduct a second interrogation of Gravok, focused on the Weeping One and the Great Gate. Gravok describes the deep levels beneath the Dominion palace — ancient corridors cut by inhuman tools, darkness that behaves like a substance, and the constant sound of weeping.

The Weeping One (Serenthar) knew Gravok's name, his history, every person he'd killed, and his future — all told seven years before the events occurred. She predicted Itzil would spare him and that the Gate would open. She described what's on the other side: a hunger for consciousness itself that would eat people from the inside out, leaving shells going through the motions of life.

Gravok reveals the Weeping One's cryptic prophecy: "the one who forges the blade a second time" would unmake everything Volzentar built. Amalura connects this to a future reforging of the Sun-Blade. A captured Dominion officer in a separate cell repeats a message in a trance: "The Weeping One already knows you'll fail."

**Key Events:** Second interrogation of Gravok, Weeping One described in detail, prophecy about the blade-forger revealed, Dominion officer used as remote communication vessel.

**Cliffhanger:** The Weeping One is watching them — she's known their plans since before they made them, delivered through a human vessel as a chilling message.
