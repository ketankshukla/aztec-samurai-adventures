# Chapter 20 Summary — NEYLA'S DISCOVERY

**POV:** Neyla

Neyla treats ash-oathed prisoners in the stockade every morning, driven by the knowledge that her own family was ash-oathed four years ago. While performing a healing assessment on Corporal Tessen — a farmer's son from Millbrook — her turquoise healing magic interacts with the crimson ash-oath sigil. The sigil flickers and suppresses for two seconds. Tessen's eyes clear and he whispers "Help" before the oath reasserts itself.

Neyla experiments methodically for three hours. Her healing magic can consistently suppress ash-oath sigils for up to two seconds, creating momentary windows of consciousness in the enslaved soldiers. She can't break the oaths — the sigils are too strong — but she's found the shape of the key.

She reports to Itzil and Kaelen. The strategic implications are staggering: if ash-oaths can be broken, half the Dominion's fighting force would regain their will. Itzil authorizes continued research with full access to prisoners, Amalura's texts, and whatever time Neyla needs.

**Key Events:** Neyla discovers her healing magic can suppress ash-oath sigils, Tessen briefly regains consciousness, two-second suppression window confirmed, Itzil authorizes full research program.

**Cliffhanger:** Neyla has found the first crack in the Dominion's most terrible weapon — now she needs to turn a crack into a door.
