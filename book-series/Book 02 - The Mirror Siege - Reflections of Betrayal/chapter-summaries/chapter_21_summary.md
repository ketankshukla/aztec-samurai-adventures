# Chapter 21 Summary — WAR COUNCIL

**POV:** Itzil

Itzil convenes a full war council in Aravalle's great hall, presenting everything the alliance has learned: mirror-portals, the Great Gate, the Hunger That Wears Stars, the Weeping One, four relics in Dominion hands. The commanders absorb the revelation that the Dominion is being guided by an extradimensional intelligence.

Itzil establishes two strategic priorities: deny the Dominion the remaining relics and build the alliance through diplomacy with neutral nations. She announces plans to send a diplomatic envoy led by Zariel — a diplomat-spymaster recommended by Korvain — to the neutral courts.

After the council, Kaelen tells Itzil that the commanders followed her — not just the plan, but her personally. When she deflects, saying they follow the blade, he responds: "Someone worth following." The three words settle in her chest, and that night she allows herself to feel hope for the first time since the war began.

**Key Events:** Full war council briefed on Gate threat, two-priority strategy presented, Zariel diplomatic mission announced, Kaelen's three-word affirmation.

**Cliffhanger:** Itzil feels hope for the first time — planted by three words from the person she trusts most.
