# Chapter 22 Summary — DALRIGNON'S RAGE

**POV:** Dalrignon (Villain POV)

Dalrignon works obsessively in his underground workshop, designing a filter mechanism for the Great Gate. His mirror-portal technology was a stepping stone — the Gate is his true ambition. Volzentar has ordered the Gate opened in eighteen months.

Dalrignon's backstory is revealed: a clockmaker's son who built a dimensional folding device at fourteen, acquired by the Dominion at seventeen. He's adapted to the human cost of his work through compartmentalization — the first soul extraction made him vomit for an hour; by the fifth, he stopped entirely.

The Gate filter is his most ambitious project: a mechanism to regulate the flow of energy and matter between dimensions, allowing controlled access to the Realm Beyond the Veil's power without opening the floodgates. The probability of filter failure is 2.7 percent — low enough to proceed, high enough to end the world.

He reads the ancient builders' texts about the intelligence beyond the Gate. For the first time, his equations contain variables that exceed his models. His response: BUILD FASTER. Beneath the fortress, the ancient technology hums, and beyond the dimensional barrier, the Hunger intensifies by one imperceptible degree.

**Key Events:** Gate filter designed, 2.7% failure probability calculated, eighteen-month timeline established, Dalrignon's backstory revealed, ancient builders' warnings dismissed.

**Cliffhanger:** The intelligence beyond the Gate feels the seal beginning to give way — and its hunger intensifies.
