# Chapter 23 Summary — THE WEEPING ONE

**POV:** Volzentar / Serenthar (Villain POV)

Volzentar descends alone into the deepest chamber beneath the Palace of the Split Crown to consult Serenthar, the Weeping One — a demon-bound seer who perceives all timelines simultaneously. The descent is described in visceral detail: darkness that behaves like a substance, cold that drops in discrete strata, and constant, automated weeping.

Serenthar tells Volzentar that Itzil will escape every trap he sets. She will break but put herself back together — "she breaks clean." Nightshade's plan to weaponize Kaelen's guilt will work in most timelines but not all. In some, the truth makes Kaelen stronger.

Serenthar delivers the book's most critical prophecy: the one Volzentar should fear is not Itzil but "the one who forges the blade a second time" — a craftsman hidden by insignificance in a village no one has heard of. She confirms the Gate will open because Volzentar's mechanisms are already in motion and cannot be reversed. Dalrignon's filter will not work as intended.

The intelligence beyond the Gate has been guiding Volzentar since before he was born. The odds favor the Hunger — but they are not zero. And not-zero, Serenthar knows, is the only number that matters.

**Key Events:** Volzentar visits Serenthar, multiple prophecies delivered, Nightshade's plan assessed across timelines, blade-forger prophecy expanded, Gate confirmed to open, filter confirmed to fail.

**Cliffhanger:** Serenthar weeps because the ending is always the same — but the variable of six people and a blade of golden light keeps the odds at not-zero.
