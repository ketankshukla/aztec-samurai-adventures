Chapter 1 - THE ARMY ON THE MOVE

The war table was a slab of limestone the size of a door, and every inch of it was covered in bad news.

Itzil stood at its head, palms flat against the cool stone, staring at the collection of carved markers that represented the allied forces. There were not enough of them. There had never been enough of them, but the gap between what they had and what they needed had been an abstraction before — a number in Amalura's reports, a concern for tomorrow. Tomorrow had arrived three days early and brought company.

"Gravok's main force crossed the Ember River at dawn." Kaelen's voice was flat, professional, stripped of the sardonic edge he usually carried like a blade. He stood across the table with his scout's map unrolled over the limestone, charcoal marks still fresh. "Twelve thousand infantry. Eight hundred war-beasts. Supply train stretching two miles. He's moving fast — faster than an army that size should be able to move."

"How fast?" Itzil asked.

"Three days. Maybe less if he pushes through the night. He's burning villages for fuel as he goes. Doesn't need to forage when everything behind you is on fire."

Commander Rethane of the Aravalle garrison — a broad woman with iron-grey hair cropped close to her skull — leaned over the map and traced the route with a scarred finger. "If he crosses the Thornfield basin, he has a clear run at three cities. Aravalle, Sundrift, and Ironpool. All within a day's march of each other."

"He'll hit all three," Kaelen said.

Rethane shook her head. "He can't. Not simultaneously. He'd have to split his forces three ways, and even twelve thousand doesn't divide evenly against fortified cities."

Kaelen didn't answer. He looked at Itzil, and she saw something in his pale grey-blue eyes that she'd learned to recognize over the past weeks: he knew something he hadn't said yet. Something that would change the shape of the conversation.

"What aren't you telling us?" she asked.

"Nothing confirmed. Rumors from the forward scouts. Things that don't add up." He ran a hand through his dark hair — a nervous habit she'd noticed he only showed when the stakes were personal. "The numbers are wrong, Itzil. Gravok has twelve thousand soldiers but he's been making promises to the occupied towns that suggest he's planning to hit all three cities at once, with full force at each location. That's thirty-six thousand soldiers he doesn't have."

"Then he's bluffing," Rethane said.

"Gravok doesn't bluff. He doesn't need to. He's a hammer, not a diplomat." Kaelen tapped the map. "He has something. A force multiplier. I don't know what it is yet, but I know the math doesn't work without one."

The tent fell silent. Outside, the sounds of the allied camp filtered through the canvas — the clank of armor being repaired, the low murmur of soldiers eating their evening meal, the distant whinny of horses. Six weeks ago, this camp hadn't existed. Six weeks ago, Itzil had been a temple warrior with a team of four and a weapon she barely understood. Now she commanded — or something like it — an alliance of city garrisons, volunteer militia, and the remnants of a Sun-Blade tradition that had nearly died.

She didn't feel like a commander. She felt like a woman standing in a room full of people who expected her to have answers she didn't possess.

"Korvain sent a message this morning," she said. The room stiffened. Korvain's messages were rare and never comforting. "He says Gravok will hit all three cities. He says we don't have the numbers to defend all three. He says we should choose which two to save."

The silence that followed was the heavy kind. The kind that pressed against the walls and made the air thick.

"Which two?" Rethane asked.

Itzil looked at the map. Three cities. Three clusters of civilian population. Three sets of walls and gates and market squares and homes where children slept and old women hung laundry and bakers rose before dawn to light their ovens. Each city held between eight and fifteen thousand people. Choosing two meant abandoning one. Abandoning one meant condemning thousands to Dominion occupation — to ash-oaths, to slavery, to the erasure of everything they were.

She thought of Solquetal. Her village. The smoke and the screaming and the empty eyes of the ash-oathed villager standing in the square with a sword he didn't know he was holding. She thought of how that feeling — the helpless fury of watching people be unmade — had become the thing that drove her out of bed every morning and kept her standing at this table when every rational part of her mind said she wasn't qualified to be here.

"We defend all three," she said.

Rethane's expression didn't change, which was worse than if she'd argued. It was the expression of a professional soldier listening to an amateur make a mistake. "Commander, with respect — we don't have the forces to hold three fronts. If Gravok concentrates on any one city, we'll break."

"Then we make sure he can't concentrate." Itzil straightened. The Sun-Blade hummed at her hip — a warmth she'd learned to feel even through the leather of the scabbard. It didn't manifest unless she called it, but it was always there, patient and heavy and waiting. "Aravalle is the largest city and the most defensible. It gets our main force — Rethane, that's you. I'll be with you on the front line."

She moved markers on the map. "Sundrift gets Jagren and a defensive garrison. He's the best fighter we have in close quarters. If Gravok hits Sundrift, Jagren holds the walls while we march from Aravalle."

"That's a six-hour march," Rethane said.

"Then Jagren holds for six hours. He'll like it. He's been complaining about boredom."

Rethane almost smiled. Almost.

"Ironpool." Itzil placed the last marker. A single piece of carved obsidian, small and alone. "Skeleton crew. Torvane's signal arrays and Neyla's field hospital. They're the least likely target — smallest city, fewest resources."

"And if Gravok does hit Ironpool first?"

Itzil looked at Kaelen. He met her gaze and held it. She could see him already calculating — distances, sight lines, escape routes. His mind never stopped running terrain.

"Kaelen goes behind enemy lines," she said. "Before the attack. He finds out what Gravok's force multiplier is, and he destroys it. If we take away Gravok's advantage, this becomes a fair fight. And in a fair fight, we can hold all three."

Kaelen nodded. Once. Sharp. No hesitation, no complaint, no argument. She'd expected argument. She'd prepared for it.

"You're wounded," she said. It came out before she could stop it — softer than she'd intended, more personal than a commander should sound in a tent full of officers.

Kaelen's expression didn't change. The claw marks down his back from his last encounter with Gravok's war-beast were barely a week old. She'd seen Neyla changing his bandages — four parallel lines of angry red tissue running from his left shoulder blade to his right hip, deep enough to have nicked bone. He moved like a man carrying glass.

"I'm the only one who can do this and we both know it," he said. His voice was neutral. Professional. The same tone he used when reporting scout positions or weather patterns. "I'm the fastest. I know the terrain. I've been in Gravok's camp before."

"If you die out there—"

"Then you'll find someone else who can't count." The faintest ghost of a smile crossed his face. It didn't reach his eyes.

Itzil didn't laugh. Neither did anyone else.

She held his gaze for a moment longer than necessary. Then she turned back to the map.

"We move at first light. Rethane, begin the Aravalle fortification. Jagren marches for Sundrift tonight — I'll brief him personally. Torvane starts installing signal mirrors between all three cities. If any position comes under attack, the others know within minutes."

The officers filed out. Kaelen was the last to leave. At the tent flap, he paused.

"Itzil."

She looked up.

"You made the right call. Defending all three." He held the tent flap open. The sunset beyond was the color of old blood. "Korvain would have chosen two. That's why you're not Korvain."

He left. The tent was empty. Itzil stood alone at the war table, looking at three small markers on a map that represented everything she was trying to protect, and felt the weight of command settle across her shoulders like a yoke.

She pressed her palms against the stone until her knuckles whitened.

"Don't you dare let them die," she whispered. She wasn't talking to anyone in the room. She wasn't sure who she was talking to.

The Sun-Blade pulsed once. Warm. Steady. Patient.

She picked up her sword and walked out to brief Jagren.
