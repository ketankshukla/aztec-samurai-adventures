Chapter 2 - MIRRORS AND SMOKE

Kaelen crossed the Ember River at the place where the water ran shallow over flat stones, moving in the grey hour before dawn when the world was colorless and sounds carried too far. The river was cold — snowmelt from the northern peaks — and it bit into his legs like teeth as he waded across, holding his pack above his head with arms that shook from the chill and the protest of healing wounds.

The claw marks on his back pulled with every step. Neyla had done her best — the tissue was closed, the infection beaten back, the worst of the nerve damage soothed by whatever it was her magic did that no one, including Neyla, fully understood. But the scars were tight and new, and the muscles beneath them remembered being torn apart. Every stretch was a reminder. Every twist sent a hot wire of pain from shoulder to hip.

He reached the far bank and crouched in the reeds, dripping, listening. The Dominion side of the river was different. He'd noticed it on his last crossing, but it hit harder now. The silence. Not the natural silence of open country — the heavy, pressed silence of land that had been emptied. No birdsong. No insects. No wind in the grain, because there was no grain. The fields on this side had been burned to stubble, the farmhouses reduced to stone foundations and ash, the trees along the road cut for siege timber. The Dominion didn't occupy territory. It consumed it.

He dressed quickly, pulling on the rough-spun trader's clothes he'd packed. His scout gear went into the oilskin bag: the dark leather, the throwing knives, the flex-soled boots that let him feel the ground through his feet. He kept one knife — a short blade strapped to his inner forearm, hidden beneath the loose sleeve. He kept his eyes and his training. Those were harder to hide but impossible to leave behind.

The road north was empty. Or rather, the road north was full of emptiness — the kind that pressed against the skin and made the hair stand up on the back of his neck. He'd walked through Dominion territory before. It never got easier. The ash-oath sigils on the doors of abandoned houses. The occasional figure standing motionless in a field — an ash-oathed slave, body functional, mind erased, waiting for orders that might never come. They didn't look at him as he passed. They didn't look at anything.

He walked for six hours. The landscape changed as he moved deeper into occupied territory — from burned farmland to a kind of grim order. Roads repaired. Supply depots established. Watchtowers at regular intervals, manned by Dominion soldiers in black and silver who watched the road with the bored alertness of an empire that expected no resistance.

Kaelen avoided the watchtowers. He knew their sight lines — he'd mapped them on his first infiltration, storing the angles and distances in the part of his mind that never forgot terrain. He moved through the gaps, threading between patrol patterns with the fluid instinct of a man who had spent his entire adult life being where he wasn't supposed to be.

By midday he reached the forward camp.

He smelled it before he saw it — the thick, animal stink of war-beasts mixing with the sharp tang of forge smoke and the underlying sweetness of too many bodies in too small a space. The camp sprawled across a valley that had once been farmland, a city of canvas and timber and black banners that stretched nearly a mile in every direction. Twelve thousand soldiers. Eight hundred war-beasts in their pens, bellowing and snapping at handlers who moved with the careful speed of people who knew that a moment's inattention meant losing a hand.

Kaelen climbed a ridge overlooking the camp and settled into a hollow between two boulders, pulling dried grass over his body until he was nothing but another shadow on the hillside. He uncapped the small telescope Torvane had built for him — brass and crystal, compact enough to fit in a palm — and began to observe.

The camp was organized with military precision. Barracks tents in rows. Officers' quarters at the center, distinguished by their size and the silver pennants flying above them. A training ground where soldiers drilled in formations that Kaelen recognized from a dozen battlefields. Supply wagons being loaded and unloaded. Smiths hammering. Quartermasters counting.

All of this was expected. All of this was normal.

What was not normal was the light.

At the eastern edge of the camp, set apart from the main body by a perimeter of guards, a cluster of structures glowed. Not with firelight or torchlight — with something else. Something that shifted and rippled like water standing on edge. Kaelen adjusted the telescope and felt his stomach drop.

Mirror-portals.

He'd read Amalura's notes on the old texts. He'd heard the intelligence reports from captured Dominion scouts. But reading about them and seeing them were different in the way that reading about drowning and having water close over your head were different.

They hung in the air like vertical pools of mercury — shimmering, reflective surfaces the size of doorways, each framed by a structure of dark crystal and metal that hummed with a low, subsonic vibration he could feel in his teeth. Through each portal, he could see — not the camp, not the valley, but somewhere else entirely. A city street. A mountain pass. A stretch of coastline. Each portal was a window to a different location, and as he watched, soldiers walked through them. A squad of six entered one portal and vanished. Through the telescope, he could see the same six soldiers stepping out of thin air on the other side — wherever the other side was.

He counted the portals. Six. Ten. Fourteen. Twenty-two. Twenty-six.

Twenty-six portals. Each capable of moving a squad in seconds. That was the force multiplier. Gravok didn't need thirty-six thousand soldiers. He needed twelve thousand soldiers who could be anywhere on the continent in the time it took to walk through a door.

Kaelen's mind ran the tactical math with the cold, automatic precision of a scout who had been calculating threat assessments since he was sixteen. Twenty-six portals. Average transit time of ten seconds per squad. Squads of six. That meant Gravok could relocate his entire army — all twelve thousand — in under two hours. He could hit Aravalle at dawn, pull his forces through the portals, and hit Sundrift by noon. He could feint at one city, draw the defense, then teleport his main force to the weakest point.

It was elegant. It was devastating. It was the end of conventional defense.

Kaelen watched for another hour. He mapped the portal positions, the guard rotations, the power structures he could identify. He noted that the portals seemed to pulse in a rhythm — brightening and dimming in sync, as though they were all connected to the same source. A heartbeat. A single heart, pumping mirror-light through twenty-six veins.

He needed to find that heart.

The sun was beginning to set when he started his withdrawal. Slowly. Carefully. Easing out of his hide site one inch at a time, moving with the patience of a man who understood that speed killed scouts faster than any blade. The grass rustled as he moved, but the wind was blowing from the camp toward him, carrying sound away.

He was fifty yards from the ridgeline when the shadow fell.

It dropped across the ground in front of him like a blanket — too large to be a man, too solid to be a cloud. The stench hit him next. Rotting meat and iron and the musky, animal reek of something that ate other animals for pleasure.

Kaelen froze.

The war-beast landed on the ridge behind him with a sound like a building settling. It was enormous — fifteen feet at the shoulder, a creature of muscle and bone and armored hide, with a head like a battering ram and eyes that glowed with the dull crimson of ash-oath magic. Its claws had gouged furrows in the stone where it perched.

And on its back, sitting with the casual ease of a man in a favorite chair, was the largest human being Kaelen had ever seen.

Gravok was a mountain given flesh. Seven feet tall, shoulders wide enough to fill a doorway, arms like the trunks of young trees. His armor was black iron and beast-bone, the plates decorated with the teeth and claws of things he'd killed. His hair was braided tight against his skull, woven with the fangs of predators. His face was a map of violence — scarred, broad, dominated by a jaw that could have been carved from granite.

He was grinning.

"A scout," Gravok said. His voice was deep enough to feel in the chest. "This close to my camp." He leaned forward on the beast's neck, studying Kaelen the way a man studies an insect before deciding whether to crush it. "Either you're very good or you're very stupid."

Kaelen's mind was already running. Distance to the nearest cover: forty yards of open ground. The beast could close that in two leaps. Gravok's reach with his weapon — a massive double-headed axe strapped to the beast's saddle — extended his threat radius another six feet. Fighting was not an option. Gravok could break him in half without breathing hard.

"Little of both," Kaelen said.

He moved.

Not toward cover — that was the obvious play and Gravok would expect it. Instead, Kaelen threw himself forward, under the war-beast's head, rolling between its legs as the creature lunged. The beast's jaws snapped shut on empty air. Its massive body pivoted, but Kaelen was already through — behind the beast, sprinting low across the broken ground.

The beast's tail swept the ground. He jumped it. Barely. His landing sent a spike of pain through his back — the claw marks screaming — and he stumbled. The beast was turning. Gravok was laughing.

Kaelen pulled a flash-powder charge from his belt — one of Torvane's inventions, a paper twist packed with magnesium and sulfur — and hurled it at the beast's face. The charge detonated in a burst of white light and acrid smoke. The beast shrieked, rearing back, pawing at its eyes. Gravok cursed and hauled on the reins.

Kaelen ran. Through the thorn thicket, ignoring the barbs that tore at his clothes and skin. Down the slope, feet sliding on loose scree. Through the stream at the valley floor, water splashing, cold, the rocks treacherous beneath his boots. The claw marks on his back had reopened — he could feel the warmth of blood soaking through his shirt, the familiar sick pulse of damaged tissue being pushed past its limits.

Behind him, Gravok's voice carried across the distance, still laughing: "I like fast prey. Makes the hunt better."

Kaelen ran until the laughter faded. Until the only sounds were his own breathing and the thud of his heartbeat in his ears. Until the Dominion camp was a dark smear on the horizon and the allied territory was close enough to taste.

He staggered into the forward outpost at dusk. The sentries recognized him and lowered their spears. A runner was sent. He didn't wait. He walked — staggered, really, his legs giving way every few steps — toward the command tent.

Itzil was there. Of course she was. She was always at the command tent, as if she could hold the war together by standing close enough to the map. She looked up when he came in, and her face went through three expressions in rapid succession: relief, then fear, then the carefully controlled mask she wore when she didn't want anyone to see what she was feeling.

"Kaelen."

He leaned against the tent pole. Blood was running down his back, pooling in his waistband. His hands were shaking. His vision had a grey, contracting quality that meant he was running out of time before his body made its own decisions about consciousness.

He said two words.

"Mirror portals."

Then the grey closed in and the ground came up to meet him.
