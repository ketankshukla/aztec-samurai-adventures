Chapter 3 - THE BEAST COMMANDER

The world came back in pieces.

First: pain. The deep, structural kind that lived in bone and muscle and announced itself with every heartbeat like a drum struck too hard. Kaelen's back was a landscape of fire — the reopened claw marks pulsing with a wet, insistent agony that made his teeth clench and his fingers dig into whatever surface was beneath him.

Second: light. Warm, golden, moving. Not sunlight — too focused, too intentional. Healing light. Neyla's light.

He opened his eyes. The ceiling of the medical tent swam into focus above him — canvas stretched over wooden poles, stained with watermarks and the shadows of people moving outside. He was lying face-down on a cot, his shirt removed, his back exposed to the air and to Neyla's hands, which hovered an inch above the claw marks and radiated a turquoise-gold warmth that sank into his flesh like water into parched earth.

"Don't move," Neyla said. Her voice had the calm, firm quality of someone who said those two words fifty times a day and meant them every time. "The tissue is closing but it's fragile. If you tear it again, I can't promise it'll heal clean."

"How long was I out?"

"Six hours. You collapsed in the command tent. Itzil caught you before you hit the table." A pause. "She hasn't left the tent flap since they brought you here. She's pretending to review reports but she's checked on you eleven times. I counted."

Kaelen said nothing. He filed the information in the same place he filed everything about Itzil — a growing collection of observations that he didn't examine too closely because examining them would require acknowledging what they meant, and acknowledging what they meant would require him to be a different kind of person than the one he'd spent years becoming.

"The mirror portals," he said instead. "Did I—"

"You said two words and passed out. Itzil filled in the gaps from what you'd told her before. The war council has been in session for four hours." Neyla's hands shifted, and a wave of warmth rolled down his spine. The pain receded — not gone, but muffled, like a scream heard through thick walls. "Twenty-six portals. Instant troop movement. Gravok can hit all three cities with his full force."

"Did they believe it?"

"Rethane did. She's already redesigning the defense. Torvane's building something — he hasn't slept. He's been muttering about signal mirrors and frequency resonance and other things I don't understand." Another pause. "Jagren already marched for Sundrift. He left an hour after you came in. He said to tell you — and I'm quoting — 'Next time, try not to get mauled by the same beast twice. It's embarrassing for the rest of us.'"

Despite everything, Kaelen almost smiled. Almost.

Neyla worked in silence for several minutes. The healing warmth was doing its job — he could feel the torn edges of muscle knitting together, the damaged skin tightening as new tissue formed beneath her magic. It wasn't painless. Healing never was. The body remembered its injuries even as it was being repaired, and the memory was its own kind of suffering.

"You shouldn't have gone back out there," Neyla said quietly. "Your body wasn't ready."

"My body is rarely consulted on these decisions."

"That's not funny, Kaelen."

"It wasn't meant to be."

She lifted her hands. The warmth faded. "You can sit up. Slowly."

He sat up slowly. The tent tilted, steadied, and settled into its proper orientation. His back ached — a deep, bone-level throb — but the sharp, tearing pain was gone. He looked down at his hands. Clean. Someone had washed the blood off while he slept.

"Neyla."

She was organizing her supplies — bandages, salves, the small crystal vials of concentrated healing energy she'd learned to create. She looked up.

"Thank you."

She nodded. "Go talk to Itzil. She needs to hear the details from you, not from a secondhand summary delivered while she's pretending not to worry."

He found Itzil outside the command tent, exactly where Neyla had said she'd be. She was sitting on an ammunition crate with a stack of reports on her lap, but the reports were upside down and her eyes were on the medical tent's entrance. When she saw him, her face did the thing it always did — the flash of something unguarded, quickly controlled, replaced by the careful neutrality of command.

"You look terrible," she said.

"You should see the other guy."

"I've seen him. He weighs three hundred pounds and rides a monster. You weigh a hundred and sixty and you're held together with bandages and stubbornness." She stood, and the reports scattered from her lap. She didn't pick them up. "Tell me everything."

He told her everything. The camp layout. The portal positions. The guard rotations. The pulsing rhythm that connected all twenty-six portals like veins to a heart. She listened with the focused intensity she brought to everything — not just hearing the words but building the tactical picture in her mind, fitting each piece into the larger map.

"They're connected," she said when he finished. "All the portals. To a single source."

"That's what it looked like. A central anchor. Something that powers the entire network."

"If we destroy the anchor—"

"Every portal goes down simultaneously. No more force multiplication. Gravok's army stays wherever it is when the portals collapse."

Itzil's eyes sharpened. He recognized the expression — it was the one she wore when a plan was forming, when the pieces of a puzzle were clicking into place behind her eyes. "You want to go back."

It wasn't a question. She knew him well enough now to read the shape of what he was going to say before he said it. He found that both comforting and unsettling.

"I need to find the anchor. It wasn't in the main camp — I would have seen it. It's somewhere else. Somewhere connected to the portals but separate from Gravok's forces. Protected." He met her gaze. "I need to go deeper into Dominion territory than I've ever been. Past the forward camp. Into the occupied towns."

"Alone."

"I move faster alone. And a group would be spotted. One person, dressed as a trader, asking careful questions — that's invisible. A team of soldiers is a target."

Itzil was quiet for a long moment. The camp sounds filled the silence between them — hammers, voices, the creak of wagon wheels. The setting sun painted the western sky in shades of amber and rust.

"You're still wounded," she said.

"I'm always wounded. It's a professional hazard."

"This isn't a joke, Kaelen."

"No." He dropped the sardonic tone. It was a shield and they both knew it. "It isn't. But the math is the same whether I'm joking or not. Twenty-six portals. Twelve thousand soldiers who can be anywhere in hours. If we don't take out the anchor before Gravok attacks, it doesn't matter how well we defend. He'll overwhelm us through sheer mobility."

"And if you die out there, I lose my best scout and the only person who's seen the portals firsthand."

"Then you'll have to train someone else to be insufferable. I'm sure Jagren would volunteer."

She didn't laugh. He hadn't expected her to. The weight of the conversation was pressing down on both of them — the acknowledgment, unspoken but clear, that what he was proposing was a mission with a low probability of return.

Itzil stepped closer. Close enough that he could see the flecks of gold in her dark eyes, the tension in her jaw, the way her fingers were wrapped around the pommel of the Sun-Blade so tightly that the leather creaked.

"Come back," she said. Two words. Simple. Loaded with everything neither of them was willing to name.

"I always do."

"You've done this twice. Twice isn't always."

"Third time's the charm."

She held his gaze. He held hers. The moment stretched — taut, fragile, filled with the things they weren't saying. Then she stepped back and the mask of command settled over her features like armor.

"Take three days of supplies. Torvane has a new detection device — something that can sense mirror-portal energy. He'll brief you before you leave. Report by signal mirror every twelve hours. If you miss two consecutive reports, I'm sending a team after you."

"That would compromise—"

"I'm sending a team after you. That's not negotiable."

He looked at her. She looked at him. Something passed between them that was older than words and more honest than anything either of them could have said.

"Yes, Commander," he said.

He turned and walked toward the quartermaster's tent. Behind him, he heard Itzil pick up her scattered reports. He didn't look back. Looking back was a luxury scouts couldn't afford.

The sun set. The camp settled into the restless quiet of a military force waiting for a war to begin. Kaelen packed his gear, checked his weapons, and slipped out through the northern perimeter in the last grey light of dusk.

The Dominion territory waited, dark and silent and vast.

He walked into it alone.
