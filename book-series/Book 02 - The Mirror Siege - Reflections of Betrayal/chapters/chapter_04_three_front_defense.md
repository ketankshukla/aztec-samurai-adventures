Chapter 4 - THREE-FRONT DEFENSE

The war council convened at dawn in a room that smelled of cold stone and fear.

Itzil stood at the head of the limestone table — the same table, the same tent, but everything else had changed. The markers on the map had been rearranged. New ones had been added, painted red to represent the mirror-portals Kaelen had described. Twenty-six red markers clustered at the eastern edge of the map like drops of blood.

Commander Rethane stood to her left, arms folded, face carved from the same granite as the city walls she'd defended for twenty years. To her right, Torvane hunched over a device of brass and crystal that looked like a compass mated with a music box — his portal detector, assembled from salvaged components and three sleepless nights of obsessive engineering. Behind them, the allied commanders filled the tent: garrison captains, militia leaders, the handful of professional soldiers who'd answered the call when the Sun-Blade bearer asked for help.

They were not enough. They had never been enough. But they were here, and that counted for something.

"Kaelen's intelligence changes our entire defensive picture," Itzil began. No preamble. No speeches. She'd learned that commanders who talked too long before getting to the point lost their audience before the point arrived. "Gravok has twenty-six mirror-portals. Each one can transport a squad of soldiers instantly. He doesn't need to split his forces to hit three cities — he can concentrate everything on one target, then relocate in hours."

She let that sink in. The faces around the table shifted — from attention to alarm to the particular kind of focused dread that came when professional soldiers recognized a problem they couldn't solve with the tools they had.

"The good news," she continued, "is that the portals are connected. They all pulse in sync — same rhythm, same energy signature. That means they're powered by a single source. A central anchor. Kaelen is behind enemy lines right now, looking for it. When he finds it, he'll destroy it. When the anchor falls, every portal collapses simultaneously."

"When," Rethane said. Not "if." It was a gift — the old commander extending trust she hadn't fully earned. Itzil took it.

"When. But we don't know how long it'll take. Could be a day. Could be a week. In the meantime, we need to hold all three cities against an enemy that can teleport."

She turned to Torvane. He straightened — or tried to. Three days without sleep had given him the look of a man assembled from spare parts. His spectacles were smudged, his hair stood at angles that defied gravity, and his fingers were stained with solder and ink. But his eyes were sharp. Torvane's eyes were always sharp.

"Signal mirrors," he said. His voice was soft but precise — the voice of a man who'd spent his life explaining complex things to people who didn't want to understand them. "I've built relay stations between all three cities. Polished steel on elevated platforms, angled to catch sunlight. Each station can flash a coded message to the next in under thirty seconds. Full communication between Aravalle, Sundrift, and Ironpool in under two minutes."

"At night?" Rethane asked.

"Lantern arrays. Slower — four minutes for a full message — but functional. We won't be blind after dark."

Itzil nodded. "The strategy is simple. We can't match Gravok's mobility, so we don't try. Instead, we make each city strong enough to hold independently for six hours — the time it takes for reinforcements to march from the nearest allied city."

She moved markers on the map as she spoke. "Aravalle gets the main force. Five thousand troops, our best walls, and me. If Gravok hits us first — which he probably will, because we're the biggest threat — we hold the walls and signal the other cities to send reinforcements."

"Sundrift." She placed Jagren's marker. "Twenty-five hundred troops under Jagren. He's already there, fortifying the western approach. Sundrift's walls are thinner but the terrain favors defense — narrow valley, high ground on both sides. Jagren can hold the chokepoint."

"Ironpool." The last marker. "One thousand troops. Torvane's detection equipment and Neyla's field hospital. Ironpool is the smallest target and the least likely first strike. But if it comes under attack, Torvane's signal arrays give us warning, and we march."

Rethane studied the map. "Six hours is a long time to hold against twelve thousand soldiers with portal support."

"It is. Which is why the first city to be attacked doesn't just defend — it delays. Barricades in the streets. Traps at the gates. Make Gravok fight for every block. The longer we hold, the more time Kaelen has to find the anchor, and the more time the reinforcement columns have to arrive."

She looked around the table. The faces were grim but steady. These were people who understood that the plan wasn't perfect — couldn't be perfect, not against an enemy with this kind of advantage. The plan was a structure built to buy time, and time was all they had to spend.

"Questions," she said.

A militia captain — young, nervous, commanding a force of three hundred farmers with spears — raised his hand. "What happens if Gravok hits all three cities at once? Through the portals?"

"He won't. The portals give him mobility, not multiplication. He still only has twelve thousand soldiers. If he splits them three ways, each city faces four thousand — and four thousand against fortified walls is a losing proposition, even for Gravok. He'll concentrate. Hit one city with everything. That's his strength and his weakness."

"How do we know which city he'll hit first?"

"We don't. That's why every city needs to be ready."

The council broke an hour later. Itzil assigned tasks, reviewed timelines, and answered questions until the questions ran out and only the silence of people preparing for something terrible remained.

When the tent emptied, she stood alone at the map. The markers stared up at her — blue for allied forces, red for portals, black for Gravok's army. The blacks outnumbered the blues by more than two to one.

"You're worried about the scout."

Amalura's voice came from the tent entrance. The old woman stepped inside, moving with the careful economy of someone whose joints protested every step but whose will overruled them.

"I'm worried about everything," Itzil said.

"Yes, but you're worried about him specifically. It's in your shoulders. They're higher when you're thinking about him."

Itzil made a conscious effort to lower her shoulders. It didn't work. Amalura settled onto a camp stool and folded her hands in her lap.

"He's alone in Dominion territory with wounds that aren't fully healed, looking for something he's never seen, in a place he's never been. Worrying about him is rational, not sentimental."

"I didn't say it was sentimental."

"You implied it."

"I implied nothing. I observed." Amalura's working eye fixed on Itzil with the unsettling precision of a bird of prey. "He volunteered, didn't he?"

"He always volunteers. That's the problem. He treats his own survival as optional."

"Most scouts do. It's an occupational philosophy. The mission matters; the scout doesn't." Amalura paused. "You're teaching him otherwise. Whether you intend to or not."

Itzil turned away from the map. Through the tent flap, she could see the camp — soldiers preparing, engineers building, the organized chaos of an army that didn't know if it was ready but had run out of time to find out.

"He's supposed to signal every twelve hours," she said. "The first signal is due at midnight."

"And if it doesn't come?"

"Then I send people after him."

"Into Dominion territory. Risking more lives to find one man."

"To find my scout. Who has intelligence we need. Whose mission is critical to the defense of three cities."

Amalura was quiet for a moment. Then she said, softly: "You don't have to justify it to me, Itzil. You're the commander. If you say he's worth the risk, then he's worth the risk." She stood, joints popping like green wood in a fire. "But be honest with yourself about why. A commander who doesn't know her own reasons makes decisions she can't defend."

She left. Itzil stood in the empty tent and stared at the map and waited for midnight.

The signal came at eleven forty-three. A flicker of light from the northern relay station — Torvane's mirror network working exactly as designed. Short bursts, long pauses, the coded language Kaelen had devised for covert communication.

MOVING NORTH. NO CONTACT. SEARCHING FOR ANCHOR. WILL REPORT 0600.

Seventeen words. Itzil read them three times. Then she folded the message slip and put it in her pocket, where it sat against her hip like a talisman.

He was alive. He was moving. He was doing what he did best — threading through enemy territory like a ghost, invisible and relentless.

She walked to the western wall of Aravalle and looked out over the dark fields. Somewhere beyond the horizon, Gravok's army was marching. Somewhere beyond the army, Kaelen was walking alone through occupied land.

"Come back," she whispered.

The wind carried the words away. The night gave no answer.

She turned and went to inspect the gate defenses. There was work to do, and the dawn was coming, and with it, the war.
