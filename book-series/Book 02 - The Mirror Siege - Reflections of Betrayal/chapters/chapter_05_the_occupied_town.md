Chapter 5 - THE OCCUPIED TOWN

Kaelen reached Mirravale on the second day.

The town sat in a shallow valley between two ridges of grey limestone, straddling a river that had once powered three mills and now powered none. The mills were standing but silent — their wheels still, their stones cold, their purpose redirected by the Dominion's occupation into something Kaelen couldn't determine from the outside. Smoke rose from chimneys. People moved in the streets. From a distance, it looked almost normal.

Up close, the wrongness was everywhere.

He entered through the southern gate, dressed in his trader's clothes with a pack of salvaged goods slung over one shoulder — copper wire, leather scraps, a few clay jars of preserved fruit he'd bought from a roadside vendor two miles back. The gate guards were Dominion regulars in black and silver, but they barely glanced at him. A trader with goods to sell was unremarkable. The Dominion needed commerce to function, and commerce needed traders. The machine of occupation ran on the same fuel as the machine of peace: people doing ordinary things because the alternative was unthinkable.

Inside the walls, Mirravale revealed itself in layers. The first layer was order. The streets were clean — cleaner than most free towns Kaelen had visited. The buildings were maintained. The market was open and stocked. Dominion soldiers patrolled in pairs, but they didn't harass the locals. They nodded. Some even smiled. It was the most unsettling thing Kaelen had seen since entering occupied territory.

The second layer was compliance. The ash-oath sigils were everywhere — carved into door lintels, painted on shop walls, stamped into the leather of every merchant's license. Not the forced sigils he'd seen on enslaved soldiers, burned into living flesh. These were voluntary. Symbols of allegiance. The townspeople wore them on armbands and pendants, and they wore them the way people wore anything they'd been told was mandatory: with the blank acceptance of those who had decided that the cost of resistance was higher than the cost of obedience.

The third layer was fear. It lived in the spaces between the order and the compliance — in the way conversations stopped when soldiers walked past, in the way children were pulled indoors at dusk, in the way no one met a stranger's eyes for longer than a heartbeat. Mirravale was a town that had made peace with its captors, and the peace was eating it from the inside.

Kaelen set up his trader's blanket in the market square and spread his goods. He didn't need to sell anything — the cover story only required him to be visible, unremarkable, and present long enough to listen. Markets were intelligence networks. Every transaction carried information. Every haggle was a conversation, and every conversation was a thread that could be pulled.

He pulled carefully.

"Copper wire," he said to a woman examining his goods. She was middle-aged, weathered, with the calloused hands of someone who worked metal. "Good quality. Salvaged from a workshop in Ember's Crossing before the army came through."

"How much?"

"Three coppers a length. Or trade — I'm looking for information more than coin." He kept his voice light. Casual. The tone of a man making conversation, not conducting interrogation. "I'm heading north after this. Any roads I should avoid?"

The woman's eyes flickered — a micro-expression of caution, there and gone. "North road's fine. East road too. Don't go up the hill, though."

"Which hill?"

"The one with the glass house." She said it the way people said "the one with the plague pit" — a location defined by its danger, avoided by instinct. "It appeared about three months ago. Overnight. One day there was nothing on that hill but goat pasture. Next morning — glass. The whole building, just sitting there, humming."

"Humming?"

"You can hear it at night if the wind's right. Low sound. Gets into your teeth." She picked up a length of copper wire and tested its flex. "Nobody goes up there. The Dominion guards it. Sometimes you see light coming from inside — not firelight. Something else. Something that moves wrong."

Kaelen filed this. The glass house. Three months old. Humming. Guarded. Light that moved wrong. This was the mirror-anchor facility — or something connected to it. The timeline matched: three months was consistent with the portal network's operational period.

He spent the afternoon working the market. Conversations with merchants, laborers, off-duty soldiers who'd had enough ale to talk freely. The picture assembled itself piece by piece, the way intelligence always did — not in revelations but in accumulated fragments, each one meaningless alone, devastating in aggregate.

The glass house was the center of something. The Dominion had brought engineers — not soldiers, engineers — to build it. The construction had taken a week, and during that week, no one in Mirravale had slept because the sound never stopped. When it was finished, the humming settled into a rhythm that the locals had learned to ignore the way you learn to ignore a toothache: not because it stopped hurting but because the alternative was madness.

People went in. Not all of them came out. The ones who did come out didn't talk about what was inside.

And then there was the other thing. The name that kept surfacing in whispered conversations, spoken with a mixture of awe and pity and something that might have been reverence.

Miyako.

A woman. Old. Grey-haired. She'd appeared in Mirravale around the same time as the glass house, though no one connected the two events. She worked as a tutor for the Dominion governor's children — teaching calligraphy, philosophy, the old languages. She was quiet, polite, invisible in the way that servants were invisible to the powerful.

But the locals knew something the Dominion didn't. At night, Miyako moved through the town like a shadow. Supply manifests went missing. Patrol schedules were subtly altered. A shipment of ash-oath crystals destined for the front lines was found shattered in its crate, every crystal cracked along the same precise fracture line, as though someone had tapped each one with a tuning fork calibrated to the exact frequency of destruction.

No one had been caught. No one had been suspected. The Dominion attributed the disruptions to incompetence and weather and the general entropy of occupation logistics. They did not suspect a grey-haired calligraphy teacher who bowed when they passed and called them "sir."

Kaelen found her hiding spot after dark.

It was in the basement of a derelict tannery on the edge of town — a building the Dominion had condemned because the smell drove soldiers away, which was, Kaelen recognized, exactly why someone hiding from soldiers would choose it. He picked the lock on the cellar door and descended a flight of stone steps into darkness.

The knife was at his throat before he reached the bottom.

He didn't see it coming. He didn't hear it. One moment he was moving through the dark, his hand trailing the wall, his eyes adjusting. The next moment, something cold and sharp was pressing against the artery in his neck, and a grip of surprising strength had locked his right wrist behind his back.

"Don't move." The voice was female, low, controlled. Accented — the vowels clipped in a way that suggested a different linguistic tradition from the local dialect. "Who sent you?"

"No one sent me. I'm looking for the woman who's been sabotaging Dominion supply lines."

"There is no such woman."

"The calligraphy teacher who broke forty ash-oath crystals with sound resonance? That's not a common skill set."

The knife pressed harder. A bead of warmth — blood — trickled down his neck.

"I'm allied. Sun-Blade alliance. I can prove it if you let me reach my left pocket."

A pause. The grip on his wrist tightened, then released one degree. "Slowly."

He reached into his pocket with two fingers and withdrew the obsidian token — Korvain's seal, the sun-disc symbol etched into its surface. He couldn't see it in the dark, but the woman could feel it. She took it from his fingers and ran her thumb across the engraving. The knife withdrew from his throat.

A spark. A candle flame. Light bloomed in the basement, and Kaelen got his first look at Miyako.

She was small — five feet at most, with the compact, wire-strong build of someone who had trained their body to be a weapon and then spent decades forgetting that fact. Her hair was grey, pulled back in a simple knot. Her face was lined but not soft — the lines were from concentration, not age, carved by years of precision and discipline. Her eyes were dark and steady and missed nothing.

She was holding a knife that looked like it had been forged from a single piece of obsidian, its edge so fine it seemed to waver in the candlelight. In her other hand, she held Korvain's token.

"Sun-Blade," she said. Not a question. "It's been a long time since I've seen one of these."

"You know the order?"

"I was the order. A different branch. A different tradition." She set the token on a wooden crate and sheathed the knife in a motion so smooth it seemed to disappear. "The shadow school. We emphasized different things than Korvain's light-and-fire tradition. Subtlety. Patience. The art of being where you shouldn't be without anyone noticing."

"Sounds familiar."

"It should. You move like someone trained in it, even if you don't know the name." She studied him. "Scout. Alliance. Behind enemy lines alone, looking for the mirror-anchor."

"How did you know about the anchor?"

"I've been in this town for two months. I've been inside the glass house. I know what's in there, and I know what powers it, and I know why no one who goes in comes out the same." She sat on the crate and folded her hands. In the candlelight, she looked like a monk in meditation — still, centered, ancient in a way that had nothing to do with years.

"I've been expecting someone like you," she said. "Took you long enough."

Kaelen leaned against the wall. His back protested — the claw marks sending a sharp reminder that he was operating on borrowed time and borrowed healing. "Tell me about the glass house."

"Sit down first. You're bleeding through your shirt and you look like you haven't slept in three days." She produced a clay pot from behind the crate and poured something hot and herbal into a wooden cup. "Drink. Then we'll talk about the abomination on the hill."

Kaelen sat. He drank. The tea was bitter and warm and tasted of things he couldn't name.

Miyako watched him with eyes that had seen decades of decisions — good ones and bad ones and the kind that haunted you at three in the morning when the dark was thickest and the silence was loudest.

"The glass house," she began, "is not a building. It's a machine. And the mirror-anchor inside it is not a device. It's a prison."

She paused.

"And the prisoner is still alive."
