Chapter 7 - THE GLASS HOUSE

They went at midnight.

The hill above Mirravale was a dark shape against a darker sky, and the glass house sat at its crown like a blister — translucent, faintly luminous, wrong in the way that things made by human hands from inhuman knowledge are always wrong. Even from the base of the hill, Kaelen could feel it. Not a sound exactly, but a vibration — subsonic, persistent, settling into the bones of his jaw and the roots of his teeth like a dentist's drill made of silence.

Miyako moved beside him like a whisper given form. Two days of training had shown Kaelen the gap between his skills and hers. He was good — possibly the best scout alive, certainly the best in the alliance. Miyako was something else. She didn't move through space so much as negotiate with it, each step a conversation between her body and the ground, each breath timed to the rhythm of the wind. She was invisible not because she hid but because she had mastered the art of being unremarkable. The eye slid off her the way water slides off polished stone.

They climbed in silence. The path was a goat track, narrow and loose, winding through scrub brush and broken limestone. The Dominion guards were positioned at the main approach — the road that switchbacked up the eastern face of the hill. Miyako had mapped their patterns over two months of observation. The western approach, the goat track, was unguarded. The Dominion's arrogance was its own kind of blindness: they didn't guard what they didn't consider a threat.

Halfway up, Kaelen paused. The vibration was stronger here — a pressure in the air, a thickness, as though the atmosphere itself was being compressed by whatever machinery hummed inside the glass house. His claw marks ached. The new tissue was sensitive to changes in pressure and temperature, and the closer they got to the building, the worse it became.

"You feel it," Miyako said. Not a question.

"In my scars."

"The anchor's energy is disruptive. It destabilizes biological tissue at the cellular level. Long-term exposure causes deterioration — organ failure, cognitive decline. The guards rotate every four hours. Even Dalrignon doesn't stay inside for more than six."

"How long will we need?"

"Thirty minutes if everything goes right. An hour if it doesn't."

They crested the hill. The glass house was fifty yards away, and up close it was worse than Kaelen had imagined.

It was not made of glass. It was made of something that looked like glass the way a predator looks like a flower — a surface designed to attract and deceive. The walls were translucent crystal, arranged in geometric panels that caught and redirected light in patterns that hurt to follow. Each panel was etched with symbols that Kaelen didn't recognize — angular, precise, repeating in sequences that suggested a language or a mathematical proof or both. The building was roughly cubic, thirty feet on each side, with no visible door. The entry point, Miyako had explained, was a section of wall that became permeable when activated by a specific frequency — Dalrignon's own design, keyed to a tuning fork he carried.

Miyako produced a tuning fork from inside her sleeve. It was obsidian, not metal, and when she struck it against her palm, it produced no audible sound — only a vibration that Kaelen felt in his molars.

A section of wall rippled. The crystal became liquid, then transparent, then absent — a doorway-shaped gap that existed for exactly as long as the fork's vibration lasted. Miyako stepped through. Kaelen followed.

Inside, the glass house was a cathedral of nightmares.

The interior was a single open space, the crystal walls rising to a peaked ceiling thirty feet above. Every surface was reflective — not mirror-bright but mirror-deep, showing reflections that were slightly wrong. Kaelen saw himself in the nearest wall and the reflection was a half-second delayed, as though the image had to travel a great distance before returning. In the wall beyond, his reflection moved in a direction he hadn't moved. In a third, he wasn't reflected at all — just an empty space where a person should have been.

Mirror-portals hung in the air throughout the chamber. Dozens of them — shimmering vertical pools of silver-light, each framed by rings of dark crystal. Through each portal, he could see a different location: a stretch of road, a city gate, a mountain pass, a battlefield. Some showed darkness. Some showed fire. Each one hummed at a slightly different pitch, and together they created a chord that was not music but something older and more fundamental — the sound of space being folded against its will.

And at the center of it all, the anchor.

It was exactly as Miyako had described: a crystalline structure the size of a person, mounted in a cradle of dark metal that extended tendril-like supports into the floor and walls. The crystal was not transparent — it was filled with something. Light, but not natural light. A luminescence that moved and shifted and pulsed with the rhythm Kaelen had felt since the base of the hill. The rhythm of a heartbeat. The rhythm of a living thing.

He looked closer. His stomach turned.

The face inside the crystal was human. Male. Middle-aged. Frozen in an expression of agony so complete it transcended the individual features and became something universal — the face of suffering itself, captured in crystal and forced to sustain a network of portals that allowed an army to teleport across a continent. The mouth was open in a scream that had no sound. The eyes were open and aware — desperately, horribly aware.

"Gods," Kaelen whispered.

"Not gods," Miyako said beside him. Her voice was steady but her hands were not. "A man named Edren. He was a farmer in a village called Thornholt. Dalrignon selected him because his psychic resonance matched the anchor's operational frequency. He was awake when they extracted his soul. He's been awake ever since."

The crystal pulsed. The face inside shifted — the eyes moved, tracking, and for a terrible moment Kaelen was certain that Edren could see him. Could see both of them, standing in the chamber, free and mobile and alive in all the ways he was not.

Kaelen's hand found his blade. The tactical calculus was clear: destroy the crystal, collapse the portals, free whatever remained of Edren. The moral calculus was simpler: no one deserved this. Not for any cause, not for any war, not for any empire's convenience.

"The fracture point," he said. "Where?"

Miyako pointed. Where the crystal met the metal cradle, a hairline fissure ran along the junction — a structural weakness in the anchor's design, invisible unless you knew to look for it. "One concentrated strike there. The crystal will shatter and the energy discharge will collapse every portal simultaneously."

"What happens to Edren?"

"I don't know. The soul is crystallized — it may dissipate when freed. It may reform. It may simply... end." She paused. "Either way, it's better than this."

Kaelen drew his blade. The steel caught the mirror-light and reflected it in patterns that shifted across the walls. He stepped toward the anchor.

Footsteps.

Not from the entrance — from inside the chamber. From behind a portal that Kaelen had assumed was displaying a distant location. A figure stepped through the shimmering surface with the casual ease of a man walking through a door in his own home.

"I was wondering when you'd arrive."

The voice was calm, measured, and precisely modulated — the voice of a man who had calculated the probability of this moment and found it acceptable. Dalrignon stepped from the shadows of the portal and into the chamber's central light.

He was thin. That was the first thing Kaelen noticed — thin in the way of people who forgot to eat because their minds were occupied by more interesting problems. Tall, angular, with a scholar's posture and an engineer's hands — long-fingered, ink-stained, calloused at the fingertips from years of fine manipulation. His face was narrow and precise, dominated by eyes that were the color of empty mirrors — grey, reflective, showing nothing of what lay behind them.

He wore no armor. He carried no weapon. He stood in the heart of his creation with the composed authority of an artist in his studio, regarding the intruders with an expression that was not angry or afraid but curious. Professionally curious. The way an entomologist regards an interesting beetle.

"Did you come to admire my work?" He gestured at the anchor, the portals, the chamber itself. "Or to destroy it?"

"Both," Kaelen said. "It's impressive. And it's an abomination."

"Those aren't mutually exclusive." Dalrignon took a step forward. Around the chamber, the mirror-portals brightened — responding to his presence, his proximity, his will. "The greatest achievements in human history have always been built on someone's suffering. Aqueducts built by slaves. Cathedrals built on crushed bones. I simply make the cost visible."

"You trapped a man's soul in a crystal."

"I preserved a consciousness in a medium capable of sustaining a network of spatial folding points across continental distances. The fact that the consciousness was housed in a human body before I extracted it is a limitation of available materials, not a moral failing." He smiled. It was the smile of a man who had rehearsed empathy and not quite mastered the performance. "The next generation of anchors won't require organic components at all. Edren is a prototype sacrifice. His suffering is temporary on the historical scale."

Miyako moved. Kaelen saw it from the corner of his eye — the old woman shifting her weight, her hand finding the obsidian knife, her body coiling with the controlled tension of a spring compressed past its design limit.

Dalrignon saw it too. He flicked his wrist.

A portal opened — not one of the existing ones but a new one, small, the size of a dinner plate, positioned between Miyako and the anchor. Her knife thrust passed through it and emerged from a second portal behind her own head. She twisted sideways and the blade missed her ear by an inch.

"Fighting in my workshop is inadvisable," Dalrignon said. "Every surface is a potential portal. Every attack can be redirected. You'll exhaust yourselves fighting your own reflections while I watch."

He was right. The tactical situation was catastrophic. The glass house was Dalrignon's instrument, tuned to his will, responsive to his thoughts. Fighting him here was like fighting the building itself.

Kaelen looked at Miyako. She looked at him. A conversation passed between them in the language of people who understood combat — a shared assessment, a tactical decision, a division of labor agreed upon in the space of a heartbeat.

Kaelen attacked.

Not toward the anchor — toward Dalrignon. Aggressive, loud, obvious. He closed the distance with the speed that had kept him alive through a dozen infiltrations, his blade leading, his body committed to the charge.

Dalrignon opened portals. Three, four, five — small apertures that redirected Kaelen's strikes into empty space, into walls, back toward his own body. Kaelen adapted — feinting left, striking right, using the portal redirections to map their positions and adjust. Each attack was a probe, a data point, a piece of the puzzle.

He wasn't trying to hit Dalrignon. He was trying to keep Dalrignon's attention.

Behind the engineer, invisible in the chaos of redirected attacks and flashing portals, Miyako moved. The shadow-step took her — not for two seconds or three but for a full ten, her body dissolving into the fractured light of the chamber, her presence erased from the visible spectrum as completely as if she'd stepped into another world.

She reappeared at the anchor. Her obsidian knife was already moving — a single, precise strike aimed at the hairline fracture where crystal met metal.

The blade hit. The crystal cracked.

The sound was not a crash but a scream — the anchor's scream, Edren's scream, a release of compressed agony that filled the chamber like water filling a sinking ship. The portals flickered. Every portal in the room — and, Kaelen knew, every portal across the continent — stuttered like candle flames in a gust.

Dalrignon's composure shattered. For the first time, the mask of intellectual detachment fell away and what was beneath it was not rage but terror — the terror of a creator watching his creation die.

"Do you know what you've done?" His voice cracked. The portals were destabilizing — flickering faster, their surfaces rippling, their hum rising in pitch toward a frequency that made Kaelen's vision blur.

Dalrignon opened a portal. Full-sized. Behind him, an office — a desk covered in blueprints, shelves of crystal specimens, the orderly workspace of a man who lived for his research. He stepped through and the portal began to close.

Kaelen lunged for it. Too slow. The portal sealed. Dalrignon was gone.

The anchor shuddered. The crack was spreading — a network of fracture lines radiating outward from Miyako's strike, each one leaking light that pulsed with the rhythm of a heart that was finally being allowed to stop beating.

"We need to run," Kaelen said. "NOW."

Miyako pulled her knife free. The crystal screamed again — louder, higher, the sound of a soul tearing free from its prison. The portals were collapsing one by one, each winking out with a flash of mirror-light and a sound like glass breaking underwater.

They ran. Through the chamber, through the doorway in the wall that was already sealing itself, out into the night air where the hill shook beneath their feet as the glass house began to come apart. Crystal panels cracked and fell. The geometric etchings flared bright and then dark. The humming rose to a shriek and then — silence.

The anchor exploded.

A shockwave of mirror-light burst from the glass house, expanding outward in a ring of silver-white radiance that lit the hilltop like a second sunrise. In the flash, Kaelen saw it — the face inside the crystal, but changed now. Not screaming. Not agonized. The expression was shifting, transforming, becoming something else. Gratitude. Relief. Release.

Then it was gone. The face, the light, the crystal, the glass house itself — dissolving into dust that caught the wind and scattered into the dark sky like ash from a dying fire.

Kaelen lay on the hillside where the shockwave had thrown him, ears ringing, body aching, staring at the space where the glass house had been. There was nothing left. A bare hilltop. Goat pasture. Moonlight on limestone.

Beside him, Miyako sat up slowly. Her grey hair was wild, her face cut by flying crystal, her hands shaking. But her eyes were clear and steady and, for the first time since he'd met her, peaceful.

From the direction of Aravalle — far away, carried on the night wind — a sound rose.

Cheering.

The portals were down. Every mirror-portal across the continent had collapsed simultaneously. Gravok's force multiplier was gone. The siege had just become a fair fight.

Miyako looked at him. In the moonlight, with blood on her face and dust in her hair and the sound of distant cheering washing over them like a wave, she smiled.

"Not bad," she said, "for a scout."

Kaelen lay back on the grass and stared at the stars and laughed until his wounds hurt.
