Chapter 8 - THE PORTAL ENGINEER

The mirror-portals died at three minutes past midnight.

Dalrignon felt each one go — a series of small extinctions, like candle flames snuffed by invisible fingers. Twenty-six points of connection, twenty-six threads of folded space, each one severing with a psychic snap that echoed through his consciousness like the plucking of an instrument's strings. He had designed them to be extensions of himself. Their death was an amputation.

He stood in his workshop — the real one, not the glass house, that disposable shell — in a chamber beneath the Dominion's eastern fortress, surrounded by blueprints and crystal specimens and the accumulated tools of a lifetime spent bending the laws of spatial geometry into shapes that served human ambition. The chamber was deep underground, carved from living rock, lit by phosphorescent crystals that never flickered and never dimmed. He had designed the lighting himself. He had designed everything himself. That was the point. That was always the point.

The last portal collapsed. The network was dead. Months of work, thousands of calculations, the precise calibration of twenty-six spatial folding points across a continental distance — gone. Destroyed by a scout with a blade and an old woman with a knife and the fundamental inability of lesser minds to appreciate what they were destroying.

Dalrignon sat down at his workbench. His hands were shaking. Not from fear — from fury. A controlled, precise, architectural fury that organized itself not into rage but into resolution. He would rebuild. He would improve. The anchor crystal had been a first-generation design, flawed in its dependence on a single organic power source. The next iteration would be better. The one after that would be perfect.

He pulled a sheet of vellum from the stack beside his bench and began to draw.

The blueprints flowed from his pen with the automatic precision of a mind that had been redesigning the impossible since adolescence. Dalrignon had been born in a village so small it didn't have a name, the son of a clockmaker who built timepieces for merchants who never asked how they worked. He'd inherited his father's hands and his mother's capacity for abstraction, and by the age of fourteen he'd built a device that could fold a sheet of paper through a dimension that paper wasn't supposed to occupy. The paper had caught fire. He'd considered this a success.

The Dominion had found him at seventeen. Not recruited — acquired, the way a collector acquires a rare specimen. They'd given him resources, materials, subjects. The subjects had been the hardest part, at first. The first time he'd extracted a consciousness from a living body, he'd vomited for an hour afterward. The second time, he'd vomited for thirty minutes. By the fifth time, he'd stopped vomiting entirely. The mind was remarkably adaptable when given sufficient motivation and insufficient alternatives.

He didn't enjoy the suffering. That was important to understand. He wasn't cruel — cruelty implied emotional investment, and Dalrignon's emotional investments were reserved exclusively for his work. The human cost was a variable in an equation. A necessary input. He would have preferred to use inanimate materials, and one day he would solve that problem, and the suffering would become unnecessary, and history would remember him as a genius rather than a monster.

Until then, the equation required what it required.

A knock at the chamber door. Precise, unhurried. Three measured raps that Dalrignon recognized immediately — there was only one person in the Dominion who knocked with that particular rhythm, and only one person who would visit his workshop unannounced at three in the morning.

"Enter," he said, not looking up from his blueprints.

Nightshade opened the door and stepped inside.

She was, as always, immaculate. The Blood Orator dressed the way she fought — with precision, intent, and an awareness that appearance was the first weapon in any encounter. Black silk over dark leather, her hair pulled back in a style that was simultaneously practical and deliberate, her face composed in the mask of calm authority that she wore the way other people wore skin.

"The portals are down," she said.

"I'm aware."

"Volzentar wants a report."

"He can have one when I'm finished calculating the reconstruction timeline." Dalrignon's pen continued to move across the vellum. "The anchor was first-generation. Single point of failure. The scout and his companion exploited the fracture vulnerability I'd flagged in my original design documents — the ones Volzentar's military advisors dismissed as theoretical concerns."

"Theoretical concerns have a way of becoming practical ones." Nightshade moved through the workshop, examining the tools and specimens with the detached interest of someone cataloging weapons. "How long to rebuild?"

"The anchor crystal took fourteen months to grow. The soul extraction and crystallization process took another three weeks. Calibrating twenty-six portal endpoints took two months of continuous adjustment." He set down his pen and looked at her. "At minimum, seventeen months. Unless Volzentar provides additional resources."

"What kind of resources?"

"Ash-oath reserves. The stored life-force from Volzentar's slave operations. I can use concentrated psychic energy to accelerate the crystal growth process. Instead of growing a new anchor, I can force-crystallize one in weeks."

Nightshade's expression didn't change, but something shifted behind her eyes — a calculation being performed, costs being weighed against benefits. "Those reserves are earmarked for the Great Gate. Volzentar won't divert them for tactical portals."

"Then Volzentar can wait seventeen months for his force multiplier. Or he can build faster portals now and replenish the reserves later." Dalrignon turned back to his blueprints. "That's a strategic decision. I build what I'm told to build."

Nightshade was quiet for a moment. She moved to his workbench and looked at the new blueprints — the redesigned anchor, the improved portal endpoints, the failsafe systems he was adding to prevent another single-point collapse.

"These are different from the originals," she said.

"Better. The new design uses distributed power — six smaller anchors instead of one large one. Destroying one doesn't collapse the network. It reduces capacity by one-sixth. To bring down the entire system, an enemy would have to find and destroy all six simultaneously."

"And the power source?"

"Each anchor requires one-sixth the psychic energy. Smaller souls. Less suffering per unit." He said it the way someone might describe using smaller batteries in a device — a technical consideration, not a moral one. "More efficient. Less waste."

Nightshade studied him. Dalrignon had never been able to read her — she was the only person in the Dominion whose emotional architecture was as opaque to him as his was to others. They were similar in that way. Both of them operated behind walls of competence and control, using different tools for different purposes but sharing the same fundamental relationship with the world: it was a system to be understood, manipulated, and ultimately mastered.

"Volzentar has a new assignment for you," she said. "Not the portals. Something else."

"I'm busy."

"Something bigger." She placed a scroll on his workbench. It was sealed with Volzentar's personal sigil — black wax impressed with the split crown. "He wants you to review the ancient texts on the Great Gate. Not the engineering specifications — those you already have. The historical accounts. The records of the original builders."

Dalrignon looked at the scroll. Despite himself, he was interested. The Great Gate was the summit of his ambition — a permanent, stabilized portal capable of bridging not just distance but dimensions. The mirror-portals were parlor tricks in comparison. Toys. The Great Gate was the work that would define him, the achievement that would outlast the Dominion, the empire, the age itself.

"The original builders were amateurs," he said. "They sealed the Gate because they couldn't control what came through. I won't make that mistake."

"Volzentar doesn't want you to control what comes through. He wants you to understand it." Nightshade moved toward the door. "The Weeping One says the Gate will open. Not if — when. Volzentar wants to make sure we're on the right side of it when it does."

She paused at the threshold. "One more thing. The scout who destroyed your anchor — Kaelen. He's become a priority. Volzentar wants intelligence on everyone close to the Sun-Blade bearer. Her team. Her allies. Her vulnerabilities."

"I'm an engineer, not a spy."

"No. But you saw the scout's face. You spoke to him. And you let him go." Her voice was neutral, but the words carried weight. "Volzentar noticed that."

Dalrignon said nothing. Nightshade left. The door closed with a soft click that was somehow louder than a slam.

He sat alone in his workshop, surrounded by the tools of his trade and the blueprints of his ambition, and stared at the sealed scroll on his bench. The Great Gate. The work of a lifetime. The thing that would make everything he'd done — every extracted soul, every crystallized consciousness, every calculated cruelty — worth it.

He broke the seal and began to read.

The ancient texts were written in a language that predated the Dominion by centuries — angular symbols arranged in spiraling patterns that encoded information in both sequence and geometry. Dalrignon had taught himself the language years ago, the way he taught himself everything: through obsessive analysis, pattern recognition, and the absolute refusal to accept that any system of knowledge was beyond his comprehension.

The texts described the original Gate. Not the engineering — that was in the specifications he already possessed. These texts described what the Gate connected to. What waited on the other side. What had pressed against the seal for a thousand years with the patient, relentless hunger of something that did not experience time the way humans did.

Dalrignon read for three hours. When he finished, he set the scroll down and stared at the wall of his workshop.

For the first time in his adult life, the equation in his mind had a variable he couldn't resolve. A factor that exceeded his models. A magnitude that made the mirror-portals, the anchor crystals, the entire Dominion war machine look like what they were: children playing with fire in a room they didn't know was made of paper.

He picked up his pen. His hand was steady. His mind was clear.

On a fresh sheet of vellum, he wrote two words:

BUILD FASTER.

Then he returned to his blueprints, and worked until dawn painted the walls of his underground chamber with light that never reached him.
