Chapter 9 - THE SIEGE OF ARAVALLE

The war-beasts came with the dawn.

Itzil stood on the western wall of Aravalle and watched them emerge from the treeline like nightmares given flesh. Massive creatures — fifteen feet at the shoulder, armored in plates of bone and dark iron, their eyes glowing with the dull crimson of ash-oath magic. They moved in formation, which was worse than if they'd charged in a frenzy. Frenzy could be predicted. Formation meant intelligence. Formation meant a commander who knew how to use monsters as precision instruments.

Behind the beasts, the infantry. Twelve thousand soldiers in black and silver, marching in columns that stretched back along the road until they disappeared into the morning haze. Their boots struck the earth in unison — a sound like a single enormous heartbeat, steady and relentless and growing louder with every second.

Gravok's army had arrived.

"Signal mirrors are active," Torvane's voice crackled from the relay station behind Itzil. She could picture him hunched over his equipment, spectacles catching the light, fingers dancing across the brass controls of the signal array he'd built in three sleepless nights. "Sundrift and Ironpool are standing by. Jagren confirms defensive positions. Neyla confirms medical readiness."

"Good." Itzil drew the Sun-Blade. It came alive in her hand — golden light blooming from the steel like sunrise compressed into a weapon. The warmth flooded up her arm and settled in her chest, and for a moment the fear receded. Not gone — never gone — but manageable. The blade didn't remove doubt. It burned beside it.

Commander Rethane appeared at her shoulder, her iron-grey hair hidden beneath a helm, her veteran's eyes scanning the approaching army with the clinical assessment of someone who had calculated odds for a living and knew that these odds were bad.

"Five thousand against twelve thousand," Rethane said. "Plus beasts."

"The walls help."

"Walls help until they don't." Rethane looked at the Sun-Blade. The golden light reflected in her eyes. "That helps more. How long can you sustain it?"

"Longer than I could a month ago. Shorter than I'd like." Itzil had been training — not with Korvain, who was too far away, but alone, pushing the blade's manifestation further each day. She could hold the full blaze for twenty minutes before exhaustion set in. After that, the light dimmed to a glow, and after that, nothing. "I'll use it in bursts. Save the full power for the moments that matter."

"Everything's going to matter today."

The army halted five hundred yards from the walls. A single rider separated from the main body — not on horseback but on one of the war-beasts, a creature larger and darker than the others, with scars across its muzzle that suggested it had fought its own kind and won. The rider was a silhouette against the dawn, but Itzil didn't need to see his face. She knew who it was.

Gravok.

Even at distance, he was enormous. A mountain of black iron and beast-bone armor, sitting atop his war-beast with the casual authority of a man who had never in his life encountered something he couldn't break. He didn't carry a flag of parley. He didn't shout demands. He simply sat there, looking at the walls, and the silence was louder than any war cry.

Then he raised his axe — a weapon so large it should have required two hands, which he held in one — and pointed it at the gate.

The army charged.

The first wave hit the western wall like a wave hitting a cliff. Scaling ladders crashed against the stone. Grappling hooks arced over the battlements. War-beasts hurled themselves at the gate, their armored skulls striking the reinforced timber with impacts that shook the wall beneath Itzil's feet.

She fought. The Sun-Blade blazed in her hands, cutting golden arcs through the dawn air. Every strike that connected with an ash-oathed soldier sent a pulse of light through the sigil on their chest — not breaking it, not yet, but disrupting it momentarily, causing them to stumble, to hesitate, to remember for a single heartbeat that they were human beings fighting against their will.

Rethane commanded the wall defense with the brutal efficiency of a twenty-year veteran. Archers in rotating lines — fire, reload, fire. Boiling sand poured through murder holes onto soldiers at the base of the wall. Torvane's ward-disruptors — salvaged from Dominion technology — projected fields that disrupted ash-oath control in a ten-foot radius, creating pockets of confusion in the enemy ranks.

It wasn't enough. It was never going to be enough. Twelve thousand soldiers with war-beast support against five thousand defenders — the math was a death sentence written in iron and blood.

The gate buckled on the third impact. A war-beast — the largest Itzil had seen, a creature of pure muscle and rage — hit the reinforced timber with its full weight. The hinges screamed. The crossbar cracked. Splinters the size of javelins flew inward, and through the gap, Dominion soldiers poured like water through a broken dam.

Itzil dropped from the wall.

She landed in the gateway — the narrow killing ground between the outer gate and the inner barricade — and planted herself in the center of the breach. The Sun-Blade erupted to full power. Golden light filled the gateway like a second sun, blinding the soldiers who poured through, turning the narrow space into a furnace of radiance.

She fought with everything Korvain had taught her. Not the forms — the forms were too slow, too structured for the chaos of a breach defense. She fought with instinct, with clarity, with the desperate precision of a woman who knew that if she fell, the people behind her would die. Every strike was purposeful. Every movement was efficient. She didn't waste energy on flourishes or displays. She cut and blocked and cut again, and the golden light of the Sun-Blade left afterimages in the air like the trails of falling stars.

The Dominion soldiers were good. Disciplined, well-armed, fighting with the mechanical precision of ash-oath compulsion. But they were fighting one at a time in a narrow space, and Itzil was fighting for her life, which gave her an advantage that no amount of training could replicate.

She held the breach for eleven minutes. Eleven minutes of continuous combat, the longest sustained engagement of her life. When Rethane's reserve company finally arrived to reinforce the gateway, Itzil's arms were shaking and the Sun-Blade had dimmed to a glow, but the breach was held and the dead were stacked three deep on the Dominion side.

She leaned against the inner barricade, breathing hard, blood on her hands that wasn't hers, and looked up at the sky. The sun was fully risen now. The battle had been raging for less than an hour. It felt like a lifetime.

A runner appeared at her elbow — young, terrified, out of breath. "Commander! Signal from the relay station. The mirror-portals — they're flickering!"

Itzil's heart lurched. Flickering. Kaelen's work was taking effect. The portals were destabilizing. But flickering meant they were still active — still capable of moving troops, still capable of delivering reinforcements to Gravok's position.

Through the gateway, past the barricade and the dead and the soldiers still fighting, she could see the Dominion's rear lines. And there — shimmering in the morning light like vertical pools of mercury — the mirror-portals. Soldiers were still coming through. Not as many as before — the flow was interrupted, stuttering, like water from a pipe with air in the line. But they were still coming.

"Come on, Kaelen," she whispered.

The battle raged on. Rethane's reserves held the gate while engineers worked frantically to reinforce it. On the walls, archers continued their deadly rhythm. Torvane's ward-disruptors created islands of chaos in the Dominion ranks.

Then the portals flickered again. And again. And then — at three minutes past noon — they went dark.

All of them. Simultaneously. Like candles extinguished by a single breath.

The Dominion army faltered. The soldiers who had been mid-transit — halfway through a portal when it collapsed — simply vanished. The reinforcement pipeline was severed. The flow of fresh troops stopped. And in the sudden silence where the portals' hum had been, Itzil heard something she hadn't expected.

Confusion. In the Dominion ranks. Officers shouting orders that contradicted each other. War-beasts turning in circles, their handlers struggling to maintain control without the steady pulse of the portal network's energy. The organized machine of Gravok's army was stuttering, stumbling, losing the rhythm that had made it so deadly.

Itzil climbed the wall. She stood on the battlement, the Sun-Blade blazing in her hand, and looked out at an army that had just lost its greatest advantage. Twelve thousand soldiers, stranded. No portals. No reinforcements. No escape.

A horn sounded from the south. Jagren's horn — the distinctive brass call he'd claimed from a fallen Dominion officer and refused to surrender because, in his words, "it has better acoustics than anything our side makes." The Sundrift garrison was coming. The portal to Sundrift had collapsed, meaning Gravok couldn't threaten it anymore, and Jagren had immediately marched.

Itzil raised the Sun-Blade above her head. The light caught the morning sun and doubled — a beacon visible for miles, a signal to every allied soldier within sight: the tide has turned.

"Open the gates," she said.

Rethane looked at her. "Commander—"

"Open the gates. We're counterattacking."

The gates opened. Itzil led the charge.
