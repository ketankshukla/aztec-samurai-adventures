Chapter 10 - THE ANCHOR FALLS

The glass house was dying around them, and Kaelen was running out of time to care.

The shockwave from the cracked anchor had destabilized the entire structure. Crystal panels were fracturing in sequence — a cascade of destruction that rippled outward from the central chamber like cracks spreading through ice. Each panel that broke released a burst of mirror-light that strobed the interior, turning the glass house into a disorienting kaleidoscope of flash and shadow.

Miyako ran ahead of him, her small form navigating the collapsing architecture with an instinct that bordered on precognition. She ducked a falling beam of dark metal without looking up. She sidestepped a burst of mirror-energy without breaking stride. She moved the way water moves through a breaking dam — finding the paths that existed for fractions of a second before they closed.

Behind them, the anchor screamed.

Not the subsonic hum Kaelen had felt since the base of the hill — this was audible, a sound that existed at the intersection of frequency and agony. The cracked crystal was shedding energy in pulses, each one brighter and more violent than the last. The mirror-portals that still flickered in the chamber were collapsing one by one, each winking out with a flash and a sound like a bell being struck and silenced in the same instant.

"The fracture is propagating," Miyako called back without slowing. "The crystal's internal structure is unraveling. When it reaches critical instability—"

"It explodes. I gathered."

"Not an explosion. A release. Every quantum of psychic energy stored in that crystal — every fragment of Edren's consciousness — will discharge simultaneously. The blast radius will be approximately—"

"Can we discuss the math AFTER we're outside?"

They reached the wall where they'd entered. Miyako struck the obsidian tuning fork against her palm. The vibration was weaker now — the building's own resonance was interfering, creating harmonics that fought the fork's frequency. The wall rippled but didn't open.

Miyako struck harder. The wall shimmered. A gap appeared — not a clean doorway but a ragged opening, the crystal edges jagged and unstable, the aperture contracting even as it formed.

"Go," Miyako said.

Kaelen went. He dove through the narrowing gap, feeling the crystal edges brush his shoulders, the mirror-energy crackling against his skin like static electricity amplified a thousandfold. He hit the ground outside and rolled, the night air rushing into his lungs like a reprieve.

Miyako came through behind him — not diving but stepping, precise even in extremity, her body passing through the gap with millimeters to spare before the wall sealed shut behind her.

They ran down the hill. The goat track was treacherous in the dark — loose stones and scrub brush and the steep grade fighting every step. Kaelen's back screamed. The claw marks had reopened again — he could feel the warm pulse of blood soaking through his shirt, the tissue that Neyla had painstakingly healed tearing apart under the strain of repeated abuse.

He didn't slow down. Slowing down meant dying. The equation was simple even when everything else was complicated.

They were halfway down the hill when the anchor reached critical instability.

The sound stopped first. The screaming, the humming, the cascade of breaking crystal — all of it ceased simultaneously, as though someone had pressed a mute button on reality. For one heartbeat, the hill was perfectly silent. Kaelen could hear his own breathing, his own heartbeat, the crunch of his boots on loose stone.

Then the light came.

It erupted from the glass house in a column of silver-white radiance that punched through the roof and into the sky like a searchlight aimed at the stars. The column held for three seconds — an eternity compressed into a pillar of released consciousness — and then it expanded outward in a sphere of mirror-light that consumed the glass house, the hilltop, and everything within a hundred yards of the anchor's location.

The shockwave hit Kaelen like a wall of warm wind. It threw him off his feet and sent him tumbling down the slope, his body bouncing off rocks and scrub in a series of impacts that would have been agonizing if he'd had time to process them. He came to rest against a boulder at the base of the hill, winded, bruised, his vision filled with afterimages of silver light.

He lay still. Breathing. Counting his limbs — all present, all functional, all protesting. The claw marks on his back were a symphony of pain, but it was the familiar pain of damaged tissue, not the sharp alarm of something newly broken.

"Miyako."

"Here." Her voice came from somewhere to his left. He turned his head and saw her sitting against a limestone outcrop, grey hair wild, face cut by flying debris, one hand pressed against her ribs in a way that suggested bruised bones or worse. But she was alive and conscious and looking up at the hilltop with an expression he couldn't read.

He followed her gaze.

The glass house was gone. Not destroyed — dissolved. Where it had stood, there was nothing but bare hilltop. Goat pasture and limestone and moonlight. The crystal, the metal, the portals, the anchor — all of it reduced to a fine dust that the wind was already carrying away. The only evidence that anything had been there was a circle of scorched earth where the building's foundation had rested, already cooling in the night air.

And in the center of the circle, where the anchor had been, a single point of light hung in the air. Faint. Warm. Pulsing with the rhythm of a heartbeat that was slowing — not stopping, but settling, like a heart that had been racing for months and was finally being allowed to rest.

Edren.

Or what remained of him. Not a body — that had been destroyed in the extraction process. Not a mind — that had been crystallized and compressed beyond recognition. Something else. Something that existed in the space between what a person was and what a person left behind. A presence. An echo. A gratitude so vast it transcended the individual consciousness that generated it.

The light pulsed once more. Bright. Warm. And then it rose — lifting from the scorched circle like a lantern released into a still sky, drifting upward through the dark, growing smaller and fainter until it was indistinguishable from the stars.

Kaelen watched it go. Beside him, Miyako watched it go. Neither spoke. There were no words for what they'd witnessed — the release of a soul from a prison designed by human intelligence and powered by human cruelty. No eulogy was adequate. No commentary was necessary.

The light vanished into the stars. The night was dark again.

And from the direction of Aravalle — far away, carried on the wind that still tasted of mirror-dust and dissolution — a sound rose. Distant at first, then growing, swelling, becoming unmistakable.

Cheering.

Every mirror-portal across the continent had collapsed. Kaelen knew this because the absence was palpable — a silence where the subsonic hum had been, a stillness in the air where the portal energy had vibrated. The network was dead. Gravok's force multiplier was gone. The siege of three cities had just become a conventional battle, and in a conventional battle, fortified walls and determined defenders had the advantage.

Miyako stood slowly, one hand still pressed to her ribs. She looked at Kaelen. In the starlight, with dust in her hair and blood on her face and the distant cheering washing over them like a wave, she looked ancient and young simultaneously — a woman who had spent decades running from a fight and had finally turned around.

"It's done," she said.

"The portals are done. The war isn't."

"No. But the war just got fairer." She offered him her hand. "Can you walk?"

He took it. She pulled him up with a strength that belied her size. His back protested. His legs protested. Every part of his body that had an opinion expressed it loudly and negatively.

He walked anyway. That was what scouts did. They walked into places they shouldn't be, did things that shouldn't be possible, and walked out again. The walking was the important part. The walking meant you were still alive.

They descended the hill together, leaving the bare hilltop behind them. Ahead, the lights of Mirravale glowed in the valley — a town that would wake tomorrow to find the glass house gone, the humming silenced, the weight of occupation one degree lighter.

Behind them, the wind erased the last traces of mirror-dust from the hilltop. By morning, there would be nothing left. Just goat pasture and limestone and the memory of a farmer named Edren who had been taken from his life and used as a battery and finally, after months of silent screaming, set free.

Kaelen didn't look back. Looking back was a luxury scouts couldn't afford.

But he memorized the name. Edren. He added it to the list he carried — the list of people whose suffering he'd witnessed and couldn't undo. It was a long list. It grew longer with every mission. One day it would be long enough to fill a book, and on that day, he would sit down and write it, and the world would know what had been done in the dark while it wasn't paying attention.

But not today. Today, there was a war to fight and a team to rejoin and a commander standing on a wall somewhere, waiting for him to come back.

He walked south, toward the allied lines, toward Itzil, toward whatever came next.

Miyako walked beside him. They didn't speak. The silence between them was comfortable — the silence of two people who had looked into the same abyss and chosen the same direction.

The stars wheeled overhead. The cheering faded into the distance. The war continued.

But the mirrors were broken, and the siege would never be the same.
