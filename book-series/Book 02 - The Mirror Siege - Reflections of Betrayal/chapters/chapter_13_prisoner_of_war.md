Chapter 13 - PRISONER OF WAR

Gravok looked smaller in chains.

It was an illusion — the man was still seven feet of muscle and violence, still broad enough to fill the cell they'd put him in, still carrying the scars and the bulk and the physical presence of someone who had spent his life being the largest and most dangerous thing in any room. But chains had a way of diminishing people. They reduced the threat to the contained, the active to the passive, the commander to the captive.

Itzil studied him through the iron bars. The cell was in Aravalle's military stockade — a stone building with thick walls and small windows, designed for holding dangerous prisoners during peacetime and apparently adequate for holding beast commanders during war. Gravok sat on the stone bench that served as a bed, his wrists shackled to the wall by chains long enough to allow movement but not enough to reach the door. His legs were similarly restrained.

He hadn't spoken since his capture. The guards reported that he ate the food they brought, drank the water, used the bucket in the corner with the unselfconscious practicality of a man who'd lived rough for most of his life. He slept when it was dark. He sat when it was light. He did not pace, did not rage, did not test his chains or threaten his guards.

He waited. With the patience of a predator who understood that captivity was temporary and that the prey would eventually come to him.

Itzil opened the cell door and stepped inside.

Two guards flanked the entrance, hands on weapons. Rethane had argued against this — a commander interrogating a prisoner personally was a risk, tactically and psychologically. Itzil had listened politely and then done it anyway. Some things required a direct approach. This was one of them.

Gravok watched her enter. His eyes — small, dark, deeply set beneath a ridge of scarred brow — tracked her with the same focused attention he'd shown on the battlefield. He was assessing her. Cataloging. A warrior's mind never stopped calculating threat levels, even in chains.

"Beast Commander Gravok," Itzil said. She didn't sit. Standing gave her the height advantage, which, given his size, she needed. "I'm going to ask you questions. You can answer them or not. I won't threaten you and I won't torture you. When we're done, you'll go back to sitting in this cell eating food that's better than what most of my soldiers get."

Gravok said nothing. His expression was unreadable — not hostile, not cooperative, just present. Watching.

"Why did Volzentar send you?" she asked.

Silence. Ten seconds. Twenty. Then, in a voice like the grinding of tectonic plates: "Because I'm the best he has for what he needed done."

"And what did he need done?"

"Break your alliance. Burn your cities. Kill enough people that the survivors would remember what resistance costs." He said it without emotion — stating facts, not boasting. "Standard conquest protocol. I've done it forty times."

"You failed."

"I failed." No defensiveness. No excuses. The acknowledgment of a professional who had run the numbers and come up short. "The portals gave me the advantage. Without the portals, I needed three-to-one numerical superiority against fortified positions. I had two-to-one. Insufficient."

Itzil filed this. Gravok was not stupid. She'd known this — stupid men didn't command armies of twelve thousand with the precision he'd shown. But hearing him analyze his own defeat with clinical detachment reinforced something important: the Dominion's commanders were professionals. They learned from failures. Whatever mistakes Gravok had made, Volzentar would not repeat.

"The relics," she said. "How many does the Dominion have?"

Gravok's eyes narrowed. The first sign of resistance — not to the question but to the information it represented. Relic intelligence was strategic. Sharing it meant betraying more than tactical details.

Itzil waited. She didn't repeat the question. She didn't lean forward or change her tone or employ any of the interrogation techniques she'd read about in Amalura's books. She simply stood there, steady and patient, and let the silence work.

Gravok shifted on his bench. The chains clinked — a small sound in the stone cell, intimate and ordinary.

"Four," he said. "When I left the capital, the Dominion held four of the seven relics. The Ember Core, the Tide Pearl, the Shadow Lens, and the Crown Fragment." He paused. "You have one. The Sun-Blade temple held the Solara Seal before the raid. I assume your people secured it."

"We did."

"That leaves two unaccounted for. Volzentar has people looking for them. So should you."

Itzil absorbed this. Four relics out of seven. The Great Gate needed all seven to open, plus a massive energy source — the stored life-force of ash-oath slaves. The Dominion was more than halfway there.

"The Great Gate," she said. "What do you know about it?"

"I'm a soldier, not a scholar. I know it's old. I know Volzentar wants it open. I know that whatever is on the other side is what he's really fighting for — the war, the conquest, the relics, it's all a means to an end." Gravok's expression changed — something flickered in his eyes that might have been the distant ancestor of discomfort. "The scientists and the priests handle the Gate. Dalrignon builds the tools. The Weeping One provides the intelligence. I just kill people."

"The Weeping One."

The discomfort became visible. Gravok — a man who had faced Itzil's Sun-Blade without flinching, who had commanded war-beasts and laid siege to cities and killed more people than most men could count — looked uncomfortable.

"She sits in the dark beneath the palace," he said. "She cries all the time. Even Volzentar doesn't stay long." He used the words the way soldiers use the names of diseases — acknowledging their existence while maintaining a careful distance. "I've been in her chamber once. Just once. Volzentar took me there before my first campaign. Said it would help me understand what we were fighting for."

"What happened?"

"She spoke to me." His voice dropped. Not to a whisper — to a register, as though the words needed to be formed at a frequency that the walls couldn't absorb. "She knew my name. She knew my mother's name. She knew the name of the first man I killed and the name of the last woman I loved and the name of the fear I carry that I've never told anyone. She said them all, one after another, like reading from a list. And then she told me how I would die."

The cell was very quiet.

"How?" Itzil asked.

"She said I would die in chains. In a stone room. Listening to someone ask me questions." He looked at Itzil. "She said I would answer because I was tired. Because the person asking would treat me like a man instead of a weapon. And because by the time I finished talking, I would understand that the empire I served was building a door that should never be opened."

Itzil felt the temperature in the cell drop. Not physically — metaphysically. The Weeping One's predictions had the weight of things that had already happened. Not prophecy in the mystical sense. Something worse. Certainty.

"The Great Gate," Gravok continued. "Volzentar doesn't tell his commanders what's on the other side. He tells us it's power. Liberation. The next step in human evolution. The priests and the true believers eat it up. But I've been in the Weeping One's chamber, and I've heard her cry, and I know this: whatever is on the other side of that Gate, it scares a woman who can see the future. That should terrify you more than anything my army ever did."

Itzil was quiet for a long moment. The guards shifted uncomfortably at the door. The weight of Gravok's words pressed against the walls.

"One more question," she said. "Volzentar sent you to break my alliance. Twelve thousand soldiers, mirror-portals, war-beasts. But you said something to Kaelen — my scout. You said Volzentar deployed you to test me. Which is it?"

Gravok's expression shifted again. Not discomfort this time — something closer to pity. Which, from a man in chains, was deeply unsettling.

"Both," he said. "Volzentar never does one thing at a time. The siege was real. The test was also real. He wanted to see what you'd do when the pressure was maximum. Would you sacrifice a city to save two? Would you send your people to die? Would you kill me or spare me?"

"I spared you."

"You did." He held her gaze. "That interests him more than anything else you could have done. If you'd killed me, he'd have written you off as conventional. Dangerous but predictable. Sparing me means you're something else. Something he hasn't seen before."

"What does Volzentar do when someone interests him?"

Gravok was quiet. The chains clinked as he shifted his weight. When he spoke, his voice carried the gravity of a man delivering a truth he wished he didn't know.

"He gets interested. And then he gets personal. The next attack won't be an army, Sun-Blade bearer. It'll be something you can't fight with a sword. He'll find the people you love. He'll find the things you're afraid of. And he'll use them like weapons."

He leaned back against the wall and closed his eyes. The conversation was over. Not because he'd been ordered to stop but because he'd said what needed to be said and further words would only dilute it.

Itzil stood in the cell for a moment longer. Then she turned and walked out. The guards closed the door behind her. The lock engaged with a sound like a period at the end of a sentence.

She walked through the stockade corridors, past cells holding captured Dominion officers and ash-oathed soldiers whose sigils Neyla was studying, past guards who saluted and runners who brought reports and all the ordinary machinery of a military alliance that had just won a major battle and didn't know yet that the real war hadn't started.

She found Amalura in the command tent, reading.

"He says Volzentar has four relics," Itzil said. "He says the Weeping One is real. He says the next attack won't be an army."

Amalura looked up from her text. Her working eye was sharp. Her expression was the one she wore when the pieces of a puzzle were assembling themselves into a picture she didn't want to see.

"What did he say about Volzentar's interest in you?"

"He said Volzentar gets personal."

Amalura was quiet for a moment. Then she said, softly: "The texts describe a pattern. When the Dominion encounters a threat it can't defeat by force, it doesn't escalate. It infiltrates. It finds the person at the center and it breaks them. Not with armies. With precision."

Itzil thought of her team. Kaelen behind enemy lines. Jagren recovering from a duel that had changed something inside him. Torvane building machines that might save them all. Neyla touching ash-oaths and discovering that compassion might be a weapon.

"What does Volzentar do when someone passes his test?" she'd asked Gravok.

He gets interested.

She sat down at the war table and stared at the markers — blue for allies, black for enemies, red for portals that no longer existed. The board had changed. The pieces had moved. And the player on the other side of the table was no longer content to use pawns.

The king was moving. And Itzil didn't know the game.
