Chapter 15 - TORVANE'S MACHINES

Torvane had never been comfortable with silence, which was ironic for a man who spent most of his life in it.

The workshop he'd claimed — a stone-walled storage room in the Aravalle garrison, repurposed with Rethane's grudging permission — was the loudest quiet place in the camp. No voices. No footsteps. No commands or responses or any of the human sounds that filled the world outside. Just the click of gears, the hiss of solder, the soft scrape of a file against metal, and the constant, low-level hum of Torvane's mind turning problems into solutions.

He worked best alone. He always had. People were wonderful in theory and exhausting in practice — unpredictable, emotional, prone to asking questions at the exact moment when the answer was balanced on the tip of his concentration like a drop of water on the edge of a blade. He didn't dislike people. He simply processed them differently than most, the way a person who reads music differently than someone who hears it experiences the same composition through a different architecture of understanding.

The mirror-portal fragments were spread across his workbench like the pieces of a dissected insect. He'd collected them from the battlefield — shards of the dark crystal that had framed the portals, fragments of the metal conduits that had connected them to the anchor network, scraps of the resonance tuning mechanisms that Dalrignon had designed to maintain spatial stability across continental distances.

They were beautiful. That was the problem.

Torvane understood beauty in engineering the way Jagren understood beauty in combat — instinctively, viscerally, with an appreciation that transcended moral judgment. The mirror-portal technology was brilliant. The crystal-metal lattice structure was elegant. The resonance tuning was a masterwork of precision calibration. Every component spoke of a mind that understood the fundamental architecture of space and had devised methods to bend it like a blacksmith bends iron.

And every component was powered by human suffering. The crystal fragments still carried traces of psychic resonance — the echo of Edren's consciousness, imprinted into the material at the molecular level. When Torvane held a fragment to the light, he could feel it — not with his hands but with something deeper, an awareness that lived in the same part of his mind that solved equations and built devices. A whisper. A shadow. The ghost of a scream preserved in glass.

He set the fragment down and cleaned his spectacles. A nervous habit. The lenses didn't need cleaning — they needed to be somewhere other than on his face for a moment, giving his eyes a rest and his mind a reset.

He was building three things from the salvaged technology.

The first was a ward-disruptor — an improved version of the devices he'd deployed during the siege. The originals had projected fields that disrupted ash-oath control within a ten-foot radius. The improved version, incorporating Dominion crystal components, would extend the range to fifty feet. In a battlefield context, each ward-disruptor would create a zone of freedom — a space where ash-oathed soldiers would temporarily regain their will, their sigils suppressed by the device's interference.

The second was a signal array — the next generation of his mirror communication system. The current relay stations used reflected sunlight during the day and lantern arrays at night. Effective but limited. The new system would use the portal crystals' resonance properties to transmit encoded messages at the speed of light, regardless of weather, time of day, or line-of-sight requirements. Instant, secure, continent-wide communication.

The third was the device that occupied most of his attention and all of his concern.

It sat on the center of his workbench, surrounded by tools and notes and the accumulated detritus of obsessive engineering. It looked like a compass mated with a music box — a brass housing containing a crystal sensor suspended in a gyroscopic mount, with a dial on the face calibrated in units that Torvane had invented because no existing measurement system was adequate for what the device detected.

A portal detector.

He'd built the prototype before the siege — a crude instrument that could sense mirror-portal energy within a mile radius. The improved version was more sensitive by orders of magnitude. It could detect portal-energy signatures at a distance of fifty miles. It could distinguish between active portals and residual traces. It could identify the unique frequency of individual portal endpoints.

And it was pinging.

That was the problem.

The mirror-portals were destroyed. The anchor was dust. Dalrignon's network was dead. There should have been nothing for the detector to find — a flat line, a null reading, the electromagnetic equivalent of silence.

Instead, the detector showed a faint, steady pulse at the extreme edge of its range. Not the frequency of Dalrignon's portals — those had a characteristic harmonic signature that Torvane had cataloged during the siege. This was different. Older. Deeper. A frequency that existed beneath the ones Dalrignon had used, like a bass note beneath a melody — the foundation that the melody was built upon.

Torvane had spent three days analyzing the signal. He'd ruled out instrumentation error, atmospheric interference, geological resonance, and seventeen other potential false-positive sources. The signal was real. It was coming from somewhere south-southeast of Aravalle. And it was old.

How old? The resonance pattern was degraded in a way that suggested centuries of continuous operation. Not the sharp, clean pulse of Dalrignon's engineered portals but the worn, smooth rhythm of something that had been running for so long its energy signature had weathered like stone.

Torvane set down his tools and looked at the detector. The crystal sensor pulsed — a faint blue-green glow, rhythmic, steady, patient. Like a heartbeat. Like a machine that had been left running when its operators walked away and had continued its function for a thousand years because no one had told it to stop.

He picked up the detector and walked to the command tent.

Amalura was there. She was always there — seated at the corner desk she'd claimed, surrounded by texts and scrolls and the organized chaos of a scholar who processed information the way Torvane processed engineering: continuously, comprehensively, with a focus that excluded everything not immediately relevant to the problem at hand.

"I need to show you something," Torvane said.

He placed the detector on the desk. The blue-green pulse reflected in Amalura's working eye. She studied it — the device, the display, the readings — with the sharp, methodical attention that made her the most formidable intellect Torvane had ever encountered.

"This isn't Dalrignon's work," she said after a minute.

"No. The frequency is different. Older. The resonance degradation suggests continuous operation over a period of—" He hesitated, because the number sounded absurd. "Centuries. Possibly a millennium."

Amalura went very, very still.

The stillness was not surprise. It was recognition. The look of someone encountering something they'd read about in texts so old the ink had faded to ghosts on parchment, something they'd cataloged as theoretical, historical, safely distant — and realizing that it was none of those things. It was here. It was now. It was pulsing on a brass compass on a desk in a military camp.

"Show me the frequency pattern," she said.

Torvane adjusted the detector's display. The waveform appeared — a smooth, repeating curve with a characteristic asymmetry that distinguished it from any natural electromagnetic source. Amalura stared at it. Then she stood, crossed to her desk, and pulled a scroll from the bottom of a stack that looked like it hadn't been disturbed in years.

She unrolled the scroll beside the detector. The parchment was ancient — brown with age, fragile at the edges, covered in symbols that Torvane recognized as the same angular script Dalrignon had used on the glass house's walls. In the margin of the scroll, someone had drawn a waveform.

It matched the detector's display exactly.

"The Great Gate," Amalura said. Her voice was different now — lower, tighter, carrying a weight that Torvane had never heard from her before. "The sealed portal. The one the Dominion is trying to reopen." She pointed at the scroll. "This is from the original builder's notes. The frequency you're detecting is the Gate's standby resonance — the signal it emits while sealed. It's been emitting this signal for a thousand years."

Torvane's mind ran the implications with the cold, automatic precision of an engineer extrapolating from data to conclusion. "If this is the Gate's standby signal, then Dalrignon didn't invent the mirror-portal technology. He reverse-engineered it. From the Gate."

"Yes."

"Which means the portal network wasn't an independent system. It was a derivative. A subset. Like building a flashlight from the components of a star."

"Yes."

"And the Gate itself — the source technology — is still operational. Still running. Still emitting a signal that my detector can pick up at fifty miles."

Amalura rolled the scroll closed. Her hands were steady but her face was not. The lines around her working eye had deepened. She looked, for the first time since Torvane had known her, old. Not the vigorous, sharp-tongued old of a woman who wielded age like a weapon. The tired old of someone carrying knowledge that was too heavy for one person.

"The Dominion didn't develop this technology, Torvane. They found it. Someone — or something — gave it to them. The mirror-portals were a sample. A demonstration. A taste of what the Gate can do when fully operational."

"And whatever gave it to them is on the other side of the Gate."

"Whatever gave it to them has been on the other side of the Gate for a thousand years. Pushing. Testing. Finding cracks in the seal and feeding power through them to anyone willing to use it." She met his eyes. "The Dominion thinks they're using the Gate. They're wrong. The Gate is using them."

Torvane looked at his detector. The blue-green pulse continued — steady, patient, relentless. A machine left running. A signal maintained for a millennium by something that did not experience time the way humans did.

"I need to tell Itzil," he said.

"Yes." Amalura gathered the scroll and her notes. "And Torvane — bring the detector. She needs to see the signal herself. She needs to understand what we're actually fighting."

They left the workshop together. The door closed behind them, and in the empty room, the salvaged portal fragments sat on the workbench in the fading light, their crystal surfaces catching the last rays of the day and scattering them in patterns that looked, if you watched long enough, almost intentional.

Almost like they were still trying to communicate with something that was listening.
