Chapter 17 - NIGHTSHADE'S LAMENT

The Dominion capital was beautiful in the way that prisons are beautiful — all symmetry and order and the absolute absence of anything that hadn't been approved.

Nightshade walked through the Palace of the Split Crown with the measured pace of a woman who understood that every corridor was watched, every conversation recorded, and every expression catalogued by functionaries whose only purpose was to ensure that the machinery of empire never stuttered. She walked this way not because she feared surveillance but because she respected it. Surveillance was a tool. She used tools. She didn't resent them for existing.

The palace was vast — a complex of black stone and silver filigree that sprawled across the highest hill in the capital like a crown on a skull. Its architecture was deliberately intimidating: vaulted ceilings that swallowed sound, corridors wide enough for cavalry, windows that admitted light but not warmth. It was a building designed to make people feel small, and it accomplished this with the ruthless efficiency that characterized everything the Dominion built.

She passed through the Hall of Oaths — a long gallery lined with the preserved ash-oath sigils of every enemy commander who had surrendered to the Dominion in the past fifty years. Hundreds of them, mounted in crystal frames, glowing with the faint crimson residue of erased wills. A trophy room. A warning. A reminder that the Dominion's power was not theoretical.

The throne room was at the heart of the palace. Not a throne, technically — Volzentar didn't sit on thrones. He stood. Always standing. It was a deliberate choice, a performance of readiness that communicated more than any crown or scepter: I am not resting. I am not waiting. I am acting. Always.

He was standing now, at the center of the room, reviewing reports on a table made of obsidian that reflected the torchlight like dark water. He was tall — not Gravok's mountainous height but a lean, precise tallness that suggested a blade standing on its edge. His face was angular, handsome in the severe way that hawks are handsome, with eyes the color of dark amber that never seemed to blink at the right intervals. There was something off about his timing — a fractional delay between stimulus and response that made conversations with him feel like speaking to someone who was hearing you from a great distance and choosing each reaction with deliberate care.

"Nightshade." He didn't look up from his reports. "Gravok is captured."

"Yes, my lord."

"The mirror-portals are destroyed."

"Yes, my lord."

"The siege of Aravalle has failed."

"Yes, my lord."

He set down the report and looked at her. The amber eyes were steady, calm, utterly without agitation. In a lesser man, this composure would have been a mask. In Volzentar, it was architecture — the visible surface of an internal structure so precisely engineered that emotion was not suppressed but channeled, directed, deployed only when it served a purpose.

"Tell me about the Sun-Blade bearer," he said.

Nightshade had prepared for this question. She'd spent the journey from the eastern front to the capital organizing her observations into a briefing that was precise, comprehensive, and honest. Volzentar valued honesty the way other rulers valued flattery — as a strategic asset, rare and therefore precious.

"She's young. Early twenties. Trained by Korvain at the mountaintop temple. She's growing into command faster than our projections anticipated — the siege accelerated her development. She held a breach alone for eleven minutes and led a counterattack that broke Gravok's formation." Nightshade paused. "She spared Gravok when she could have killed him. That wasn't mercy. It was strategy. She wanted his intelligence."

"And got it?"

"She interrogated him personally. Gravok talked. More than I would have predicted."

Volzentar's expression didn't change, but something shifted behind his eyes — a recalculation, an adjustment to an internal model. "Gravok has been loyal for twenty years. He talked because she asked?"

"She treated him with respect. Not kindness — respect. The distinction matters. Gravok has been a weapon his entire life. She treated him like a man. It confused him enough to lower his guard."

Volzentar was quiet for a moment. He turned and walked to the window — a massive opening in the obsidian wall that overlooked the capital. The city spread below, a grid of dark stone and silver light, organized and orderly and completely under control. A million people, living their lives within the structure the Dominion provided, grateful for the order, accepting the cost.

"Gravok was always a hammer," Volzentar said. His voice was reflective — not uncertain but contemplative, the tone of a man who thought in strategic epochs rather than tactical moments. "You don't use a hammer on a girl who fights like light. You use a mirror."

He turned back to Nightshade. "The portals are gone but the principle remains. She fights force with force and wins. She fights chaos with order and wins. The thing she hasn't been tested against is the thing she can't cut with a blade."

"Trust," Nightshade said.

"Trust. Loyalty. The bonds between her and her people. Those are her real weapons — not the Sun-Blade, not the tactical skill, not the growing legend. Her team. Break the team, and she breaks."

Nightshade had reached the same conclusion independently, which was why she'd been preparing for this conversation since the siege ended. "You want me to target her people."

"I want you to study her people. Find the pressure points. The fears. The guilts. The things they hide from each other and from themselves." He moved to the table and laid out a series of documents — intelligence reports, compiled by the Dominion's network of informants and spies. "Every person has a fracture line. The scout's guilt about his dead unit. The duelist's need for validation. The engineer's isolation. The healer's family in our custody. Find the fracture lines and apply pressure. Don't break them — stress them. Make them doubt each other. Make them doubt her."

"And the scout specifically?"

Volzentar's lips moved in something that was not quite a smile. "The scout is the key. He's the one she trusts most. The one she sends on the missions that matter. The one she reaches for when she's afraid." A pause. "He's also the one with the deepest fracture. Eleven dead scouts. A guilt so profound it shapes every decision he makes. If you can weaponize that guilt — turn it from a scar into an open wound — he'll become a liability she can't afford to keep and can't bring herself to release."

Nightshade looked at the intelligence reports. Personnel files. Movement records. Intercepted communications. The Dominion's intelligence apparatus was vast and thorough, and it had been watching Itzil's team since the first engagement.

She picked up Kaelen's file. The photograph was grainy — taken at distance by a field agent — but the face was clear. Sharp features. Pale grey-blue eyes. The expression of a man who was always calculating distances.

"The scout," she said.

"The scout." Volzentar returned to his reports. The conversation was over — not because he'd dismissed her but because he'd given her everything she needed and further words would be inefficient. "Begin phase two."

Nightshade took the files and left the throne room.

She walked through the corridors of the palace with the intelligence reports under her arm and the shape of a plan forming in her mind. It was not a plan that involved armies or sieges or the blunt instruments of conventional warfare. It was a plan that involved words — spoken at the right moment, to the right person, in the right tone. Words were her weapons. They always had been. Since the day she'd discovered that a well-placed sentence could accomplish what a hundred soldiers could not.

She'd been born in a border town — one of the first places the Dominion had conquered, back when the empire was young and its methods were still crude. She'd watched her parents choose sides. Her father had resisted. Her mother had collaborated. Her father had died on a wall. Her mother had risen through the Dominion's civilian administration to become a regional governor.

Nightshade had learned the lesson early: resistance was noble and fatal. Collaboration was ignoble and survivable. And the space between — the narrow, shadowed corridor where a person could serve the empire while steering it from within — was where the real power lived.

She'd risen through the Dominion's intelligence branch not by being the most ruthless or the most loyal but by being the most perceptive. She understood people. Not in the empathic, warm-hearted way that healers understood people. In the architectural way. She saw the structures inside them — the load-bearing beliefs, the stress fractures, the points where a carefully applied force would bring the whole edifice down.

It was a talent. It was also a curse. Understanding people meant seeing their pain with clarity that left no room for the comfortable fictions that most humans used to navigate the world. She saw the ash-oathed soldiers and understood that they were suffering. She saw the conquered populations and understood that their compliance was a survival strategy, not consent. She saw the Dominion's machinery of control and understood that it worked because it was built on a foundation of genuine need — people needed order, needed stability, needed the assurance that tomorrow would resemble today.

The Dominion provided those things. At a cost that Nightshade understood and accepted and sometimes, in the small hours of the morning, questioned.

But not today. Today there was work to do. A team to fracture. A woman to break by breaking the people she loved.

Nightshade returned to her quarters — a suite of rooms in the palace's intelligence wing, decorated with the sparse efficiency she preferred. She spread Kaelen's file on her desk and began to read.

The file was comprehensive. Family history: unknown, probably orphan or displaced. Military service: enlisted in the allied scouts at sixteen, assigned to the 7th Reconnaissance Unit. Service record: exemplary. Survival rate of unit: zero percent. Sole survivor: Kaelen. Cause of unit's destruction: Dominion ambush at Thornfield Pass. Intelligence assessment: the ambush was based on compromised patrol routes. Someone had given the Dominion the 7th Unit's schedule.

Nightshade paused.

She read the line again. Compromised patrol routes. She checked the source — a Dominion intelligence archive, cross-referenced with field reports from the eastern theater.

The 7th Reconnaissance Unit had been destroyed by an ambush that someone inside the allied command structure had made possible.

A traitor. Someone had betrayed Kaelen's unit. And no one had told him.

Nightshade closed the file. She sat in her chair and looked at the wall and thought about fracture lines and the application of precise, targeted pressure.

She had her weapon. Now she needed to decide when to use it.

She smiled. It was not a warm smile. It was the smile of a craftsman examining a perfect tool — admiring its design, appreciating its function, and knowing exactly where to apply it for maximum effect.

The scout's dead unit. Eleven ghosts. And a secret that would shatter the guilt he carried and replace it with something far more dangerous.

Rage.

Nightshade filed the intelligence report, extinguished her lamp, and went to sleep. She would need her rest. Phase two was going to be delicate work.
