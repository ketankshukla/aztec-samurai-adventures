Chapter 18 - THE INTERROGATION

The second interrogation began at dawn.

Itzil descended the stockade stairs with Amalura at her side, the old scholar carrying the sealed scroll from the Sealed Archive and the expression of a woman who was about to confirm something she desperately hoped was wrong. The guards nodded them through. The corridor smelled of damp stone and iron and the particular staleness of air that had been breathed too many times.

Gravok was awake. He was always awake when they came — sitting on his stone bench, chains slack, eyes tracking them from the moment the cell door opened. He'd been a prisoner for five days. The defiance had faded, replaced by something Itzil couldn't name. Not cooperation exactly. Resignation, perhaps. Or the particular exhaustion of a man who had run out of reasons to resist.

"I brought someone," Itzil said. "Amalura. She has questions I can't ask."

Gravok's eyes moved to Amalura. He studied her the way he studied everything — with the measuring gaze of a warrior assessing threat levels. Amalura returned the look with the unblinking directness of a woman who had been stared at by more intimidating things than captive beast commanders.

"You're the keeper," Gravok said. "The scholar. The one who reads the old texts."

"I am."

"Ask your questions."

Amalura sat on the wooden stool the guards provided. She placed the scroll on her lap, not unrolling it — holding it like an anchor, something to keep her steady in the current of what she was about to learn.

"The mirror-portal technology," she began. "Dalrignon built the network. But the underlying science — the spatial folding principles, the crystal resonance architecture — where did it come from?"

Gravok shrugged. The chains clinked. "Dalrignon found fragments. Old ruins. Underground sites that the empire's archaeologists uncovered during the expansion campaigns. He said the technology was ancient — predating the Dominion by centuries. He reverse-engineered what he found and improved it."

"Improved it how?"

"Made it smaller. Portable. The original technology was massive — structures the size of buildings, designed to create stable portals that lasted indefinitely. Dalrignon compressed the principles into something that could be built in months instead of decades."

Amalura's fingers tightened on the scroll. "The original structures. The ancient ones. Did Dalrignon say where they were?"

"Beneath the capital. Under the palace. The entire foundation of the Dominion's seat of power is built on top of something older." Gravok paused. "I've been in the deep levels. Once. When Volzentar took me to see the Weeping One. The corridors down there are different — the stone is wrong. Darker. Smoother. Cut by something that wasn't a human tool."

Amalura exchanged a look with Itzil. The look said: this confirms what we feared.

"The Weeping One," Amalura said. "Tell me about her."

Gravok's expression changed. The resignation cracked, and beneath it, something raw surfaced — not fear exactly, but the memory of fear. The scar tissue of an encounter that had healed on the surface and remained open beneath.

"She's in the deepest chamber. Below everything. Below the foundations, below the ancient ruins, below the level where even the archaeologists stop digging. Volzentar has a private staircase — carved stone, no torches. You carry your own light. The air gets cold as you go down. Not winter cold. Different. Like the heat has been drawn out of the air and stored somewhere else."

He paused. His hands, massive and scarred, were clasped in his lap. The knuckles were white.

"The chamber is dark. Completely dark. Even with a torch, the light doesn't reach the walls. It's like the dark is a substance — thick, heavy, pressing against you. And the sound. Before she speaks, you hear the crying. Not loud. Quiet. Constant. The sound of someone who has been weeping for so long they don't know how to stop."

"What does she look like?" Amalura asked.

"I don't know. The dark is too thick. You can feel her presence — something in the center of the chamber, sitting or standing or existing in a way that doesn't quite conform to either. She's... there. In the dark. And she knows you're there before you know she's there."

"What did she say to you?"

Gravok was quiet for a long time. The cell seemed smaller in the silence — the stone walls closer, the ceiling lower, the air heavier. When he spoke, his voice was different. Stripped of performance, stripped of the professional neutrality he'd maintained through two interrogations. Raw.

"She said my name. Then my mother's name. Then the name of every person I've killed — not the generals and commanders, the ones with titles. The first soldier I ever killed, in my first engagement, when I was seventeen. A boy from a border village who'd been conscripted three weeks earlier. She told me his name. She told me what he was thinking when I killed him. She told me he was thinking about his sister."

The cell was very quiet.

"Then she told me the future. Not in riddles or prophecies — in statements. Flat. Certain. Like reading a schedule. She said I would command the eastern army for nineteen years. She said I would win forty-six engagements and lose one. She said the one I lost would be against a woman with a blade of golden light who would spare my life when any rational commander would take it."

He looked at Itzil. His eyes were dark wells, and something at the bottom of them had been disturbed.

"She told me all of this seven years ago."

Amalura leaned forward. "Did she say anything about the Great Gate?"

"She said the Gate would open. Not if — when. She said the Seven would be gathered and the seal would break and the door would swing wide. She said Volzentar believed he could control what came through, and she said he was wrong, and she said she'd told him he was wrong, and he didn't listen because he was the kind of man who believed that anything could be controlled if you applied enough force and enough intelligence."

"And what did she say was on the other side?"

Gravok's hands tightened. The chains pulled taut. For a moment, he looked not like a beast commander or a prisoner or even a soldier, but like a man who had glimpsed something that exceeded the categories his mind used to organize reality.

"She said it was hungry. She said it had been hungry for a thousand years. She said the hunger was not for food or power or territory but for the thing that makes people people. The light inside. The awareness. The thing that looks out through our eyes and knows it exists." He paused. "She said it would eat us from the inside out, and we wouldn't even know it was happening until there was nothing left but shells walking around in our bodies, going through the motions of life without anyone home."

The temperature in the cell had dropped. Not physically — Itzil told herself it hadn't dropped physically. But the air felt colder, denser, as though Gravok's words had added weight to the atmosphere.

"One last thing," Amalura said. Her voice was steady. Her hands were not. "Did the Weeping One say anything about how to stop it?"

Gravok looked at her. The look carried everything he'd been carrying since that chamber seven years ago — the knowledge he'd buried, the certainty he'd smothered, the fear he'd converted into violence and command and the simple mechanics of obedience because the alternative was facing what he'd heard in the dark.

"She said the one who forges the blade a second time would unmake everything Volzentar has built. She said no one watches him. She said his name hasn't been spoken yet." He paused. "She was crying harder when she said it. Like it was the one thing that made her sad for reasons that weren't about suffering."

Amalura stood. The scroll was gripped in her hands so tightly the ancient parchment creaked.

"Thank you," she said to Gravok. The words were formal but the tone was not — it carried a recognition, an acknowledgment that what he'd shared had cost him something that couldn't be measured.

Gravok said nothing. He leaned back against the wall and closed his eyes. The audience was over.

In the corridor outside, Itzil and Amalura walked in silence. The guards saluted. The morning light filtered through the stockade's narrow windows, warm and ordinary and completely insufficient against the chill that had settled in Itzil's chest.

"The one who forges the blade a second time," Itzil said.

"Solkren," Amalura murmured. "The name hasn't been spoken yet in our story. But it will be. Book nine. The Forge of Souls." She caught herself. "I mean — the texts suggest a reforging. If the Sun-Blade is ever broken, the person who remakes it becomes something the Weeping One's intelligence fears."

They reached the stockade exit. The morning sun was bright and the camp was alive with the sounds of an army rebuilding. Soldiers drilling. Engineers hammering. The ordinary mechanics of survival continuing their rhythms regardless of what had been said in a stone cell by a man in chains.

"There's something else," Itzil said. She stopped walking. Amalura stopped beside her. "The captured Dominion officer. The one in the separate cell. The guards say he's been muttering."

Amalura's expression sharpened. "Muttering what?"

They walked to the secondary holding area. The officer was in a smaller cell — a mid-rank logistics coordinator captured during the siege, unremarkable except for what had happened to him in the three days since his capture.

He was sitting on the floor, rocking. His eyes were blank — not ash-oathed blank, but empty in a different way. Vacant. Staring at something that wasn't in the room. His lips moved continuously, shaping the same words over and over in a whisper that had the rhythm of a chant and the flatness of a recording.

Itzil leaned close to the bars. The whisper resolved into words.

"The Weeping One already knows you'll fail. The Weeping One already knows you'll fail. The Weeping One already knows you'll fail."

Over and over. Unceasing. A message delivered through a human vessel, transmitted across a continent by a mechanism that Itzil didn't understand, spoken by lips that moved without volition.

Amalura placed a hand on Itzil's shoulder. The grip was firm — steadying, anchoring.

"She knows we're coming," Amalura said quietly. "She's known since before we decided."

The officer continued to rock. The words continued to pour from his mouth like water from a broken pipe — steady, relentless, powered by something that didn't care about the vessel it was using.

Itzil stood at the bars and listened to the Weeping One's message, delivered through a man who had stopped being a person and become a telephone, and felt the war shift beneath her feet like tectonic plates moving in directions she couldn't predict and couldn't stop.

The sun climbed higher. The camp continued its work. The whisper continued in the cell.

And somewhere far to the south, in the dark beneath a palace built on ancient ruins, something wept and watched and waited with the patience of a thing that had already seen the ending.
