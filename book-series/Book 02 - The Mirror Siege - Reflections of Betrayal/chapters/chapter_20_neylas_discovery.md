Chapter 20 - NEYLA'S DISCOVERY

The prisoners were kept in the eastern wing of the stockade, separated from the command-level captives like Gravok by a corridor and two locked doors. There were forty-three of them — Dominion soldiers captured during the siege, most of them ash-oathed, all of them damaged in ways that Neyla's healing couldn't fully address because the damage wasn't physical.

She came every morning at dawn. She brought her kit — bandages, salves, the crystal vials of concentrated healing energy she'd learned to create during the weeks of war. She treated their wounds. She changed their dressings. She spoke to them in the soft, steady voice she used with all patients, the voice that said: I see you. You are a person. Whatever has been done to you, you are still here.

Most of them didn't respond. The ash-oath erased volition — the sigil burned into their chests overrode their will, replacing autonomous thought with obedience to whoever held the oath-bond. With their Dominion commanders dead or captured, the bond had no one to obey. The soldiers existed in a state of suspended purpose — bodies functioning, minds erased, waiting for orders that would never come.

They sat in their cells. They ate when food was placed in front of them. They breathed. They blinked. They were alive in every technical sense and absent in every meaningful one.

Neyla hated it. She hated it with a fury that she kept wrapped in professionalism and compassion, because fury without direction was just noise, and she'd spent her entire life learning to be more than noise.

Her family was ash-oathed. Her parents, her brother, her aunt. Taken during the Dominion's conquest of the border towns four years ago. She didn't know where they were. She didn't know if they were alive in any sense that mattered. Every ash-oathed soldier she treated was a mirror — a reflection of what had been done to the people she loved, a reminder of the thing she couldn't fix.

Until today.

The soldier's name was — had been — Corporal Tessen. Before the ash-oath, he'd been a farmer's son from a town called Millbrook. He'd been conscripted at eighteen, oathed at nineteen, and had spent three years as a weapon pointed at people who had never done him harm. The intelligence files recovered from the Dominion camp included his service record, and Neyla had read it the way she read all the files: searching for the person beneath the sigil.

She knelt beside his cot. He sat upright, eyes forward, breathing steady. The ash-oath sigil was visible on his chest — a crimson mark the size of a palm, etched into the skin with a precision that suggested the sorcerer who'd placed it had done this many times. The sigil pulsed faintly — not with the active glow of a commanded soldier but with the idle hum of a system on standby.

Neyla placed her hands on his chest, flanking the sigil. She'd done this before — a standard healing assessment, checking for physical damage beneath the magical brand. Her palms warmed. The turquoise-gold light of her healing magic bloomed between her fingers and sank into his skin, probing the tissue beneath.

Her magic touched the sigil.

Something happened.

The turquoise light met the crimson glow and the two energies — healing and binding — interacted in a way that Neyla had never experienced and hadn't anticipated. A spark. A resonance. The sigil flickered. For one heartbeat — one single, impossible heartbeat — the crimson light dimmed.

And Tessen's eyes cleared.

It was like watching a lamp relit in a dark room. The blankness receded. The vacancy filled. For a fraction of a second, Corporal Tessen of Millbrook was present — aware, conscious, alive in the way that mattered. His eyes focused on Neyla's face. His lips moved.

"Help," he whispered.

Then the sigil reasserted itself. The crimson glow flared. The blankness returned. Tessen's eyes went vacant, his lips stopped moving, and the moment was over.

Neyla sat back on her heels. Her hands were shaking. Her heart was hammering. The turquoise light faded from her palms, but the sensation remained — the electric awareness of two incompatible energies meeting and, for one heartbeat, one winning.

She had touched the ash-oath. And the ash-oath had flinched.

The implications cascaded through her mind with a speed that left her breathless. If her healing magic could interact with ash-oath sigils — if the turquoise energy could suppress the crimson, even momentarily — then the oaths were not absolute. They were not permanent. They were not unbreakable.

They were locks. And she had just found the shape of the key.

She spent the next three hours experimenting. Carefully, methodically, with the disciplined patience of a healer who understood that reckless hope was as dangerous as no hope at all. She placed her hands on Tessen's sigil again and again, varying the intensity of her magic, the duration of contact, the emotional state she brought to the interaction.

The results were consistent. Every time her healing magic touched the sigil, the crimson light flickered. The duration of the suppression varied — from a fraction of a second to nearly two seconds at maximum effort. Each suppression was accompanied by a flash of awareness in Tessen's eyes, a momentary return of the person beneath the oath.

But she couldn't break it. The sigil was too strong — a construct of dark energy reinforced by years of magical infrastructure, maintained by a network of sorcerers and powered by the captured life-force of its own victims. Her magic could suppress it. It couldn't overcome it. The gap between suppression and liberation was vast — the difference between holding a door open for a second and tearing it off its hinges.

She needed more power. More focus. A deeper understanding of how the sigil worked and how her magic interfered with it. She needed time she didn't have and resources she couldn't access and knowledge that might not exist.

But the possibility was real. The key existed. It just needed to be forged.

She found Itzil in the command tent, reviewing reports with Kaelen. They both looked up when she entered — Itzil with the reflexive alertness of a commander, Kaelen with the sharp assessment of a scout.

"I touched an ash-oath," Neyla said. No preamble. No softening. The discovery was too big for diplomatic packaging. "My healing magic interacted with the sigil. It suppressed the oath for two seconds. The soldier regained consciousness."

The silence that followed was the charged kind — the silence of people whose understanding of the world had just shifted.

"Two seconds," Itzil said.

"Two seconds. At maximum effort. The sigil is strong — stronger than anything my magic has encountered. But it responded to the healing energy. It flinched." Neyla's voice was steady but her eyes were bright with the particular intensity of a person who had spent years searching for a crack in an unbreakable wall and had just found one. "If I can learn to sustain the suppression — if I can increase the power and duration — I might be able to break ash-oaths."

"If you could break ash-oaths," Itzil said slowly, her mind visibly running the strategic implications, "we could free every enslaved soldier. The Dominion's army would collapse. Half their fighting force is ash-oathed. If those soldiers regained their will—"

"They'd stop fighting. Or they'd turn on their captors." Kaelen's voice was quiet but carrying the particular weight it acquired when tactical possibilities aligned with moral imperatives. "The entire Dominion war machine depends on ash-oath slavery. Break the oaths, and the machine stops."

"I said maybe," Neyla said. Because she was a healer, and healers didn't promise what they couldn't deliver. "I said more power. More focus. I'm not there yet. What I have is a crack. Not a solution."

"A crack is a start," Itzil said. She stood and placed both hands on the table, leaning forward with the intensity she brought to everything that mattered. "What do you need?"

"Time. Access to the prisoners for continued study. Amalura's texts on ash-oath construction — the more I understand about how the sigils work, the better I can target my interference. And—" She hesitated. "Practice. Real practice, with real sigils. Which means working with the prisoners every day, touching the thing that enslaved them, feeling the resistance and pushing against it."

"The ethical implications—"

"Are significant. I know. Every time I suppress the sigil, the soldier experiences a moment of consciousness — a moment of awareness that they're trapped, that their will has been stolen, that the body they're in is not under their control. That awareness is painful. I'm asking to inflict temporary pain for the possibility of permanent liberation."

Itzil looked at her. Neyla met the look. Between them, an understanding passed — the kind that existed between people who had both seen suffering and both decided that doing something about it was worth the cost.

"Do it," Itzil said. "Whatever you need. Amalura's texts, access to the prisoners, time. But Neyla — be careful with yourself. You're reaching into the Dominion's darkest magic. That kind of contact has a cost."

Neyla nodded. She knew the cost. She'd been paying it since the day her family was taken — the quiet, grinding cost of compassion in a world that rewarded cruelty, the daily expenditure of hope against evidence, the stubborn refusal to accept that some locks had no keys.

She had a key now. Incomplete, imperfect, barely functional. But real.

She left the command tent and walked back to the stockade. The morning sun was warm on her face. The camp was alive with the sounds of recovery — hammers, voices, the ordinary mechanics of survival.

In the eastern wing, Corporal Tessen sat on his cot, eyes blank, breathing steady, waiting for orders that would never come.

Neyla sat beside him. She placed her hands on the sigil. The turquoise light bloomed.

"I'm going to find you," she whispered. "All of you. Every person the Dominion has erased. I'm going to find the key and I'm going to turn it and I'm going to bring you home."

The sigil flickered. For two seconds, Tessen's eyes cleared.

For two seconds, he saw her. And she saw him.

It was enough. For now, it was enough.
