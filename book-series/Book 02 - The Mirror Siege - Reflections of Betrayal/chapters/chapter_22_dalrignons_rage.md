Chapter 22 - DALRIGNON'S RAGE

The workshop beneath the eastern fortress had not seen daylight in three weeks, and Dalrignon preferred it that way.

Light was a distraction. Sunlight especially — chaotic, variable, subject to the whims of weather and rotation and all the other uncontrollable factors that made the natural world so profoundly irritating. His phosphorescent crystals provided constant, even illumination at precisely the wavelength his eyes preferred. No shadows. No fluctuation. No surprises.

Surprises were for lesser minds. Dalrignon's mind operated on predictions, and predictions required control, and control required an environment stripped of variables. The workshop was his controlled environment — a stone chamber sixty feet below the surface, insulated from sound and vibration and the emotional noise of the thousands of humans who lived and fought and died above his head without understanding any of the forces that actually shaped their world.

The blueprints covered every surface. Walls, floor, workbenches, the inside of the door — every flat plane had been claimed by the expanding architecture of his new design. Not mirror-portals. Those were finished. Destroyed, yes, but also finished in the creative sense — he'd solved that problem, built the solution, and watched it work until a scout with a blade and an old woman with a knife had smashed it.

He would rebuild the portals. Of course he would. The improved design — six distributed anchors instead of one — was already complete. Volzentar had authorized the ash-oath reserves as a power source. Construction would begin within the week. But the portals were a footnote. A tactical tool. A footnote in the margins of his real work.

The Great Gate.

He had been reading the ancient texts for fourteen days straight, sleeping in two-hour intervals, eating only when his hands shook too badly to hold a pen. The texts were written in the angular script of the original builders — a civilization so old that their name had been forgotten and only their engineering remained. The language was complex but logical, and Dalrignon had cracked it years ago. What he hadn't cracked — what he was cracking now, hour by hour, equation by equation — was the mathematics.

The original Gate was a masterwork. The spatial folding principles that underpinned it were orders of magnitude more sophisticated than anything he'd built. His mirror-portals were crude approximations — the equivalent of a child's drawing compared to the original painting. The Gate didn't fold space. It dissolved the barrier between dimensions, creating a stable aperture that could theoretically remain open indefinitely.

The key word was "theoretically." The original builders had sealed the Gate because they couldn't control the aperture. Once opened, the dimensional boundary became permeable in both directions, and what came through from the other side was not what they'd expected or wanted. They'd sealed it in haste, using the seven relics as locking mechanisms — each one a component of a multidimensional seal that required all seven to be in place for the barrier to hold.

Remove the relics, and the seal weakened. Remove all seven, provide sufficient energy to force the aperture, and the Gate would open.

Simple in principle. Devastating in execution.

Dalrignon's task was not to open the Gate. Anyone with the relics and enough power could do that — it was a mechanical process, no different from turning a key in a lock. His task was to ensure that the Gate, once opened, could be controlled. Directed. Used as a channel rather than a flood — allowing specific things through while keeping everything else out.

The ancient texts suggested this was impossible. The original builders had tried and failed. The dimensional boundary, once dissolved, could not be selectively maintained. It was all or nothing. Open or closed.

Dalrignon did not accept impossibilities. He redesigned them.

The new blueprints showed a framework — a structure to be built around the existing Gate, incorporating principles from his mirror-portal technology and the original builders' dimensional mathematics. A filter. A valve. A mechanism that would sit at the aperture and regulate the flow of energy and matter between dimensions, allowing Volzentar to access the power of the Realm Beyond the Veil without opening the floodgates.

It was, without question, the most ambitious engineering project in human history. It was also, without question, the most dangerous. If the filter failed — if even one component malfunctioned, if one calculation was wrong by one decimal point — the Gate would open without constraint, and everything on the other side would pour through.

Dalrignon understood the risk. He had calculated it. The probability of filter failure was 2.7 percent — low enough to proceed, high enough to warrant concern.

He was not concerned. He was excited.

The excitement was the thing that separated him from the other engineers the Dominion employed — the competent, careful, fundamentally limited minds that built siege weapons and fortifications and all the other tools of conventional warfare. They built to specification. Dalrignon built to the edge of possibility and then pushed past it. The mirror-portals had been a step. The Great Gate filter would be a leap. And what came after — the things he would build once he had access to the dimensional energy of the Realm Beyond the Veil — would be a revolution.

He didn't think about what was on the other side. Not in the way Gravok thought about it — with fear and superstition and the primitive instinct that something bigger and hungrier than humanity was waiting in the dark. Dalrignon thought about it in terms of energy. The Realm Beyond the Veil was a dimension in advanced entropic decay — a dying universe whose remaining energy was concentrated in a single intelligence. That intelligence was vast, patient, and powerful, but it was also — from an engineering perspective — a resource. A battery. A power source of a magnitude that made everything the Dominion currently used look like candles in a cathedral.

If the intelligence could be controlled — channeled, directed, contained — then its energy could be used. To power portals that spanned continents. To forge weapons that could reshape geography. To build an empire that would last not centuries but millennia.

If it couldn't be controlled, the world would end. But Dalrignon had run the numbers. 2.7 percent.

He returned to his blueprints. The pen moved with the confident, precise strokes of a mind that had never encountered a problem it couldn't reduce to mathematics and had no reason to believe this problem would be the exception.

On his desk, beside the blueprints and the ancient texts and the scattered tools of his trade, a sealed scroll bore Volzentar's orders:

BUILD THE FILTER. THE GATE OPENS IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS.

Dalrignon smiled. It was not a warm smile. It was the smile of a man who had been given permission to do the one thing he'd been born to do, and nothing — not scouts, not old women with knives, not the concerned whispers of a weeping seer in the dark — was going to stop him.

He worked through the night. The phosphorescent crystals glowed. The pen scratched. The equations accumulated.

And beneath the floor of the workshop, beneath the fortress, beneath the capital itself, the ancient technology of the original builders hummed in its millennium-long vigil — patient, steady, waiting.

The Gate was sealed. But the seal was cracking. And the man who would build the mechanism to control what came through was working faster than he'd ever worked before, driven by genius and ambition and the absolute, unshakeable conviction that anything could be controlled if you understood it well enough.

The texts of the original builders, who had understood it better than anyone, were stacked on his desk. They had sealed the Gate in terror. They had destroyed their own records. They had built entire traditions devoted to ensuring the Gate stayed closed.

Dalrignon had read their warnings. He had noted their fears. He had catalogued their failures.

And then he had written two words on a fresh sheet of vellum:

BUILD FASTER.

The night deepened. The pen moved. The mathematics grew.

And somewhere beyond the dimensional barrier, something that had been waiting for a thousand years felt the first tremor of a seal beginning to give way, and its hunger — vast, patient, and older than stars — intensified by one imperceptible degree.
