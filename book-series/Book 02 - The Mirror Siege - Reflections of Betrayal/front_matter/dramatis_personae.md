# Dramatis Personae

## The Heroes

**ITZIL** — Commander. Bearer of the Sun-Blade. Growing into leadership with every battle, still carrying the weight of doubt like armor she can't remove.

**KAELEN** — Scout. The last survivor of a wiped-out reconnaissance unit. Fast, sharp-tongued, haunted by guilt — and the only one willing to go behind enemy lines alone.

**JAGREN** — Duelist. A flashy arena fighter learning that glory has a price. His blade is fast; his heart is catching up.

**TORVANE** — Engineer. A quiet inventor who sees the world in systems and solutions. His mind may be the most dangerous weapon in the alliance.

**NEYLA** — Healer. A compassionate woman whose family was enslaved by ash-oaths. Her healing magic is beginning to touch things no one thought possible.

**MIYAKO** — Exile Sensei. A former Sun-Blade master from the shadow school tradition, hiding in occupied territory for decades. She carries regret like a blade — and she's done running from it.

## The Elders

**KORVAIN** — The Last Grandmaster. Itzil's mentor. Seventy-three years old, still the finest swordsman alive. His body is failing but his mind is iron.

**AMALURA** — The Keeper of Lore. Ancient scholar of the Sun-Blade tradition. Sharp-tongued, brilliant, sees what others miss.

## The Dominion

**VOLZENTAR** — The Warlord. Supreme commander of the Dominion. Charismatic, theatrical, terrifyingly intelligent. He doesn't react to setbacks — he plans for them.

**NIGHTSHADE** — The Blood Orator. Volzentar's most dangerous operative. She doesn't fight with blades — she fights with words, and the people who listen don't come back.

**GRAVOK** — The Beast Commander. A mountain of a man who commands an army of war-beasts. Brutal, direct, relentless — and now a prisoner of war.

**DALRIGNON** — The Portal Engineer. A brilliant, amoral engineer who builds mirror-portals powered by human souls. He sees atrocity as innovation.

## The World

**THE SUN-BLADE** — A weapon of pure sunlight, manifested by the will of its bearer. The only weapon that can break the Dominion's dark magic.

**THE GREAT GATE** — An ancient portal sealed centuries ago. The Dominion seeks to reopen it. The mirror-portal technology is a fragment of its design.

**ASH-OATHS** — Dark magic that enslaves by burning a sigil into the victim's chest, erasing their will while leaving their body functional.

**MIRROR-PORTALS** — Shimmering doorways that allow instant travel across vast distances. Powered by crystallized human souls. Destroyed in this book — but the technology endures.

**THE WEEPING ONE (SERENTHAR)** — A demon-bound seer imprisoned beneath the Dominion palace. She weeps because she sees everything — past, present, and future — and cannot look away.

**THE DOMINION** — A vast empire ruled by Volzentar, built on conquest, ash-oath slavery, and the promise of order through control.
