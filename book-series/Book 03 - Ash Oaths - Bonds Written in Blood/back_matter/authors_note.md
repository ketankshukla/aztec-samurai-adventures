# Author's Note

Thank you for reading *Ash Oaths*.

This book was about words — and whether they can be weapons, shields, or bridges depending on who wields them.

Zariel's journey is the story of a man who discovers that diplomacy is not performance. The golden tongue, the charming smile, the perfectly calibrated argument — these are tools. But the moment that changes the summit isn't a tool. It's a wound. When Zariel stands before five nations and chooses the world over his sister, he's not performing. He's bleeding. And that blood — that raw, unscripted honesty — is more persuasive than anything the most skilled diplomat could construct.

Pearlvaine is the mirror. She's brilliant, principled in her own way, and genuinely believes the Dominion offers the best future. She's not wrong about the chaos of freedom — the world is messy, violent, and full of people making terrible choices. Where she's wrong is in the conclusion: that the cure for bad choices is no choices at all.

Helisar is the nightmare. Not because he's cruel — because he's kind. The most dangerous villain isn't the one who hurts you and knows it. It's the one who hurts you and thinks they're helping. Helisar believes every word he says. That's what makes him terrifying.

And Neyla's discovery — that healing magic can break ash-oaths — changes the war from a contest of armies to a contest of liberation. Every person freed is a victory. Every oath broken is a blow against the Gate. The war isn't just about who has the biggest army. It's about who can save the most people.

Book 4 takes us to Fortress Ashfall — where the battle that began at the end of this book will test everything the alliance has built. Jagren's story comes to the foreground. The cost of war becomes personal. And Volzentar steps out of the shadows.

I hope you'll continue the journey.

With gratitude,
Ketan Shukla
