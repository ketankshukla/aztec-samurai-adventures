# Book Description — Aztec Samurai Adventures Book 3: Ash Oaths - Bonds Written in Blood

## Subtitle: Bonds Written in Blood

---

<b>The war moves from battlefields to ballrooms — and the most dangerous weapon is a lie that sounds like the truth.</b>

<p>When five neutral nations gather for a summit that will determine the fate of the continent, the alliance sends its best weapon: Zariel den Morath, a diplomat whose golden tongue has never met an argument it couldn't win. His opponent is Pearlvaine, the Dominion's demon-bonded negotiator, who can make any truth sound like whatever you want to hear.</p>

<p>The summit is a chess match. Pearlvaine offers peace. Zariel offers war. And the neutral nations are leaning toward the woman who promises safety — because safety is the easiest thing in the world to sell.</p>

<p><b>In this book:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>A diplomat-spymaster faces the most dangerous negotiator alive in a duel of words that will determine whether five nations fight or kneel</li>
<li>The Fallen Saint is revealed — a gentle, kind-eyed man who runs an ash-oath factory and genuinely believes he's saving people from the burden of free will</li>
<li>A healer breaks her first complete ash-oath, liberating a farmer who remembers every moment of his enslavement</li>
<li>A brother chooses the world over his sister — and trusts strangers to bring her home</li>
<li>The true nature of ash-oaths is decoded: they don't just enslave — they feed the Great Gate, converting human consciousness into fuel for a door that should never open</li>
<li>A spy is uncovered, a trap is revealed, and the alliance marches into the jaws of Fortress Ashfall with open eyes</li>
</ul>

<p>Ash Oaths is the third book in an epic fantasy series that combines the warrior traditions of Mesoamerica with the disciplined philosophy of the samurai. The words have been spoken. The oaths have been written. And the bonds — of blood, of loyalty, of the stubborn refusal to let the world stay broken — are about to be tested.</p>

<p>For fans of <i>The Poppy War</i>, <i>The Blade Itself</i>, and <i>The Name of the Wind</i> — a series where the deadliest battles are fought not with swords but with words, and the highest price is paid not in blood but in trust.</p>

<p><i>The gates of Ashfall are open. The trap is set. And the alliance walks in knowing.</i></p>

<p><b>Book 3 of 12 in the <i>Aztec Samurai Adventures</i> series. From Ketan Shukla, published by Metronagon.</b></p>
