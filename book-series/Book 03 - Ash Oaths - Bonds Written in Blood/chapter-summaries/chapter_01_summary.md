# Chapter 1 Summary — THE GOLDEN TONGUE

**POV:** Zariel

Zariel den Morath, diplomat-spymaster, is introduced at the Free City of Veranthos where he has been engineering a Grand Summit of five neutral nations for six weeks. He receives Itzil's message requesting his services and replies that he'll come after "setting the table." He prepares for the summit by studying dossiers on each nation and working back-channels.

His assistant Delara reports that the Dominion's negotiator has arrived: Pearlvaine, a demon-bonded diplomat with enhanced persuasion. Zariel recognizes her as the most dangerous opponent he's ever faced — she can make any truth sound like what the listener wants to hear.

**Key Events:** Zariel introduced, summit preparations, five neutral nations described, Pearlvaine's arrival confirmed.

**Cliffhanger:** Pearlvaine and Zariel lock eyes across the Hall of Balanced Scales — two master diplomats acknowledging each other before the game begins.
