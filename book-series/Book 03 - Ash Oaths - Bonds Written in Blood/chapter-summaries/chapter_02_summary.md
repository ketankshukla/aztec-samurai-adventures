# Chapter 2 Summary — THE DEMON DIPLOMAT

**POV:** Pearlvaine (Villain)

Pearlvaine's backstory and philosophy are revealed. She grew up in the aftermath of the Southern Collapse — a civil war that destroyed four nations. She joined the Dominion's diplomatic corps at nineteen and received the demon-bond at twenty-five. She genuinely believes the Dominion offers the best future: order over chaos, safety over freedom.

She prepares her strategy: the Autonomy Accord, offering neutral nations sovereignty in exchange for non-interference. She reviews Zariel's file and recognizes him as possibly better than her in raw skill. Her advantage: she can offer peace while he can only offer war.

She rehearses her opening speech. The demon beneath her skin pulses with approval. In the mirror, her reflection's smile lingers a heartbeat longer than her own.

**Key Events:** Pearlvaine's backstory revealed, demon-bond explained, autonomy accord strategy prepared, Zariel assessed as formidable opponent.

**Cliffhanger:** The mirror reflects the demon's smile differently — ancient, knowing, pleased.
