# Chapter 3 Summary — THE GRAND SUMMIT

**POV:** Zariel

The Grand Summit opens at the Hall of Balanced Scales. All five neutral nation delegations arrive: King Aldric (Thalendor), Commander Sethara (Pyrrath), Chief Minister Orvaine (Coravel), Elder Maeven (Sunhaven), and Queen Thessaly (Ashenmere). Zariel assesses each leader's disposition.

Zariel delivers his opening speech — warning about the Dominion's mirror-portal technology, the Great Gate, and the inevitability of Dominion expansion. Pearlvaine counters with the Autonomy Accord, offering peace, sovereignty, and the assurance that the war will pass neutral nations by. Her speech is devastatingly effective.

Zariel realizes he is losing. The middle ground — Coravel, Sunhaven, Ashenmere — is shifting toward Pearlvaine. He sends an urgent message to Itzil requesting a witness: someone freed from an ash-oath who can testify about what "autonomy" really means.

**Key Events:** Summit opens, both sides present arguments, Pearlvaine's peace offer gains traction, Zariel requests a witness from Itzil.

**Cliffhanger:** Itzil's reply arrives: UNDERSTOOD. WORKING ON IT. HOLD THE LINE.
