# Chapter 4 Summary — ZARIEL'S GAMBIT

**POV:** Zariel

Zariel works the margins of the summit on day two, meeting each delegation privately. He warns King Aldric about mirror-portal technology that renders mountain defenses obsolete. He presents economic data to Chief Minister Orvaine showing how Dominion ash-oath labor undercuts Coravel's trade. He tells Elder Maeven the true story of a farmer named Edren who was ash-oathed and used as a power source for the mirror-portal network.

Despite progress with Thalendor and Pyrrath, the middle ground continues to drift toward Pearlvaine. Zariel receives Itzil's message: a strike team is heading to Helisar's sanctuary at Gracehold — an ash-oath factory disguised as a healing center. Extraction in four days.

Zariel must stall the summit for four days while Pearlvaine works the margins with demon-enhanced charm.

**Key Events:** Zariel lobbies each delegation individually, makes progress with Thalendor/Pyrrath, Coravel remains undecided, Itzil confirms Gracehold strike.

**Cliffhanger:** Four days to hold the line with words alone against the best negotiator in the world.
