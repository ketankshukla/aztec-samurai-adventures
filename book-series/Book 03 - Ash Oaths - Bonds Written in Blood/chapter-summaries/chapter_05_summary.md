# Chapter 5 Summary — THE FALLEN SAINT

**POV:** Itzil

Itzil leads a four-person strike team (Kaelen, Jagren, Neyla) to Gracehold, a Dominion-controlled town run by Helisar. The town is eerily beautiful — white stone, wildflower-lined roads, a central cathedral. The residents appear content but blank, their inner lives smoothed flat by ash-oaths.

Neyla senses the truth: every person in Gracehold is slowly dying, their life-force being drained by active ash-oaths. Helisar greets them warmly — genuinely kind, gentle, and utterly monstrous. He believes he is saving people from the burden of free will. He argues that choice is the disease, not the cure.

Kaelen identifies a potential extraction target: a young man named Corwen whose hands twitch — the last remnant of a will that refuses to die. The team decides to stay the night and attempt liberation after dark.

**Key Events:** Gracehold and Helisar introduced, ash-oath town revealed, Neyla detects life-force draining, Corwen identified as rescue target.

**Cliffhanger:** Itzil tells her team: "Tonight. We save one person. And then that person saves five nations."
