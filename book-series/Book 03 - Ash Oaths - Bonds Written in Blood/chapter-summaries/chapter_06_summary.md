# Chapter 6 Summary — THE SAINT'S MASK

**POV:** Itzil

Helisar discovers the team at midnight in the east wing where Neyla is working on Corwen. He confronts Itzil philosophically — arguing that choice is the mechanism by which humans destroy themselves and that the ash-oath removes the burden of freedom. Itzil counters that mercy that isn't chosen isn't mercy — it's control.

Itzil gambles: she asks Helisar to let them free one person as a test. If Corwen is miserable, it proves Helisar's point. Helisar agrees, confident the freed person will beg to return.

Neyla works through the night, breaking the ash-oath layer by layer. At dawn, the final layer cracks. Corwen screams back to consciousness — raw, human awareness flooding back. He remembers everything: the ritual, the erasure, the months of captivity. His wife Lira is still inside.

**Key Events:** Helisar-Itzil philosophical confrontation, Helisar permits one liberation, Neyla breaks Corwen's ash-oath through the night, Corwen freed at dawn.

**Cliffhanger:** Helisar watches from the nave: "They'll understand. Eventually, they always understand."
