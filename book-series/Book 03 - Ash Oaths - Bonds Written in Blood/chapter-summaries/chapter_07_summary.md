# Chapter 7 Summary — THE LIBERATION

**POV:** Neyla

Neyla supports Corwen as the team evacuates through the cathedral at dawn. Corwen's motor control is reconnecting slowly — his body relearning voluntary motion after months of automated obedience. The team moves through the main gate during the guard rotation gap that Kaelen timed precisely.

Neyla reflects on the significance of her breakthrough: the ash-oath breaking technique is repeatable but slow — hours per person. Against thousands of ash-oathed souls, the math is crushing. She resolves to train others and build a corps of oath-breakers who can work in parallel.

Corwen sees the sleeping congregation as they pass and reveals his wife Lira is still inside. Itzil vows to return. The team escapes Gracehold and heads toward the allied lines and the summit.

**Key Events:** Team evacuates Gracehold with Corwen, Neyla reflects on scalability of oath-breaking, Corwen reveals his wife remains ash-oathed, escape successful.

**Cliffhanger:** Corwen watches the horizon, burning with the need to make his freedom mean something.
