# Chapter 8 Summary — THE ESCAPE FROM GRACEHOLD

**POV:** Kaelen

Alarms sound two miles downriver — Helisar has activated the cathedral's central sigil, sending ash-oath soldiers in pursuit. Corwen explains the soldiers are tireless and relentless. Kaelen navigates the team from the Clearwater River to the wider Ashrun River to outpace pursuit.

Twelve ash-oath soldiers catch up at a narrow point in the river. Neyla insists on non-lethal engagement — the soldiers are victims, not enemies. Jagren agrees to restraint. Itzil uses the Sun-Blade's light pulse to disrupt the soldiers' sigils for three seconds, allowing the boat to shoot through the narrows.

The team crosses the border into allied territory by noon. Corwen watches the soldiers left behind on the bank and grieves — his wife is still inside Gracehold. Neyla takes his hand in silent solidarity.

**Key Events:** Pursuit by ash-oath soldiers, river escape, Sun-Blade disruption technique used, non-lethal engagement principle established, border crossing.

**Cliffhanger:** Corwen rehearses the words he will say to five nations about what it means to lose your name and find it again.
