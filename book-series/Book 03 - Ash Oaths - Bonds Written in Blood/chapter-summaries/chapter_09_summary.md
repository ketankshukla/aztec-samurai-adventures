# Chapter 9 Summary — THE TESTIMONY

**POV:** Zariel

Zariel has been stalling the summit for four days using procedural delays. Pearlvaine uses the recesses to deepen relationships with delegations. Sunhaven requests a vote for the next day — Zariel is out of time.

Itzil's message arrives: Corwen is en route. The team arrives at Veranthos harbor the next morning. Zariel meets Corwen — a farmer with calloused hands and a story the world needs to hear.

Corwen testifies before the full assembly. He describes the ash-oath process: volunteering for "community service," the ritual, months of conscious paralysis inside his own body, watching himself obey orders while unable to close his eyes. His wife Lira is still inside Gracehold. The testimony devastates the hall.

Coravel withdraws from the Autonomy Accord. Pyrrath and Thalendor formally commit. Elder Maeven weeps. Pearlvaine's accord collapses. She requests a recess.

**Key Events:** Corwen arrives at Veranthos, testifies before the summit, the Autonomy Accord collapses, three nations shift toward the alliance, Pearlvaine defeated by raw truth.

**Cliffhanger:** Zariel sits in the garden and allows himself to breathe — the summit is shifting, the alliance is growing.
