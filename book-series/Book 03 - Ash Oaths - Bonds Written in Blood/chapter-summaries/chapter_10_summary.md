# Chapter 10 Summary — PEARLVAINE'S PIVOT

**POV:** Pearlvaine (Villain)

Pearlvaine reports the summit's collapse to the Dominion via blood-mirror. She receives contingency authorization: Code Vermillion — use Zariel's sister Essara as a hostage. Trade his withdrawal for her safe return.

Pearlvaine feels the demon push her toward the manipulation. She recognizes this as crude — the kind of tactic Gravok would use. She despises its inelegance but follows orders. She respects Zariel and hates that she must destroy him through personal leverage rather than professional skill.

She delivers a message to Zariel and meets him in the garden behind the Hall of Balanced Scales. She shows him a viewing glass with his sister's image — Essara, thin and scared but alive in a Dominion facility. She offers the trade: his silence for her life.

**Key Events:** Pearlvaine receives hostage orders, internal conflict about the tactic's crudeness, confronts Zariel with Essara's image, offers the trade.

**Cliffhanger:** Zariel asks for one day to decide. Pearlvaine walks away through the fog. The demon smiles with her face.
