# Chapter 11 Summary — THE SISTER

**POV:** Zariel

Zariel spends a sleepless night staring at the viewing glass showing Essara's face. He wrestles with the impossible choice: five nations or one person. He messages Korvain, who asks: "What would you tell Essara to do if the roles were reversed?"

The answer is clear — Essara would say "Don't you dare." She would refuse to be a bargaining chip. Zariel decides to turn Pearlvaine's weapon against her. He prepares not a withdrawal speech but a speech that will expose the hostage tactic to the full assembly.

At the summit, he reveals Essara's capture and the trade offer. He exposes the Dominion's methods — when their accord fails, they kidnap. He announces he will not withdraw, choosing the alliance over his sister's safety because Essara would want him to. He asks Itzil to rescue her.

All five nations respond: Thalendor, Pyrrath, and Coravel formally commit military and financial support. Sunhaven offers humanitarian aid. Ashenmere offers border defense and intelligence sharing. Pearlvaine exits the hall in defeat.

**Key Events:** Zariel's sleepless night, Korvain's advice, Zariel exposes hostage tactic at summit, all five nations commit in varying degrees, Itzil promises rescue.

**Cliffhanger:** Zariel puts the viewing glass in his pocket beside his heart — trusting strangers to save the person he loves most.
