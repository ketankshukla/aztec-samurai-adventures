# Chapter 12 Summary — ZARIEL'S CHOICE

**POV:** Zariel

The morning after the vote, Veranthos transforms into a military logistics hub. Zariel watches the rescue team depart for Facility Twelve. He begins building the alliance's operational structure — meeting with Thalendor's military attaché (5,000 infantry), Pyrrath's commander (3,000 cavalry + scouts), and Coravel's trade council (200,000 gold war fund).

Queen Thessaly of Ashenmere requests a private meeting. She reveals she is willing to increase her commitment: the Deepwood intelligence network — a legendary surveillance system covering Ashenmere's vast forests — will share all surveillance data with the alliance. In exchange, she demands guaranteed sovereignty post-war.

As a final gesture, Thessaly provides a full intelligence packet on Facility Twelve — maps, guard rotations, ward placements, and a note about an unguarded drainage grate on the south wall. Zariel sends the intelligence to the rescue team.

**Key Events:** Alliance logistics begin, military commitments detailed, Thessaly upgrades to intelligence sharing, provides Facility Twelve intel for Essara's rescue.

**Cliffhanger:** Zariel sends the intelligence to Itzil with one word: HURRY.
