# Chapter 13 Summary — THE RESCUE PLAN

**POV:** Kaelen

Kaelen plans the rescue of Essara from Facility Twelve using Thessaly's intelligence packet. The team (Kaelen, Miyako, Jagren, Neyla) operates from a fisherman's cottage three miles north of the facility.

The plan has three phases: (1) Jagren's diversion — flash charges at the north gate to draw guards; (2) Kaelen and Miyako infiltrate through a drainage grate on the south wall, navigate a partially collapsed tunnel, and shadow-step through the interior to Essara's cell in Block C; (3) extraction through the tunnel to Neyla's waiting horse-cart.

Miyako identifies the tunnel as the plan's vulnerability — if it's more collapsed than intelligence suggests, there's no backup route. Itzil briefs via mirror-relay from Veranthos and orders Neyla to wait 45 minutes maximum at the rendezvous.

**Key Events:** Rescue plan detailed, team roles assigned, Miyako identifies tunnel risk, Itzil provides final authorization.

**Cliffhanger:** Midnight is coming. Essara doesn't know four people have memorized her cell number and guard rotation.
