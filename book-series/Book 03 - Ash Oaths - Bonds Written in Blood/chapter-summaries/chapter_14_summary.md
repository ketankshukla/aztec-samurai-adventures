# Chapter 14 Summary — THE INFILTRATION

**POV:** Kaelen

Kaelen and Miyako infiltrate Facility Twelve at midnight. They enter through the drainage grate on the south wall during the ward-disruptor window (10 minutes). The tunnel is 200 feet long, partially collapsed — Kaelen barely fits through a two-foot gap in the rubble. Miyako follows more easily.

They emerge into the maintenance corridor and shadow-step through the facility in synchronized bursts — 20 seconds invisible, 10 seconds in cover. They navigate past ash-oath guard patrols on three-minute rotations and reach Block C, third floor, eastern wing.

Essara is awake and prepared. She's been exercising daily in her cell, anticipating rescue. She's sharp, resourceful, and immediately cooperative. Jagren's flash charges detonate at the north gate — the diversion draws all guards to the front. The team reverses course through the corridors and tunnel.

Essara crawls through the collapsed section without hesitation. They emerge from the drainage grate into moonlight. Neyla is waiting with the horse-cart. Jagren arrives with a minor shoulder wound. Extraction complete.

**Key Events:** Tunnel infiltration, shadow-step navigation, Essara found and extracted, Jagren's diversion successful, full team escape.

**Cliffhanger:** Essara sits in the cart looking at stars she hasn't chosen to look at in four months — free.
