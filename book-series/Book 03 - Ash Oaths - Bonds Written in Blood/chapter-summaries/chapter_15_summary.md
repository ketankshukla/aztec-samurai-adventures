# Chapter 15 Summary — THE BREAKOUT

**POV:** Jagren

Jagren reflects on the diversion at Facility Twelve's north gate. Three flash charges created the spectacle needed to draw guards. He retreated with discipline rather than fighting — honoring Neyla's non-lethal principle. He parried a guard's sword (two inches from his neck) and disengaged rather than counterattacking.

The rescue team regroups at the rendezvous. Essara proves sharp and observant, identifying each team member from Zariel's pre-capture letters. Neyla tells Essara that Zariel didn't choose the world over her — he chose the world because of her.

The team travels by boat toward Veranthos. Essara listens to Kaelen's full account of the war — the siege, the mirror-portals, Gravok, the Great Gate, the summit, Zariel's sacrifice. She absorbs it all and says one word: "Good."

Zariel receives Kaelen's coded message — PACKAGE DELIVERED — and weeps with gratitude.

**Key Events:** Jagren's disciplined retreat, team regroups, Essara learns the full war story, Zariel receives confirmation of rescue.

**Cliffhanger:** She was coming home. The most beautiful two words in any language.
