# Chapter 16 Summary — THE REUNION

**POV:** Zariel

Zariel waits at the harbor gate from dawn. The rescue boat arrives at nine. Essara climbs onto the pier and says "You look terrible." The siblings embrace — a long, quiet reunion without dramatic words.

Essara tells Zariel she's furious with him and has never been more proud. She says she would have been angry and ashamed if he'd traded the alliance for her. The neutral delegations witness the reunion from their balconies — the abstract political commitment given human weight.

Essara immediately volunteers for the war effort. She reveals she spent four months converting her captivity into intelligence: partially decoded Dominion communication codes, reconstructed facility layouts from sounds and vibrations, and tracked guard patterns. She demands to be put to work.

The alliance becomes more than a political construct — it becomes a human community connected by shared acts of courage and sacrifice.

**Key Events:** Zariel-Essara reunion, delegations witness the emotional payoff, Essara volunteers her intelligence skills, alliance deepens as human community.

**Cliffhanger:** Zariel returns to building the coalition with renewed purpose — his hands steady, his sister home.
