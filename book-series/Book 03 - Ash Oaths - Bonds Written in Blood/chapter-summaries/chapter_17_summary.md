# Chapter 17 Summary — THE VOTE

**POV:** Zariel

The Hall of Balanced Scales convenes for the final ratification of the Allied Compact. Pearlvaine's chair is empty — she departed the previous night. Each nation states its commitment:

- **Thalendor:** 5,000 heavy infantry, 200 cavalry, 20 mangonels. "We do not kneel."
- **Pyrrath:** 3,000 cavalry, 1,000 desert scouts, full intelligence network.
- **Coravel:** 200,000 gold crowns war fund, 12 ships, full supply chain access.
- **Sunhaven:** Agricultural reserves, medical resources, humanitarian expertise. "We cannot fight your war. But we will not let you starve."
- **Ashenmere:** Border defense, Deepwood intelligence network. "We are eyes. Use us well."

The compact is signed by all five leaders. Zariel signs last, his hand trembling with the weight of consequence. Itzil contacts him via mirror-relay and thanks him for showing her there's more than one way to fight a war.

**Key Events:** Allied Compact ratified, all five nations commit, military/financial/humanitarian/intelligence resources formalized, Pearlvaine gone.

**Cliffhanger:** The war is coming. The alliance is ready. Zariel begins drafting the first operational memo.
