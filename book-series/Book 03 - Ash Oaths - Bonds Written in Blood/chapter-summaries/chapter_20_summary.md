# Chapter 20 Summary — THE ALLIANCE FORMS

**POV:** Itzil

The allied camp at Aravalle has grown into a military city of 15,000 warriors. Itzil faces the challenge of integrating three different military cultures: Thalendor's rigid formations, Pyrrath's fluid cavalry, and the alliance's guerrilla fighters. Miyako runs daily coordinated combat exercises that are initially catastrophic but gradually improve.

Neyla establishes the oath-breaking training program. Twelve healer-students learn the technique. By week two, seven can perform full oath-breaking. Team-based methods emerge: one suppressor weakening the oath, one liberator finishing the job. Seven freed prisoners per week — small against 30,000, but the trajectory is upward.

The joint military council plans the first combined offensive: a strike on the Ashrun Corridor, a chokepoint in Dominion supply lines. Sethara proposes a three-vector assault — infantry front, cavalry flank through a mountain pass, scouts providing forward recon. Torvane builds signal relay devices for cross-terrain communication.

Itzil and Kaelen share an unspoken moment on the ridge at sunset — the growing connection between them acknowledged but not yet spoken.

**Key Events:** Army integration, oath-breaking program launched, first offensive planned against Ashrun Corridor, Itzil-Kaelen relationship deepens.

**Cliffhanger:** Ten days to make 15,000 strangers into an army. Itzil squares her shoulders and goes to work.
