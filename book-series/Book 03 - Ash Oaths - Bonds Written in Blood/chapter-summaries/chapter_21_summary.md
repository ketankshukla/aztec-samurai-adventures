# Chapter 21 Summary — THE SPY

**POV:** Kaelen

Kaelen discovers an anomaly in a Coravel shipping manifest: six cases of optical-grade glass — unnecessary for alliance equipment but essential for Dominion blood-mirrors. He connects this to Volzentar's known spy at the summit.

He narrows suspects to three Coravel delegation members and sets a classic counter-intelligence trap: three versions of false intelligence about the Ashrun Corridor offensive, each with a different attack date, fed to a different suspect. An intercepted Dominion dispatch (decoded by Essara) confirms the twelve-day timeline — identifying Clerk Tormund as the spy.

Tormund cooperates fully upon arrest. He was recruited through gambling debt leverage, not ideology. He reveals critical intelligence: Volzentar has been preparing Fortress Ashfall as a trap — underground tunnels, 30,000 hidden troops, blood-wards on every exit, cascading sorcery arrays. The Dominion wants the alliance to attack.

Itzil decides to proceed with the offensive anyway — canceling would fracture the coalition. But they'll go with open eyes: knowing it's a trap changes how they walk into it.

**Key Events:** Spy identified through counter-intelligence trap, Tormund arrested and cooperates, Fortress Ashfall trap revealed, Itzil decides to proceed knowing the danger.

**Cliffhanger:** Knowing is the difference between a trap and a battlefield.
