# Chapter 22 Summary — VOLZENTAR KNOWS

**POV:** Volzentar (Villain)

Volzentar convenes his war council in the obsidian war room beneath the Palace of the Split Crown. The central table is a carved map of the continent with crystal markers showing force dispositions. He briefs his council: Nightshade, Dalrignon, and the Ashvanar brothers (Korrath and Savren).

He confirms the spy's capture but reveals the alliance's overall strategy is compromised. His plan: let the alliance take the Ashrun Corridor (designed to fall as bait), then lure them to Fortress Ashfall — prepared for six months with 30,000 hidden troops in underground tunnels, blood-wards, and cascading sorcery arrays.

A secondary strike of 10,000 troops will simultaneously attack Sunhaven and Ashenmere — the two weakest alliance members who sent no soldiers. The coalition loses two members while its army is trapped at Ashfall.

Volzentar orders the Ashvanar brothers to target the Sun-Blade bearer and break the blade if possible. He references the Weeping One's prophecy about a "forger" who will reforge the blade — he plans to trigger and then prevent the prophecy.

**Key Events:** Volzentar's full trap plan revealed, Fortress Ashfall mechanism detailed, secondary strike on neutral nations planned, Sun-Blade targeted, Weeping One's prophecy referenced.

**Cliffhanger:** "Let them have their little army. When I break it, the despair will be exquisite."
