# Chapter 23 Summary — MARCHING ORDERS

**POV:** Itzil

The alliance army of 15,000 marches south. Itzil delivers a speech before departure — not polished but real, about the shared refusal to accept the Dominion's way. The army's morale is uncertain but committed.

The Ashrun Corridor falls on day three. Sethara's cavalry flanks through the mountain pass while Brennan's infantry engages the front. The coordinated three-vector assault works — imperfectly but successfully. First combined victory. Morale surges as the three military cultures begin to trust each other.

Itzil allows one night of celebration, then reveals the truth to the military council: Fortress Ashfall is a trap. Underground army, blood-wards, cascading sorcery — everything Tormund revealed. The council argues for retreat but Itzil counters: canceling fractures the coalition.

Her plan: the vanguard (led by Jagren) enters the fortress to confirm the trap mechanism and withdraws before the blood-wards seal. The main force deploys in a containment formation around the fortress — turning the trap inside out. Jagren volunteers to lead, knowing the risk.

The army marches toward Ashfall. The fortress appears on the horizon. The front gate is open.

**Key Events:** Army marches, Ashrun Corridor taken, first combined victory, trap revealed to council, counter-trap plan devised, Jagren volunteers for vanguard.

**Cliffhanger:** Itzil looks at the open gate and feels no fear — not because it's absent, but because she's learned to carry it.
