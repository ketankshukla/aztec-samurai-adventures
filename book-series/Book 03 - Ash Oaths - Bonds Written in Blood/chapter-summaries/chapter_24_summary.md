# Chapter 24 Summary — THE GATES OF ASHFALL

**POV:** Itzil

Fortress Ashfall is massive — black stone walls carved from a mountainside, 200 feet high, with a quarter-mile killing field before the open gate. Itzil deploys the army in a containment formation around the fortress perimeter, positioned at every concealed exit Kaelen identified.

Jagren leads 300 picked fighters through the open gate. The courtyard is staged-empty. Pyrrath scouts scale the towers and confirm: underground passages, blood-ward sigils on gates, sorcery arrays on walls. Jagren orders immediate withdrawal.

The blood-wards activate prematurely — someone in Dominion command panicked seeing the vanguard retreat. Jagren clears the gate by three feet as the crimson barrier seals behind him. The Dominion's hidden army of 30,000 pours from underground tunnels into the empty courtyard. The cascading sorcery strikes bare stone — the alliance army isn't inside.

Volzentar's trap closes on his own forces. The Dominion army is sealed inside the fortress by their own blood-wards. The alliance containment force surrounds every exit. The geometry is inverted: the trap is inside-out.

Volzentar's personal banner unfurls from the highest tower. His voice carries across the battlefield: "Welcome to my home. I's been expecting you." Itzil replies: "So have we."

The Ashvanar brothers begin breaking the blood-wards from inside to release the trapped army. The sky darkens with sorcery. Itzil draws the Sun-Blade and orders: "Hold the line."

**Key Events:** Fortress Ashfall approached, vanguard confirms trap, Jagren barely escapes blood-ward closure, Dominion army trapped inside own fortress, Volzentar revealed in person, battle begins.

**Cliffhanger:** The blood-wards crack. The walls shudder. The sky splits. And the battle begins — to be continued in Book 4.
