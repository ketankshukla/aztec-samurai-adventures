# Dramatis Personae

## The Alliance

- **Itzil** — Sun-Blade bearer, commander of the allied forces. A young warrior carrying the weight of a thousand-year tradition and an army that grows larger by the day.
- **Kaelen** — Scout and infiltrator. Last survivor of the 7th Reconnaissance Unit. Haunted but healing, his shadow-step technique makes him the deadliest covert operative in the alliance.
- **Jagren** — Duelist and vanguard commander. Once a glory-seeker, now a warrior learning that true courage has nothing to do with applause.
- **Neyla** — Healer. Her turquoise-gold magic can suppress ash-oath sigils — the first crack in the Dominion's most terrible weapon.
- **Torvane** — Engineer and inventor. Builds impossible devices from salvage and genius. His ward-disruptors and signal arrays give the alliance a technological edge.
- **Miyako** — Shadow school master. Grey-haired exile who spent decades in hiding before joining the alliance. Trains the team in coordinated combat.
- **Amalura** — Lorekeeper and scholar. Keeper of the Sealed Archive. Her knowledge of ancient history and ash-oath construction is critical to understanding the enemy.
- **Zariel** — Diplomat-spymaster. Golden-tongued, impeccably dressed, and lethally perceptive. Sees every conversation as a chess match. Sent to forge an alliance of neutral nations.
- **Essara** — Zariel's younger sister. Captured by the Dominion and used as leverage. Unbroken by her captivity.
- **Korvain** — Itzil's mentor. Master of the Sun-Blade temple. Guides from a distance with spare, precise counsel.
- **Corwen** — A farmer from Gracehold, freed from an ash-oath by Neyla. The first liberated witness to testify about the true nature of Dominion "autonomy."

## The Dominion

- **Volzentar** — Emperor of the Dominion. Amber-eyed strategist who sees the world as a mechanism to be optimized. Always three steps ahead.
- **Nightshade** — Dominion spymaster. Architect of psychological warfare. Sees people as structures with load-bearing beliefs and fracture lines.
- **Pearlvaine** — Dominion diplomat. Demon-bonded negotiator whose enhanced persuasion makes any truth sound like what the listener wants to hear. Elegant, warm, and terrifying.
- **Helisar** — The Fallen Saint. Runs a "sanctuary" called Gracehold that is actually an ash-oath factory. Gentle, kind-eyed, and utterly monstrous — he believes he is saving people from the burden of free will.
- **Dalrignon** — Portal Engineer. Building a filter mechanism for the Great Gate. Brilliant, amoral, and racing against an eighteen-month deadline.
- **Serenthar (The Weeping One)** — Demon-bound seer imprisoned beneath the Dominion palace. Perceives all timelines simultaneously. Weeps because the Gate will open.

## The Neutral Nations

- **Thalendor** — Mountain kingdom with formidable heavy infantry. Proud warriors who do not kneel.
- **Pyrrath** — Desert nation of cavalry and scouts. Already skirmishing with the Dominion on their southern border.
- **Coravel** — Coastal trading nation. Wealthy, cautious, and calculating. Provides ships and gold.
- **Sunhaven** — Agricultural heartland. Pacifist nation that cannot bring itself to fight.
- **Ashenmere** — Isolationist forest nation. Will defend their borders but will not cross them.
