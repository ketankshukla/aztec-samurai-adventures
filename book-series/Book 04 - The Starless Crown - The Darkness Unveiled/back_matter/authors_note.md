# Author's Note

Thank you for reading *The Starless Crown*.

This book was about cost — the real cost of war, measured not in strategy meetings but in the silence after the battle ends and the counting begins.

Jagren's journey is the heart of this book. He entered the story as a glory-seeker — the fastest blade, the brightest star, the man who fought for applause. At Fortress Ashfall, he discovered that glory is a lie told by people who have never held a dying boy in their arms. The moment he killed the Ashvanar sorcerer — that fraction-of-a-second gap in the shield, the blade going through — was not heroic. It was easy. And the ease terrified him more than the danger ever had.

Neyla saved him. Not with magic — with presence. She sat beside him on a stone and cleaned his sword and told him the truth: the fact that it scares you means you're still you. Six words that did more than any speech or strategy because they were aimed not at the warrior but at the person underneath.

Itzil learned to lead in this book — really lead, not just command. The speech in the rain was her defining moment. Not because it was eloquent — it wasn't. Because it was honest. She told an army of scared, angry, grieving soldiers that she was scared too. And that honesty was more powerful than any rhetoric because it was real.

The Starless Crown changes everything. The ticking clock is now visible — literally, in the sky. The void growing above the Dominion capital is the visual countdown to the end of the world. Every chapter from this point forward exists under that shadow.

Act I is over. The Rising is complete. What comes next — Act II, The Breaking — is exactly what it sounds like. The alliance will be tested to its limits. People you care about will suffer. The Dominion will press its advantage. And the Crown will keep growing.

But the alliance survives. Battered, diminished, changed — but alive. And alive, as Itzil has learned, is enough.

Book 5 takes us into the shadows with Kaelen. The rescue of Rainara. The counter-trap. The spy games that will define the second act of this war.

I hope you'll continue the journey.

With gratitude,
Ketan Shukla
