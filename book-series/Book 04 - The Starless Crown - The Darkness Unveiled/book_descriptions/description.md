# Book Description — Aztec Samurai Adventures Book 4: The Starless Crown - The Darkness Unveiled

## Subtitle: The Darkness Unveiled

---

<b>The trap closes. The sky goes dark. And the alliance learns what war really costs.</b>

<p>Fortress Ashfall was supposed to be Volzentar's masterpiece — thirty thousand hidden soldiers, blood-wards on every exit, cascading sorcery designed to destroy the alliance in a single engagement. The alliance walked in knowing it was a trap. They turned it inside out. And the cost of that victory was a third of their army and the discovery that glory dies the moment you hold a dying boy in your arms.</p>

<p><b>In this book:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>A duelist kills a sorcerer in the most intense combat the series has seen — and discovers that the ease of killing is more terrifying than the danger</li>
<li>A scout infiltrates a fortress of blood-magic and breaks the ward network with a vial of purified water — then discovers the enemy has found a vulnerability in his own body</li>
<li>A hawk rider named Skyren dives through a magical storm to rescue wounded soldiers, introducing the alliance's newest and most reckless member</li>
<li>Two neutral nations fall while the alliance is trapped — fifty thousand people ash-oathed in a single day</li>
<li>The Starless Crown appears: a ring of void in the sky, visible evidence that the dimensional barrier is thinning and the Hunger is coming</li>
<li>Volzentar sends a personal message to the Sun-Blade bearer: I know your name. I know the people you love.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Starless Crown is the final book of Act I — The Rising. The optimism is gone. What replaces it is resolve: hard, cold, unbreakable. The resolve of people who have been told the truth and have decided to fight anyway.</p>

<p>For fans of <i>The Poppy War</i>, <i>The Blade Itself</i>, and <i>The Name of the Wind</i> — a series where the cost of war is measured not in territory but in the silence after the battle, and the hardest thing a warrior can learn is that glory was never real.</p>

<p><i>The Crown grows. The clock ticks. And the alliance — battered, diminished, changed — prepares for what comes next.</i></p>

<p><b>Book 4 of 12 in the <i>Aztec Samurai Adventures</i> series. From Ketan Shukla, published by Metronagon.</b></p>
