# Chapter 1 Summary — THE JAWS OF THE TRAP

**POV:** Jagren

Jagren's vanguard of 300 warriors is sealed inside Fortress Ashfall by blood-wards. Dominion soldiers pour from twelve underground tunnel exits. Jagren organizes the trapped soldiers into a shield wall anchored against the western wall, using architecture as a force multiplier.

The Ashvanar brothers' cascading sorcery strikes from the walls — targeted lightning that blows gaps in the formation. Jagren fights at every gap, sealing breaches with his blade. A sixteen-year-old Thalendor recruit dies in his arms — the boy's eyes still open.

**Key Events:** Vanguard trapped, shield wall formed, cascading sorcery begins, Jagren fights at the front, young soldier dies in his arms.

**Cliffhanger:** Jagren lays the boy down. His hands are shaking. For the first time, glory feels like poison.
