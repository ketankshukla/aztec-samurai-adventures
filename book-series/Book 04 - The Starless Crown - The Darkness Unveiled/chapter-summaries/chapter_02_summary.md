# Chapter 2 Summary — OUTSIDE THE WALLS

**POV:** Itzil

Outside the fortress, Itzil commands the containment force. Torvane analyzes the blood-wards: they need a living caster (Nightshade) to maintain them. Break her concentration, the wards fall. Kaelen volunteers to infiltrate using shadow-step, which bypasses the wards' physical detection.

Itzil and Kaelen share a moment — "Come back." "Always." — before he vanishes into the fortress walls. Itzil raises the Sun-Blade as a beacon for the trapped vanguard inside.

**Key Events:** Blood-ward analysis, Kaelen volunteers for infiltration, Itzil-Kaelen moment, Sun-Blade beacon raised.

**Cliffhanger:** Kaelen vanishes into the fortress. Itzil turns back to the field battle and ignites the Sun-Blade.
