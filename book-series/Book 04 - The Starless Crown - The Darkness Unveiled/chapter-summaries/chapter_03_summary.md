# Chapter 3 Summary — THE WARLORD ARRIVES

**POV:** Volzentar (Villain)

Volzentar watches from the highest tower. The alliance knew about the trap and inverted it — his hidden army is sealed inside by his own blood-wards. He's surprised but not worried. He narrates the battle like a theater critic, assessing each alliance member.

He notes Kaelen's absence from the visible forces and warns Nightshade: "The scout is coming for you. Let him get close. Then break him." He orders the Ashvanar brothers to intensify their sorcery.

**Key Events:** Volzentar's tactical assessment, Kaelen's absence noted, Nightshade warned, sorcery intensified.

**Cliffhanger:** Volzentar steps onto the balcony and addresses the battlefield: "Sun-Blade bearer! I see you! Let me tell you how this ends."
