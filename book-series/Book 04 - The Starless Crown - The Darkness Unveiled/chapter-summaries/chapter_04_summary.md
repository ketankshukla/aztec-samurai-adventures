# Chapter 4 Summary — VOLZENTAR'S SPEECH

**POV:** Itzil

Volzentar addresses the entire battlefield with magically amplified voice. He offers surrender — spare your soldiers, spare your heroes. His words are not magic but pure charisma. Some allied soldiers hesitate.

Itzil doesn't respond with words. She ignites the Sun-Blade to its fullest blaze and charges the nearest Dominion formation. No speech. Just action. The hesitating soldiers see their commander charge and follow. The containment force shifts from defensive to offensive.

**Key Events:** Volzentar's surrender offer, allied hesitation, Itzil charges without speaking, morale restored through action.

**Cliffhanger:** Volzentar watches: "She didn't argue. She didn't negotiate. She just fought. How refreshing."
