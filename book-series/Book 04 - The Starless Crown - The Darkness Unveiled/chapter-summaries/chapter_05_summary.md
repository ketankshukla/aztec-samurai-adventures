# Chapter 5 Summary — KAELEN IN THE DARK

**POV:** Kaelen

Kaelen shadow-steps through the fortress interior — a labyrinth of corridors and traps. He navigates using memorized blueprints from Thessaly's intelligence. He reaches Nightshade's ritual chamber on sub-level four: a circular room with a blood pool at the center, six elite guards, and Nightshade maintaining the ward network.

His shadow-step window drops from 20 seconds to 10 in the blood-magic-saturated environment. He throws Neyla's vial of purified water into the blood pool.

**Key Events:** Fortress infiltration, Nightshade's chamber located, blood-ward environment degrades shadow-step, vial thrown into blood pool.

**Cliffhanger:** The vial arcs through crimson air toward the blood reservoir.
