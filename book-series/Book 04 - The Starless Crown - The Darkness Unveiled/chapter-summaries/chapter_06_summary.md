# Chapter 6 Summary — THE DUELIST'S CRUCIBLE

**POV:** Jagren

Ashvanar sorcerer Savren descends from the tower to personally lead the assault. Jagren challenges him — not for glory but to buy the vanguard breathing room. The duel is speed vs. magic: lightning bolts, dark shields, Jagren circling for a gap.

Jagren establishes a pattern (high-low-high), then changes on the fourth strike — lateral, through the shield's thinnest edge. His blade pierces Savren's chest. First villain killed in the series.

The ease of the kill terrifies him more than the danger.

**Key Events:** Savren descends, Jagren challenges him, intense duel, Jagren finds the gap and kills the sorcerer.

**Cliffhanger:** The scariest part isn't that it was hard. It's that it was easy.
