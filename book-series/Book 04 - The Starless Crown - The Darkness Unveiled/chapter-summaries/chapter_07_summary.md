# Chapter 7 Summary — THE WARD FALLS

**POV:** Kaelen

The purified water hits the blood pool and triggers a chemical-magical reaction — the blood boils, the basin cracks, the ward network collapses. Nightshade screams as magical feedback surges through her. The six guards attack Kaelen; he fights in shadow-step fragments — 2-second bursts.

The blood-wards across the fortress die. Nightshade turns her blood-magic directly on Kaelen, weaponizing the contamination from Gravok's old wounds. Pain drops him. Before she can finish him, the alliance breaches above — she chooses escape over the kill, vanishing through a blood-portal: "Next time, little shadow."

**Key Events:** Blood pool contaminated, wards collapse, Kaelen fights guards, Nightshade discovers Gravok scar vulnerability, Nightshade escapes.

**Cliffhanger:** The wards are down. The fortress is open. Nightshade has found a handle inside Kaelen she can use again.
