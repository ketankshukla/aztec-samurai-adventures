# Chapter 8 Summary — THE BREACH

**POV:** Itzil

The blood-wards fall and Itzil orders the full assault. The allied army breaches from every direction — Thalendor through the main gate, Pyrrath through eastern exits, alliance fighters through western exits. Itzil fights through the main corridor with the Sun-Blade blazing.

She finds Jagren standing over the dead Ashvanar, covered in blood. "I killed a sorcerer." "You saved everyone." "I know. It doesn't help." The pincer attack breaks the Dominion formation. Then the sky goes dark — the surviving Ashvanar brother goes berserk with grief-driven sorcery.

**Key Events:** Alliance breaches fortress, Itzil finds Jagren, pincer attack succeeds, Korrath's berserk storm begins.

**Cliffhanger:** The fortress is contested but the trap is broken. Then the sky goes truly dark.
