# Chapter 9 Summary — THE REMAINING BROTHER

**POV:** Itzil

Korrath, the surviving Ashvanar twin, channels his grief into an uncontrolled storm — lightning, acid rain, a churning vortex above the fortress. The sorcery is indiscriminate, killing allied and Dominion soldiers alike. Torvane's ward-disruptor weakens it but can't stop it.

Neyla works under fire healing burns and acid wounds. Skyren arrives — a hawk rider from Pyrrath who dives through the storm to rescue wounded soldiers trip after trip. Eleven rescues in twenty minutes. Lightning hits Cielovar's wing on the twelfth trip; Skyren crash-lands.

**Key Events:** Korrath's grief-storm, Torvane's disruptor deployed, Neyla heals under fire, Skyren introduced through aerial rescue, Skyren crash-lands.

**Cliffhanger:** "I'm Skyren. I heard you needed wings." "You're insane." "I know. That's why I'm good at this."
