# Chapter 11 Summary — THE CONTROLLED RETREAT

**POV:** Torvane

Torvane manages the retreat from Fortress Ashfall as an engineering project. He stands at the road junction directing every unit with signal relays and mapping instruments. Delayed explosive charges collapse sections of the approach road behind the retreating army, preventing Dominion pursuit.

Skyren provides aerial reconnaissance for safe retreat paths. The retreat is costly but controlled — not a rout. The fortress tower collapses (Korrath's sorcery exceeding structural tolerance). The margin: three seconds between survival and total destruction.

**Key Events:** Torvane directs retreat logistics, explosive charges sever roads, Skyren provides aerial recon, fortress collapses, three-second survival margin.

**Cliffhanger:** "Three seconds later and we'd all be dead." Engineering isn't flashy. Engineering is three seconds.
