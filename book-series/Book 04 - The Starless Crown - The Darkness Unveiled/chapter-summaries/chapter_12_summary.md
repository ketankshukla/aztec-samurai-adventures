# Chapter 12 Summary — THE BUTCHER'S BILL

**POV:** Itzil

The casualty count: 1,612 dead, 2,347 wounded, 209 missing. A third of the army. The military council fractures — Brennan threatens Thalendor's withdrawal. Itzil takes full responsibility: "I should have been louder. I should have been better. That's on me."

Zariel talks the council down via mirror-relay: "If we break now, every soldier who died today died for nothing." The coalition holds — barely. Itzil addresses the army, admitting her mistakes. The optimism of Act I is gone, replaced by grim resolve.

**Key Events:** Casualty report, council fracture, Itzil takes responsibility, Zariel prevents withdrawal, coalition holds barely.

**Cliffhanger:** The alliance holds — barely. But the optimism is gone. This is what real war feels like.
