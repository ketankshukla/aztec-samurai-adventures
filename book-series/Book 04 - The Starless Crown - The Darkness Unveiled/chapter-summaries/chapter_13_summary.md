# Chapter 13 Summary — SERENTHAR SEES

**POV:** Serenthar (Villain)

First extended Serenthar POV. Deep beneath the Dominion palace, the demon-bound seer watches the battle's aftermath through her visions — every possible outcome branching simultaneously. She sees Jagren's kill, Itzil's speech, Kaelen's wound.

Volzentar visits. She tells him: "The girl will not break from war. She breaks from love. You must take what she loves." When asked which person Itzil loves, Serenthar says: "Ask me again in three seasons. The answer will be obvious by then." She means Kaelen.

**Key Events:** Serenthar's visions revealed, probability distribution shifting toward the alliance, Volzentar learns Itzil's weakness is love not war.

**Cliffhanger:** Serenthar weeps because hope, for someone who sees every ending, is the cruelest thing of all.
