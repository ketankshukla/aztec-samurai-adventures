# Chapter 14 Summary — JAGREN'S SILENCE

**POV:** Jagren

Jagren hasn't spoken in two days. He sits at the camp's edge, staring at his hands, not eating or training. The loudest person in the alliance is silent.

Neyla comes. She doesn't talk — she sits beside him and begins cleaning his sword. After a long silence, Jagren speaks: "The scariest part isn't that it was hard. It's that it was easy." Neyla responds: "The fact that it scares you means you're still you."

The next morning, Jagren trains again — but differently. Slower, more deliberate. He's not performing anymore. He's practicing.

**Key Events:** Jagren's two-day silence, Neyla sits with him and cleans his sword, Jagren confesses fear of the ease of killing, Neyla's six-word healing.

**Cliffhanger:** A different Jagren walks back to the vanguard. The old performer is gone. The professional remains.
