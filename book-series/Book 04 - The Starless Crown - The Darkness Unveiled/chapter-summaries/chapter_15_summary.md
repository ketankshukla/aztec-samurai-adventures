# Chapter 15 Summary — THE CONQUERED NATIONS

**POV:** Itzil

A messenger arrives — a young woman with ash-oath scars on her wrists. She reports: Sunhaven fell in a single day (50,000 ash-oathed). Ashenmere held three days before falling — Queen Thessaly captured, ash-oathed, now processing her own citizens.

Volzentar's strategy is clear: the fortress was a distraction while secondary forces conquered the neutrals. Amalura calculates the Gate timeline shortened to 8-10 months. Itzil shifts strategy: liberation operations rather than conventional warfare.

**Key Events:** Sunhaven and Ashenmere conquered, messenger's testimony, Gate timeline shortened, strategy shifts to liberation campaign.

**Cliffhanger:** A refugee from Sunhaven: "They came at dawn. They said they were there to help. By noon, no one in my village remembered their own names."
