# Chapter 16 Summary — THE SECOND TRAP

**POV:** Kaelen

Intelligence arrives: Rainara, a water-knot mystic, has been captured by Relicara the relic collector. Relicara sends an obvious invitation: "Come and get them — if you dare." Kaelen identifies it as a layered trap — the obvious trap is the distraction; the real attack will come while the alliance focuses on the rescue.

Itzil approves a small-team rescue: Jagren and Skyren for the visible diversion, Kaelen and Zariel for covert infiltration. She stays with the main army to deny Volzentar information.

**Key Events:** Rainara's capture reported, trap analysis, rescue plan devised, teams assigned, Itzil-Kaelen departure moment.

**Cliffhanger:** "Come back." "Always." She grabs his arm. He covers her hand with his. Then he goes.
