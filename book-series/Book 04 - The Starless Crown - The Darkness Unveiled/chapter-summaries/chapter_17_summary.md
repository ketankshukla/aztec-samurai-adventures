# Chapter 17 Summary — KORVAIN'S COUNSEL

**POV:** Itzil

Itzil connects with Korvain via mirror-relay and reports everything. He advises: "This is where wars are lost — not in battles but in the silence after." He tells her to give the army the hard truth, then tell them WHY it's worth fighting through.

He warns about Volzentar's pattern: three sequential moves, each creating conditions for the next. "Don't give him the third win." He coughs — hard, long. Itzil notices for the first time how old and tired he looks. A cold fear settles about her mentor's mortality.

**Key Events:** Korvain's strategic advice, Volzentar's pattern identified, speech preparation guidance, Korvain's declining health noticed.

**Cliffhanger:** For the first time, Itzil notices how old Korvain looks. A cold fear that has nothing to do with the Dominion.
