# Chapter 18 Summary — RALLYING THE BROKEN

**POV:** Itzil

Itzil addresses the battered army on a muddy field in the rain. She doesn't give a polished speech — she admits she's scared, admits she walked them into a trap, admits she doesn't know if they can win. Then she tells them why they keep fighting: for the names the ash-oaths erased.

"There is no sitting this out. There is no neutral ground." The soldiers don't cheer — they stand up, pick up their weapons, and decide to keep going. Kaelen watches from the back and decides he will follow her anywhere.

**Key Events:** Itzil's raw, honest speech in the rain, admission of fear and mistakes, soldiers' quiet resolve, Kaelen's private commitment.

**Cliffhanger:** The soldiers stand. Not with cheers — with the quiet decision of people who've been told the truth and decided it's worth fighting for.
