# Chapter 20 Summary — NIGHTSHADE REPORTS

**POV:** Nightshade (Villain)

Nightshade reports to Volzentar: the fortress fell, both Ashvanar brothers are dead, but the alliance lost a third of its army. The Sun-Blade bearer rallied them through honest leadership — "She's more resilient than we calculated."

Volzentar reveals phase three: let the rescue succeed while monitoring for the alliance's deeper play. Meanwhile, Dalrignon activates tactical mirror-portals to strike the alliance's supply depot at Waystation Seven. "Wars aren't won on battlefields. They're won in granaries."

Nightshade asks about Kaelen. Volzentar: "What about him?" Nightshade: "He's good. Very good." Volzentar: "Then we'll need to be better."

**Key Events:** Nightshade's battle analysis, Volzentar's supply depot strike planned, tactical portals revealed, decision to let rescue succeed while harvesting intelligence.

**Cliffhanger:** "Then we'll need to be better." Nightshade begins planning for next time.
