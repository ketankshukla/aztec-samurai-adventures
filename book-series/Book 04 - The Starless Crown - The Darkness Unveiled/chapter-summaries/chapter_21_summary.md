# Chapter 21 Summary — THE DAWN AFTER

**POV:** Neyla

Neyla works in the medical pavilion for three days without sleep, healing hundreds of wounded. She's depleting her magical reserves — healing from an empty cup. Miyako finds her and teaches her a breathing technique to slow the depletion: "You cannot pour from an empty cup. Refill first."

Neyla tries ash-oath reversal on a captured Dominion soldier. With centered focus from the breathing technique, she cracks the oath deeper than ever. The soldier's eyes clear for a full minute. He says his name: "Dorian." Then the oath reasserts. Progress — incremental but real.

**Key Events:** Neyla's exhaustion, Miyako's breathing technique, ash-oath reversal progress, Dorian's name recovered for one minute.

**Cliffhanger:** The crack was deeper. The awareness lasted longer. She's getting closer. One person at a time.
