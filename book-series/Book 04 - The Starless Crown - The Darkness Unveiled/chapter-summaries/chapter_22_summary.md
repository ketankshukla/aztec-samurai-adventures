# Chapter 22 Summary — THE STAR THAT FELL

**POV:** Itzil

Itzil walks the camp perimeter at 2 AM and notices a patch of void in the sky — no stars, directly above the Dominion capital. Amalura identifies it: the Starless Crown. The Great Gate's growing presence is creating dimensional distortion, thinning the barrier. When the ring of void closes completely, the Gate opens and Vastrix comes through.

Timeline: months, not years. Possibly six months with the new ash-oath populations. Three paths to stopping it: starve the Gate (break oaths), destroy the Gate (reach the capital), or reforge the barrier (the Sun-Blade was part of the original barrier's creation).

**Key Events:** Starless Crown identified and named, Gate mechanics explained, three-path strategy established, book title given meaning.

**Cliffhanger:** "Then we don't have time to be broken." Itzil writes the liberation strategy through the night.
