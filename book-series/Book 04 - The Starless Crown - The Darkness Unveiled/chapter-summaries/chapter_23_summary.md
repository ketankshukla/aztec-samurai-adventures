# Chapter 23 Summary — THE SEPARATED PATHS

**POV:** Itzil

Itzil reorganizes the alliance for Act II. She assigns objectives: Kaelen/Zariel continue the Rainara rescue; Jagren/Skyren lead the visible diversion; Torvane fortifies a hidden base at Greystone Pass; Neyla expands the oath-breaking program; Miyako trains shadow-and-light combat teams; Skyren becomes the aerial intelligence network.

This is the first time Itzil delegates confidently — trusting each person with their specialty. She's becoming the leader Korvain trained her to be. "A leader who sends everyone away is not alone. She's everywhere."

**Key Events:** Alliance reorganized into specialized teams, missions assigned, Itzil delegates confidently, teams depart in five directions.

**Cliffhanger:** Itzil stands at the crossroads watching five paths diverge. The war enters its next phase.
