Chapter 6 - THE DUELIST'S CRUCIBLE

The Ashvanar brother descended from the tower like a storm given legs.

Jagren saw him coming — a figure wreathed in dark lightning, stepping off the wall-top parapet and falling sixty feet to the courtyard floor with the controlled grace of a sorcerer who had converted gravity into a suggestion rather than a law. He landed in the center of the Dominion formation — a crater of shattered stone marking his impact point — and the dark energy that surrounded him expanded outward in a shockwave that knocked allied soldiers off their feet and scattered the shield wall's eastern edge.

Savren. The elder Ashvanar twin. Tall, pale, dark-haired, with eyes that held the particular emptiness of a person who had spent decades studying destructive magic and had been emptied of everything the magic didn't require. His brother Korrath remained on the walls, maintaining the cascading sorcery arrays. Savren had come down to finish the fight personally.

The sorcerer walked through the Dominion formation — soldiers parting around him the way water parted around a heated blade. Dark lightning crackled from his fingers, arcing between his hands in patterns that were simultaneously beautiful and lethal. The air around him tasted of metal and ozone. The ground beneath his feet blackened with each step.

He was heading for the vanguard's center. For the shield wall. For the place where the fighting was thickest and the allied resistance was strongest.

For Jagren.

Not because he knew Jagren was there — not specifically. Because the sorcerer's instinct, honed through decades of magical warfare, drew him toward the point of greatest resistance the way a predator was drawn toward the strongest member of a herd. Break the strongest. The rest collapse.

Jagren saw him. Assessed him. Calculated the implications with the rapid tactical processing that combat had burned into his neural pathways over weeks of war.

A sorcerer on the field changed everything. The shield wall — designed to hold against infantry charges — was useless against a magical combatant who could shatter shields from thirty feet away and throw lightning through gaps in the formation. If Savren reached the wall, he would dismantle it. And when the wall fell, the Dominion infantry behind him would pour through and the vanguard's last defensive position would collapse.

Jagren made the decision in the space between one heartbeat and the next.

He stepped forward. Out of the formation. Into the open space between the shield wall and the advancing sorcerer. Alone.

"Hey!" he shouted. His voice cut through the battle noise with the particular projection of a man who had spent years performing for audiences and had learned that volume was less important than clarity. "Sparkles! Over here!"

Savren's empty eyes found him. The sorcerer paused — a fractional hesitation, the assassment of a new variable. He saw a young man with a blood-streaked blade, standing alone in the courtyard between two armies, calling a sorcerer "sparkles."

The dark lightning shifted. Targeted. Personal.

Jagren ran.

Not away — sideways. Drawing the sorcerer away from the shield wall, creating distance between the magical threat and the formation it would destroy. If Savren focused on him — if the sorcerer's attention locked onto a single target instead of the wall — the vanguard would get breathing room. The infantry could reform. The wounded could be evacuated.

He was buying time with his life. The currency of vanguard commanders.

Savren pursued. Lightning crackled — a bolt aimed at Jagren's center mass, moving at the speed of thought. Jagren threw himself sideways. The bolt struck the courtyard floor where he'd been standing — a detonation of dark energy that left a crater and sent stone fragments whipping through the air like shrapnel.

He rolled. Came up running. Another bolt — this one tracking his movement, curving in the air with the guided precision of sorcery that could think. He dove behind a collapsed section of wall. The bolt struck the masonry and exploded through it, showering him with stone dust and fragments.

The sorcerer was fast. His magic was faster. And the courtyard offered limited cover — open stone, scattered debris, the bodies of fallen soldiers that provided concealment but not protection.

Jagren circled. He was faster on foot than the sorcerer — Savren moved with the deliberate pace of someone who didn't need to hurry because lightning didn't need proximity. But Jagren needed proximity. His sword was useless at range. He needed to get close — inside the sorcerer's casting arc, where the lightning couldn't target him without hitting the caster.

He feinted left. Savren's lightning tracked the feint. Jagren reversed — a burst of speed that covered ten feet in a heartbeat — and closed the distance to fifteen feet. Ten. Five.

Savren raised a shield. Dark energy crystallized in front of him — a wall of black-purple light that hummed with concentrated magical force. Jagren's blade struck the shield and bounced — the impact jarring his arm from wrist to shoulder, the blade rebounding with a force that nearly tore it from his grip.

The shield was solid. Impenetrable to steel.

Jagren circled again. The sorcerer turned with him — tracking, shield adjusting, lightning building in the hand behind the shield for a strike that would come from behind the barrier at point-blank range.

The duel became a dance. Jagren attacked the shield — probing, testing, looking for weaknesses in the magical construct the way he'd been trained to look for weaknesses in any defense. High strike. The shield shifted up. Low strike. The shield dropped. Right side. Left side. The shield moved — responsive, adaptive, covering whatever angle Jagren attacked from with the fluid precision of a defense controlled by thought rather than muscle.

But the shield moved. It couldn't be everywhere at once. When it went high, the low angles opened. When it went left, the right was exposed. The shield was reactive — it followed the attack rather than preceding it, which meant there was a gap. A fraction of a second between the attack and the defense. A window.

Jagren was the fastest blade in the alliance. A fraction of a second was enough.

He launched a combination — high-low-high, the same pattern he'd been drilling, establishing the rhythm that the shield had been tracking. The shield moved — up, down, up — following the pattern with the automated response of a defense that had learned the sequence.

Then Jagren changed the sequence. The fourth strike came from the right — not high, not low, but lateral, at the exact angle the shield wasn't covering because it was still responding to the third high strike.

His blade found the gap. The steel passed through the shield's edge — the boundary where the magical energy was thinnest — and continued through. Into flesh. Into the space behind the shield where the sorcerer's body was protected by magic on every side except the one where the fastest blade in the alliance had found a fraction-of-a-second window.

The blade went through Savren's chest.

The sorcerer's empty eyes widened. The dark lightning died. The shield dissolved. The accumulated magical energy — the stored power of a sorcerer who had been channeling destruction for hours — dissipated in a shockwave that was felt throughout the fortress.

Savren fell. The first villain killed in the war. A sorcerer who had rained lightning on allied soldiers for hours, brought down by a young man with a sword who had found a gap in an impenetrable shield.

Jagren stood over the body. His blade was through the sorcerer's chest. His hands were steady — the shaking that had plagued him since the boy's death was gone, replaced by the absolute stillness of a body that had performed at the extreme limit of its capability and was now operating on empty.

Around him, the battle shifted. The Dominion soldiers — who had fought with the mechanical confidence of an army supported by sorcery — faltered. Their sorcerer was dead. The cascading lightning from the walls stuttered as Korrath, on the wall-top, felt his twin's death through the bond that connected them and staggered under the psychic impact.

The vanguard saw the opening. The shield wall surged forward — the allied soldiers charging into the gap created by the sorcerer's fall, reclaiming courtyard with the desperate aggression of people who had been pushed to the edge and were now pushing back.

Jagren didn't move. He stood over Savren's body in the crimson light and looked at his hands — the hands that had killed a sorcerer, that had found the gap, that had performed the single most extraordinary act of combat in the war so far.

The hands were not shaking. That was the terrifying part.

The kill had been easy. Not physically — physically, it had been the hardest thing he'd ever done. But the act itself. The moment of the blade going through flesh. The moment of ending a life. It had been easy in the way that breathing was easy — automatic, instinctive, the body performing a function it was designed for without requiring conscious permission.

He had spent weeks agonizing over the moral weight of combat. Over the boy with the open eyes. Over the gap between glory and reality. Over the question of what it meant to be a killer in a war that he'd chosen to fight.

And the answer — the answer he hadn't expected and didn't want — was that killing was easy. That the human body was a machine built for violence, and when the machine operated at peak efficiency, the violence flowed without friction or hesitation or the moral processing that was supposed to distinguish warriors from murderers.

The scariest part isn't that it was hard. It's that it was easy.

He pulled the blade free. Cleaned it on the sorcerer's robes. Turned to the battle.

The vanguard needed him. The shield wall needed reinforcement. The fight continued.

He would think about the easiness later. He would carry it — the knowledge, the fear, the terrible understanding that the best version of himself was also the version most capable of destruction. He would carry it the way he carried everything else: behind the discipline, behind the mask, behind the wall of duty that held the horror at bay.

Later. Now, the fight.

He raised his sword and walked back to the line.
