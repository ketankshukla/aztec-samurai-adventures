Chapter 9 - THE REMAINING BROTHER

The storm above Fortress Ashfall was not weather. It was grief given form.

Korrath stood on the highest tower — the last intact structure of the fortress, its black stone trembling beneath his feet — and poured every ounce of his sorcery into the sky. The dark energy left his body in waves — rippling outward from his extended hands, climbing the air in spirals of black-purple light that twisted into clouds and lightning and wind that screamed with a sound that was not natural and was not entirely magical but existed in the space between the two where a sorcerer's emotions became physical forces.

His brother was dead. Savren was dead. The other half of his existence — the twin who had shared his magic, his mind, his purpose for forty years — was lying on the courtyard floor with a sword wound through his chest, killed by a duelist who had found a gap in an impenetrable shield.

The bond between them had snapped. Not gradually — not the slow fading of a connection weakened by distance or time. Snapped. Like a rope under tension. One moment, Savren's presence had been there — the constant, ambient awareness of another mind operating in synchronization with his own, the shared consciousness that made their combined sorcery greater than the sum of its parts. The next moment, nothing. A void where a person had been. The silence of a room that should have contained a voice and contained instead the particular, unbearable absence that was louder than any sound.

Korrath had no framework for processing the loss. The twins had been together since before memory — since the womb, since the first cells divided and became two bodies with one shared magical signature. They had trained together, fought together, created together. Their sorcery was designed for harmony — each brother channeling half of a combined output that required two minds to control and one purpose to direct.

One mind. One purpose. Half the control.

The sorcery was uncontrolled. The cascading arrays on the wall — designed for precision targeting, calibrated to strike specific positions with minimal waste — were overwhelmed by the raw power Korrath was channeling. The arrays cracked. The sigils overloaded. The sorcery that had been falling on the courtyard in targeted strikes began falling everywhere — on the courtyard, on the walls, on the fortress itself, on the killing field beyond. Indiscriminate. Devastating.

Lightning struck the allied positions. Not the directed bolts of the earlier engagement — massive, branching discharges that hit with the force of small explosions, cratering the earth and sending soldiers flying. The wind howled — a vortex that grew with each second, pulling debris and dust into a churning column above the fortress. Rain began — not water but acid, the atmospheric moisture corrupted by the dark energy saturating the air, falling in drops that burned skin and corroded metal.

Torvane was the first to understand what was happening.

"He's destabilizing," the engineer said, his instruments tracking the sorcery's output with the frantic precision of gauges measuring a system approaching critical failure. "The remaining Ashvanar — he's channeling more power than the arrays can handle. The sorcery is feeding back into the fortress structure. If he keeps this up, the resonance will exceed the stone's tolerance and the entire building comes down."

"How long?" Itzil asked.

"Minutes. Maybe less."

Neyla was already working. She had established a triage point behind a section of collapsed wall — a makeshift medical station that was simultaneously the safest and most dangerous place on the battlefield. Safe because the wall provided cover from the lightning. Dangerous because the lightning was falling randomly and cover was only as reliable as the next strike's aim.

She healed burns. Acid wounds. The particular injuries that magical combat produced — tissue damage that didn't follow the patterns of physical trauma, internal disruptions that manifested as confusion, blindness, the temporary cessation of voluntary muscle control. Her turquoise-gold light flowed from patient to patient with the controlled intensity of a healer who had pushed past exhaustion into the state beyond, where the body operated not on energy but on purpose.

"I need more hands!" she called. The medical team — seven healers from three nations — was overwhelmed. The wounded were arriving faster than they could be treated. Some would die waiting. The calculus of triage: who can be saved, who can wait, who is beyond help.

Neyla didn't accept "beyond help." She treated everyone. Her magic was running thin — the reserves depleting with each healing, the turquoise light dimming from brilliant to steady to faint. Miyako's words echoed: You cannot pour from an empty cup. But the cup was not empty yet. Not quite. Not while there were people bleeding.

A Pyrrath scout was brought in — acid burns across her face and arms, the skin blistered and peeling, the underlying tissue exposed. The pain was written in her body — rigid, trembling, her jaw locked against the screaming that her training wouldn't permit. Neyla's hands settled over the burns. Turquoise light flowed. The tissue responded — slowly, reluctantly, the healing fighting against the magical corruption in the acid.

"Hold still," Neyla whispered. "I know it hurts. Hold still."

The scout held still. The burns closed — not fully, not cleanly, but enough. Enough to stop the tissue death. Enough to save the arm. Enough to keep a woman alive who would have died in twenty minutes without intervention.

Neyla moved to the next patient. And the next. And the next.

The storm intensified. Korrath's grief found new depths — the sorcerer screaming his brother's name from the tower, the sound carrying above the wind and the lightning and the grinding destruction of a fortress being torn apart by its own defenses. The vortex expanded. The lightning multiplied. The air itself began to crack — the atmospheric integrity compromised by magical forces that exceeded what the physical world was designed to contain.

Torvane deployed his ward-disruptor — the same technology that had suppressed blood-wards at Gracehold and Facility Twelve, modified for atmospheric targeting. The device hummed. A pulse of interference shot upward — striking the vortex's center, disrupting the magical frequency that sustained the storm.

The vortex weakened. The lightning diminished. For ten seconds, the storm faltered.

Then Korrath poured more power in. The vortex reasserted. The lightning resumed. The disruptor had weakened the storm but couldn't stop it — the sorcerer's output exceeded the device's suppression capacity by an order of magnitude.

"I can slow it down," Torvane said. "I can't stop it. Not with one disruptor. Not against that much power."

Itzil made the call. "Withdraw. All units. Controlled retreat. Get everyone out of the fortress before it comes down."

The retreat was costly but controlled. The alliance pulled back — unit by unit, the withdrawal coordinated by Torvane's signal relay, the route mapped by the scouts, the pace set by the wounded who could walk and the stretcher-bearers who carried those who couldn't.

They lost soldiers. The lightning found them in the open — strikes that fell on the killing field as the army withdrew, hitting formation gaps and exposed flanks with the random cruelty of destruction without purpose. Each strike was a detonation. Each detonation was a cost.

Skyren appeared.

A screech from above — cutting through the storm noise, through the thunder and wind and the cracking of the sky. A hawk. A massive, golden-feathered hawk with a wingspan that cast a shadow visible even in the storm's darkness, diving through the vortex with the controlled insanity of a rider who treated atmospheric sorcery as turbulence rather than a death sentence.

Skyren rode Cielovar with her knees and her voice — leaning into the wind, her body synchronized with the hawk's movements, her hands free for the work she'd come to do. She swooped low over the battlefield — lower than any sane person would fly in a magical storm — and grabbed a wounded soldier from the ground. One arm around his waist, the hawk's talons gripping his equipment, and up — climbing through the storm, carrying the soldier beyond the vortex's radius, depositing him at the medical station, and diving back in.

Trip after trip. Soldier after soldier. The hawk rider performed the impossible with the casual expertise of someone for whom impossible was a word that applied to other people.

Itzil watched her work — the golden hawk cutting through the black storm like a knife through cloth. "Who is that?"

"Skyren," Sethara said. The Pyrrath commander's voice carried a mix of exasperation and pride. "One of ours. Independent operator. I've been trying to get her assigned to a unit for two years. She keeps saying she works better alone."

Skyren landed beside Itzil between trips — windblasted, bleeding from storm-cuts on her face and arms, her flight leathers shredded by debris. The hawk, Cielovar, screamed at the storm with the affronted fury of a predator that did not appreciate competition for the sky.

"I'm Skyren," she said. Her grin was wild — the grin of a person who had just flown through a magical storm and considered it the most fun she'd had all week. "I heard you needed wings."

"You're insane," Itzil said.

"I know. That's why I'm good at this."

She was back in the air before Itzil could respond — the hawk launching from the ground with a force that scattered loose stones, climbing into the storm, diving for another wounded soldier.

The retreat continued. Skyren evacuated the critically wounded. Torvane's disruptors slowed the storm. The alliance pulled back — five hundred yards, a thousand, putting distance between themselves and the fortress that was dying.

The tower fell. Korrath's sorcery reached critical mass — the power output exceeding the fortress's structural tolerance, the stone failing under stresses it was never designed to bear. The tower leaned. Cracked. And came down — thousands of tons of black stone collapsing into the courtyard, triggering a chain reaction that brought the walls and gates and sub-levels down with it.

The impact shook the earth. A cloud of dust and debris erupted — a mushroom of pulverized stone that rose into the sky and was consumed by the storm that collapsed with the tower.

Silence. The storm was gone. The fortress was gone. The Ashvanar brother was gone — buried under the mountain of rubble that had been his final spell.

Itzil stood on the field and looked at the rubble and felt nothing. Not victory. Not relief. Not the satisfaction that should have accompanied the destruction of the Dominion's most elaborate trap. Nothing but the hollow, heavy emptiness of a commander counting losses and finding the number too high.

The alliance had survived. The trap was broken. The fortress was rubble.

But the cost. The bodies. The burned, the broken, the dead. The young soldier in Jagren's arms. The soldiers Skyren couldn't reach in time. The ones who had held the line and the ones who had fallen holding it.

This was what real war felt like. Not the clean, decisive engagements of strategy meetings and tactical plans. The ugly, grinding, soul-eroding reality of people dying in service of a cause they believed in, led by a commander who believed in them and sent them into danger anyway because the alternative was worse.

Itzil looked at the sky. The storm was gone but the darkness remained — the patch of void where stars should have been. The Starless Crown. Growing.

The war continued.
