Chapter 10 - SKYREN'S ENTRANCE

Skyren had been born in the sky, and the sky had never let her down.

The storm above Fortress Ashfall was the worst thing she'd ever flown through — worse than the sandstorms of the Pyrrath deep desert, worse than the mountain updrafts that could flip a hawk end over end, worse than the electrical storms that lit the southern coast like a war between gods. This storm was alive. The lightning didn't fall randomly — it hunted, tracking movement with the guided precision of a sorcerer's will. The wind didn't blow — it grasped, reaching for her hawk with fingers of concentrated force that wanted to tear Cielovar from the sky and dash them both against the fortress walls.

She flew through it anyway. Because that was what she did.

Cielovar was a Pyrrath golden hawk — fourteen feet of wingspan, talons that could punch through leather armor, eyes that could track a mouse from two thousand feet. The hawk had been Skyren's partner for six years, bonded through the Pyrrath falconry tradition that paired rider and raptor in adolescence and maintained the bond through a lifetime of shared flight. They communicated through pressure — Skyren's knees against Cielovar's flanks, her voice in the hawk's ear, the subtle shifts of weight and intention that translated human thought into avian movement.

The storm hit them at three hundred feet. The wind shear was immediate — a wall of turbulence that slammed into Cielovar's left wing and tried to flip them into a spiral. Skyren compensated — leaning right, pressing her left knee into the hawk's flank, her voice cutting through the wind with the calm, clear commands that Cielovar had been trained to obey regardless of conditions.

"Steady. Through it. Steady."

The hawk obeyed. Wings adjusted — the primary feathers fanning to catch the turbulence and convert it from a threat into a tool. The spin arrested. They punched through the wind shear and into the storm's interior, where the lightning was.

A bolt struck twenty feet to their left. The flash blinded Skyren for a heartbeat — white-purple light that erased the world and replaced it with afterimages. She flew blind for two seconds, trusting Cielovar's instincts, trusting the bond, trusting the six years of partnership that had taught her that the hawk could see things she couldn't and react to things she couldn't feel.

Vision returned. Below her, the fortress courtyard was a panorama of destruction — the allied retreat in progress, soldiers streaming through the gates, the wounded left behind on the blood-slicked stone because there weren't enough stretcher-bearers and the lightning was falling too fast for anyone on foot to reach them.

She saw a soldier — a Thalendor pike-man, his leg broken, dragging himself toward the gate with the desperate, animal determination of a person who wanted to live and was running out of options. The lightning was building above him — another cascade charging in the storm clouds, the sorcery gathering for a strike that would land exactly where he was crawling.

Skyren dove.

The descent was near-vertical — Cielovar folding her wings and dropping like a stone, the wind screaming past them, the ground rushing up with the terrifying speed of an object falling from three hundred feet with no intention of slowing down. At fifty feet, Skyren pulled up — Cielovar's wings snapping open, the deceleration crushing her into the hawk's back with a force that would have unseated an inexperienced rider.

She grabbed the pike-man. One arm around his waist, the other gripping Cielovar's harness. The hawk's talons closed on the soldier's equipment belt — the grip of a raptor designed to carry prey, repurposed for rescue.

They climbed. The lightning struck the spot they'd been occupying half a second earlier — a detonation that cratered the stone and sent shrapnel whipping through the air. A fragment caught Skyren's left cheek — a cut that bled immediately, the warm trickle running down her jaw and dripping onto the pike-man's armor.

She didn't notice. Pain was a background process during flight — filed, acknowledged, addressed later. The pike-man was heavy — two hundred pounds of armor and muscle, more than Cielovar usually carried. The hawk labored — wings beating hard, climbing through the storm with the determined effort of an animal that understood the mission even if it couldn't articulate it.

They cleared the storm's radius. The medical station was below — Neyla's triage point behind the collapsed wall section, the turquoise glow of healing magic marking it like a beacon. Skyren descended — controlled this time, a gliding approach that deposited the pike-man on the ground beside the healers with the professional care of a delivery that happened to involve a fourteen-foot hawk and a three-hundred-foot dive through magical lightning.

"Another one!" she called to the healers. "Broken leg. Possible internal. Handle it."

Then she was back in the air. Climbing. Into the storm. Into the lightning and wind and acid rain and the screaming vortex that the surviving Ashvanar brother was feeding with his grief.

Trip after trip. The routine was simple in concept and suicidal in execution: dive into the storm, find a wounded soldier, grab them, climb out, deposit at the medical station, repeat. Each trip was a gamble — the lightning tracking her with increasing accuracy, the storm's intensity building, Cielovar's endurance depleting with every altitude cycle.

She rescued eleven soldiers in twenty minutes. Eleven people who would have died on the courtyard floor, crushed by falling stone or struck by lightning or simply bled out while the army retreated around them. Eleven lives measured against the risk of one hawk rider who considered mortality a suggestion rather than a rule.

The twelfth trip almost killed her. The lightning found her at two hundred feet — not a near-miss but a direct hit on Cielovar's left wing. The hawk screamed — a sound that Skyren had never heard in six years of partnership, the sound of an animal experiencing pain beyond its reference frame. The wing folded. They dropped.

Skyren's training engaged. She shifted her weight — not fighting the spin but guiding it, converting the uncontrolled descent into a controlled spiral that used the remaining wing's lift to slow their fall. Cielovar responded — the injured wing extending partially, catching enough air to convert a fatal plummet into a crash landing that was merely catastrophic.

They hit the ground hard. The impact was absorbed by Skyren's legs and Cielovar's braced talons — the riding posture designed for exactly this, the falconry harness distributing the force across the hawk's frame. They skidded across the killing field, plowing a furrow in the churned earth, coming to rest fifty yards from the medical station.

Skyren lay in the dirt for three seconds. Her body conducted an inventory — ribs intact, spine functional, limbs responsive. Cielovar was beside her, the hawk's left wing hanging at an angle that was wrong, the feathers scorched where the lightning had struck.

"Easy, girl," Skyren whispered. Her hand found the hawk's neck — the warm feathers, the rapid pulse beneath. "Easy. We're down. We're okay."

Cielovar screamed again — not pain this time but outrage. The hawk did not appreciate being grounded. The hawk considered the ground a temporary and regrettable necessity between flights, and being forced onto it by a magical storm was a personal insult that Cielovar fully intended to avenge as soon as her wing was functional.

Neyla arrived. The healer assessed the hawk's wing with the same professional efficiency she brought to human patients — her turquoise light probing the injury, reading the damage, calculating the treatment.

"Dislocated. Not broken. I can fix it."

"Fix her," Skyren said. "She'll want to fly again."

"In this storm?"

"After this storm. She holds grudges."

Neyla healed the wing. The turquoise light settled into the joint — coaxing the bone back into alignment, repairing the stressed tendons, soothing the inflammation. Cielovar accepted the treatment with the impatient tolerance of an animal that understood help but resented needing it.

Skyren stood. She looked at the storm — still raging, the vortex still building, the Ashvanar brother still screaming his dead twin's name from the tower. She looked at the medical station — the wounded, the healers, the organized chaos of a triage operation running at capacity.

She looked at Itzil, who had appeared on the field — the Sun-Blade dimmed to its resting glow, the commander's face carrying the particular expression of someone who had just watched a hawk rider perform eleven suicidal rescues and was trying to decide whether to commend her or court-martial her.

"I'm Skyren," she said. Her grin was unchanged — wild, uncontrolled, the expression of a person who had just been struck by magical lightning and crashed from two hundred feet and was already planning the next flight. "I heard you needed wings."

"You're insane," Itzil said.

"I know. That's why I'm good at this."

The storm collapsed minutes later — Korrath's sorcery reaching critical mass, the tower falling, the fortress collapsing into rubble. Skyren watched the destruction from the ground, Cielovar beside her, the hawk's wing healing under Neyla's continued treatment.

Eleven soldiers. Eleven lives. Eleven trips through a magical storm that should have killed her on the first dive.

Skyren looked at the rubble that had been Fortress Ashfall and felt nothing but the simple, unremarkable satisfaction of a person who had done their job. Not glory — she had no use for glory. Not heroism — heroism was a word other people used for things that felt, from the inside, like ordinary competence applied in extraordinary circumstances.

She had flown. She had carried. She had brought people home.

That was enough. That was always enough.

Cielovar screamed at the sky. The hawk was grounded but not defeated. The wing was healing. The storm was gone. And the sky — scarred, darkened, carrying the void of the Starless Crown — was still there.

Waiting.

Skyren looked up at it and grinned.

"Soon, girl," she told the hawk. "Soon."
