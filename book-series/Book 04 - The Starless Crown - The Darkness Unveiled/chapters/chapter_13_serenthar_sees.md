Chapter 13 - SERENTHAR SEES

Seven levels beneath the Palace of the Split Crown, in a chamber that had never known light, Serenthar wept.

The tears were not water. They were something older — a substance that existed in the space between dimensions, produced by eyes that saw not the present but every possible future simultaneously. The tears ran down her grey cheeks in dark streaks that caught no light because there was no light to catch, and pooled on the black stone of her throne in patterns that shifted and reformed like clouds seen from above.

She sat as she always sat — motionless, her demon-crystal eyes glowing amber-red in the darkness, her white hair pooling around her like spilled milk. The chains that bound her to the throne were ceremonial — she could have broken them decades ago if she'd wanted to. She didn't want to. The chains were a reminder. A boundary. The thing that separated the woman she had been from the thing she had become.

The visions came in waves. Not sequentially — simultaneously. Every possible outcome of the battle at Fortress Ashfall existed in her consciousness at once, each one a thread in a tapestry so vast that comprehending it required a mind that had been expanded beyond human limits by the demon-crystal embedded in her skull.

She saw Jagren standing over the dead Ashvanar. In one timeline, the duelist's blade missed — deflected by the shield, the sorcerer surviving, the vanguard destroyed. In another, the blade struck true but Jagren died in the process — the sorcerer's dying blast consuming him. In the timeline that had actually occurred — the one that reality had selected from the infinite possibilities — both events happened: the blade struck, the sorcerer died, and Jagren survived. Barely. Changed.

She saw Itzil's speech to the battered army. In most timelines, the speech worked — the alliance held together, the resolve solidified, the war continued. In a few, the speech failed — Brennan withdrew Thalendor, the coalition fractured, the war ended in six months with the Dominion's complete victory. In one timeline — a thin, improbable thread that Serenthar tracked with particular attention — Itzil didn't give a speech at all. She walked away. Disappeared into the mountains. And the alliance, leaderless, became something different. Something Volzentar couldn't predict.

That timeline was interesting. Serenthar filed it.

She saw Kaelen's wound — the contamination from Gravok's claws, activated by Nightshade's blood-magic. In most timelines, the contamination remained a vulnerability — a handle that any blood-mage could grab. In some, Neyla found a way to purify it. In others, the contamination grew — spreading through Kaelen's body, converting him slowly, imperceptibly, into something that the Dominion could use.

That timeline was dangerous. Serenthar filed it too.

The visions shifted. Past became present became future, the temporal boundaries dissolving in a consciousness that existed outside time's normal architecture. She saw what was coming — not one future but all futures, branching and merging and splitting again in the infinite decision tree that was the universe's response to free will.

The footsteps came from above. Heavy. Measured. The particular cadence of a man who walked the way he thought — with deliberate, calculated precision.

Volzentar descended. The stairwell to Serenthar's chamber was carved from obsidian — a spiral that wound down through seven levels of increasingly dark stone, each level colder than the last, the temperature dropping as the distance from the surface increased. By the time he reached the bottom, his breath was visible — a fog that caught the amber-red glow of Serenthar's eyes and turned the color of old blood.

He entered the chamber. He did not bow — he never bowed, to anyone, for any reason. He stood before the Weeping One and met her gaze with the steady, analytical focus of a man examining a mechanism.

"Report," he said.

Serenthar's voice was a whisper — the voice of a woman who had not spoken above a whisper in twenty years because the visions consumed the energy that louder speech required. The whisper carried, though. In the absolute silence of the chamber, a whisper was a shout.

"The one who fights for glory learned what glory costs," she said. "Just as I said."

"Jagren. The duelist." Volzentar filed the name. "He killed Savren."

"He did. In most timelines. In some, Savren kills him. In one, they kill each other. Reality chose the version where your sorcerer dies and their warrior survives." A pause. Dark tears ran. "Reality has been choosing their versions more often lately. The probability distribution is shifting."

"Shifting how?"

"Toward them. The Sun-Blade bearer. The scout. The diplomat. The healer. The duelist. They are becoming what they need to become — faster than you predicted. The crucible is forging them."

"Crucibles are controllable. Apply too much heat and the metal breaks."

"Apply too little and it never hardens." Serenthar's amber-red eyes found his amber ones — two sets of eyes designed for assessment, one human and one something else, meeting in a darkness that was both physical and metaphorical. "What comes next?"

"The conquered nations. Sunhaven and Ashenmere fell while the alliance was trapped at Ashfall. Two members of the coalition, lost. The alliance will fracture."

"It won't."

The certainty in her voice made Volzentar pause. Not stop — he never stopped. But pause. The fractional hesitation of a man encountering information that contradicted his projections.

"Explain."

"The girl will not break from this. Not from war. Not from losses. Not from the weight of command or the guilt of decisions that cost lives. She breaks differently." Serenthar's whisper dropped lower — the voice finding frequencies that existed at the edge of hearing. "She breaks from love. Not war."

"Love."

"The thing she hasn't named. The thing growing between her and the scout. It's invisible to everyone — almost. But it's there. A fracture line in her armor. The one place where the commander disappears and the person emerges." The dark tears flowed faster. "You must take what she loves. That is how she breaks."

Volzentar processed this. His mind — the mechanism that treated emotions as variables and people as systems — converted the information into strategic data. The Sun-Blade bearer's weakness was not military. It was personal. Not the army, not the blade, not the alliance. A person. A specific person.

"Which one?" he asked. "Which one does she love?"

Serenthar wept harder. The tears pooled on the throne's black stone and formed patterns that looked, if you stared long enough, like a map of futures that would never happen.

"Ask me again in three seasons," she said. "The answer will be obvious by then."

She would not say more. The visions pressed — the weight of infinite futures compressing her consciousness, the demon-crystal pulsing in her skull with the steady rhythm of something that fed on temporal perception and was never satiated. She closed her amber-red eyes. The chamber went dark.

Volzentar stood in the darkness for a long time. Then he turned and climbed the seven levels back to the surface, carrying the information like a weapon he had not yet learned to use.

Love. The Sun-Blade bearer's weakness was love.

He would find it. He would exploit it. And when he did, the girl who had charged his army without speaking and turned his trap inside out and refused to break under pressure that had broken better commanders — that girl would shatter.

Not from war. From love.

The cruelest weapon in the arsenal. The one that never missed.

Serenthar wept in the darkness. She wept because the odds favored the Hunger. She wept because the odds were not zero. And she wept because the love that would break the Sun-Blade bearer was the same love that might, in some improbable futures, save her.

The Weeping One saw all futures. In most of them, the Crown closed and the world ended.

In a few — a precious, improbable few — it didn't.

She wept for those futures hardest of all. Because hope, for someone who saw every possible ending, was the cruelest thing of all.
