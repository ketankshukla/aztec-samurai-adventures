Chapter 17 - KORVAIN'S COUNSEL

The mirror-relay connected at midnight, and Korvain's face appeared in the polished silver with the particular clarity of a man who had been waiting for the call.

He looked old. Not the dignified, weathered old of a master who had aged gracefully into wisdom — the tired old of a man whose body was failing faster than his mind and who was fighting both battles with the same stubborn refusal to surrender that had characterized his entire life. His eyes were still sharp — the dark, penetrating eyes that had trained Itzil and a generation of Sun-Blade acolytes. But the skin around them was thinner. The lines deeper. The posture that had once been ramrod-straight was softened by the particular curve that came not from weakness but from the accumulation of years pressing down on a frame that had been carrying weight for too long.

Itzil saw all of this in the first second. She filed it — not in the operational archive where tactical data lived but in the personal archive where the things that mattered most were kept and protected.

"Master," she said.

"Commander." His voice was the same — dry, precise, carrying the particular authority of a man who spoke rarely and meant everything. "Report."

She told him everything. The fortress trap. The casualties. The conquered nations. Sunhaven's fifty thousand ash-oathed. Ashenmere's queen bound and processing her own people. The Gate's shortened timeline. The alliance's fractured morale. Rainara's capture. The rescue mission already underway.

Korvain listened. He didn't interrupt — he never interrupted. He absorbed information the way stone absorbed rain: slowly, completely, the understanding seeping through layers of experience until it reached the bedrock of judgment where decisions were made.

When she finished, the relay was quiet for a long time. The kind of quiet that existed between teacher and student when the lesson was too important for haste and the teacher was choosing words the way a swordsman chose strokes — each one deliberate, each one aimed.

"This is where wars are lost, Itzil." His voice was quiet — not weak, not tired, but conserving energy. "Not in battles. Not in the clash of armies or the fall of fortresses. Wars are lost in the silence after. In the space between the defeat and the response. Your people are afraid. Afraid people make bad decisions. They retreat when they should hold. They attack when they should plan. They fracture when they should consolidate."

"I know."

"Your job right now isn't to fight. It's to keep them from breaking."

"How?" The question was honest — not rhetorical, not performative. The question of a student who had outgrown the curriculum and was encountering problems that the training hadn't covered.

"Tell them the truth." Korvain's eyes held hers through the mirror-relay — the steady gaze of a man who had been teaching truth for fifty years and had never found a substitute. "Not the easy truth — the hard one. Tell them it's going to get worse before it gets better. Tell them the Dominion is stronger than we thought and the timeline is shorter than we hoped and the war we planned for isn't the war we're fighting."

"That'll terrify them."

"Good. Terrified people who know what they're facing are infinitely more useful than confident people who don't. Fear without information is panic. Fear with information is preparation." He paused. "Then tell them WHY it's worth fighting through the worse part. Not the strategic reasons — they know those. Tell them the human reasons. The people in Sunhaven who lost their names. The queen in Ashenmere who's binding her own citizens with hands she can't control. The farmer Corwen, who sat in that summit hall and told five nations what it meant to be ash-oathed."

"Tell them what we're fighting for."

"Tell them WHO we're fighting for. Strategy is for commanders. Purpose is for soldiers. Give them a purpose that's bigger than survival and they'll fight through anything."

The advice settled into Itzil's mind with the weight of something that had been waiting to be said — the final piece of a puzzle she had been assembling since the fortress, the element that would convert the alliance's fear into fuel.

"There's something else," Korvain said. His tone shifted — subtly, from the measured delivery of a teacher to something more personal. More urgent. "Volzentar's pattern. I've been studying it. The fortress. The neutral nations. Rainara."

"Three moves."

"Three moves, each building on the last. The fortress committed your army. The neutral nations weakened your coalition. Rainara splits your attention. He's not winning battles — he's winning sequences. Each move creates the conditions for the next." Korvain leaned forward — the movement slow, careful, the movement of a man managing pain. "Don't give him the third win. The rescue mission for Rainara — it's necessary. But be prepared for what he does while your people are committed to it."

"Kaelen thinks the rescue is a distraction. The real attack will come while we're focused on it."

"Kaelen's instincts are sound. Trust them." A pause. "And trust your own. You've grown, Itzil. The girl who stood in my temple and fumbled through her first Sun-Blade activation — she's gone. The woman who held a coalition together through a diplomatic crisis and a military disaster and the loss of two nations — she's here. Trust her."

Itzil felt something shift — the particular internal adjustment that occurred when a teacher's approval reached the student who had been unconsciously seeking it. Not validation — Korvain didn't validate. Recognition. The acknowledgment that the student had become something the teacher could respect.

"Thank you, Master."

"Don't thank me. Win. That's better."

He coughed. The sound was sharp — not the clearing of a throat but the involuntary spasm of lungs that were not functioning as they should. The cough continued — longer than it should have, harder than it should have been, the kind of cough that originated not from irritation but from dysfunction.

Itzil watched. The cough subsided. Korvain waved it off with the practiced dismissal of a man who had been waving off symptoms for months. "Old bones," he said. "The mountain air is thin this season."

But Itzil saw it. For the first time — not the first time it had been there, but the first time she allowed herself to see it — she noticed how old he looked. How tired. The skin that was too thin. The posture that was too curved. The cough that was too persistent.

A cold fear settled in her chest. Not the military fear that she had learned to manage — the fear of defeat, the fear of losses, the fear of command decisions that cost lives. A different fear. Older. More personal. The fear of a student looking at a teacher and seeing, for the first time, that teachers were mortal.

"Master," she said. The word carried weight it hadn't carried before — the weight of time, of distance, of the growing awareness that the conversations they were having might be finite.

"I'm fine," Korvain said. The lie was delivered with the same precision he brought to everything — clean, efficient, unconvincing. "Focus on the war. Focus on your people. Focus on the speech you need to give tomorrow."

"What speech?"

"The one that tells them why they keep fighting. The one that converts fear into purpose. The one that a commander gives when everything has gone wrong and the only way forward is through the worst of it." He almost smiled — the expression that existed at the corners of his mouth and reached his eyes only on rare occasions. "You'll know what to say. You always do. Even when you don't think you will."

The relay dimmed. Korvain's face faded — the sharp eyes, the thin skin, the particular expression of a man who had taught his last student everything he knew and was watching her use it from a distance that grew larger every day.

Itzil sat in the command tent and held the darkened relay and felt the cold fear in her chest — the fear that had nothing to do with the Dominion and everything to do with time. The fear that the man who had shaped her into the person she was becoming was running out of the one resource that no amount of skill or wisdom or stubbornness could replenish.

Time. The thing that wars consumed. The thing that the Starless Crown measured in its growing void.

She set the relay down. She opened her notebook — the journal she kept for speeches and operational notes and the private thoughts that she trusted to paper because paper didn't judge and paper didn't leak. She began writing.

Not a speech — not yet. Notes. Fragments. The pieces of what she would say tomorrow to an army that was afraid and needed a reason to keep going.

The words came slowly. They were not elegant — she was not Zariel, not a wordsmith, not a person for whom language was a natural medium. But they were honest. And honest, as Korvain had taught her and Zariel had confirmed and the war had proven, was the most powerful thing a person could be.

She wrote until dawn. The Starless Crown hung in the sky above the camp — a void where stars should have been, growing, measuring the time they had left.

She would give the speech. She would tell them the truth. She would convert their fear into purpose.

And she would carry the cold fear in her chest — the fear about Korvain, about time, about the growing distance between teacher and student — because carrying fear was what commanders did. They carried it so their soldiers didn't have to.

The dawn came. The speech waited. And somewhere on a mountain far to the north, an old man sat in a temple that had trained warriors for a thousand years and coughed — quietly, privately, in a room where no one could see him — and looked at the Starless Crown through his window and wondered how much time he had left.

Not enough. It was never enough.

But it was what there was. And what there was would have to be sufficient.
