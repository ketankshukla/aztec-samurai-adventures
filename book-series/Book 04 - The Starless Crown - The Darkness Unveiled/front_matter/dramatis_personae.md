# Dramatis Personae

## The Alliance

- **Itzil** — Sun-Blade bearer, commander of the allied forces. Leading an army battered by Fortress Ashfall, holding the coalition together through will and resolve.
- **Kaelen** — Scout and infiltrator. Wounded by Nightshade's blood-magic at Ashfall, carrying scars that connect him to the Dominion's darkest sorcery.
- **Jagren** — Duelist and vanguard commander. Killed an Ashvanar sorcerer at Ashfall. The glory-seeker is gone; what remains is a warrior haunted by the cost of combat.
- **Neyla** — Healer. Pushing the boundaries of ash-oath reversal while treating hundreds of wounded. Learning to refill the cup before pouring from it.
- **Torvane** — Engineer and inventor. The invisible hero — every soldier who survived the retreat from Ashfall owes their life to his calculations.
- **Miyako** — Shadow school master. Training warriors in coordinated shadow-and-light combat. The teacher who came out of hiding and found a war.
- **Amalura** — Lorekeeper and scholar. Discoverer of the Starless Crown — the visible evidence of the Great Gate charging in the sky above the Dominion.
- **Zariel** — Diplomat-spymaster. Builder of the Allied Compact, now managing a coalition strained by catastrophic losses.
- **Essara** — Zariel's sister. Intelligence analyst whose language skills and facility-gained knowledge make her invaluable to alliance operations.
- **Corwen** — Freed ash-oath survivor. His testimony changed five nations. Now working with Neyla's oath-breaking program.
- **Korvain** — Itzil's mentor. Growing old and tired, but his counsel remains the compass by which Itzil navigates.
- **Skyren** — Hawk rider from Pyrrath. Rides the golden hawk Cielovar. Brave, independent, and absolutely insane by ground-fighter standards. New to the team.

## The Dominion

- **Volzentar** — Emperor of the Dominion. Architect of the Ashfall trap. Three steps ahead and entertained by the alliance's resilience.
- **Nightshade** — Dominion spymaster. Blood-magic specialist. Escaped Kaelen at Ashfall with a whispered promise: "Next time, little shadow."
- **The Ashvanar Brothers** — Twin sorcerers. Savren killed by Jagren at Ashfall. Korrath survives — unhinged by grief, his sorcery growing more destructive and less controlled.
- **Dalrignon** — Portal Engineer. Rebuilding the mirror-portal network with distributed anchors. Racing against his eighteen-month deadline.
- **Relicara** — Relic collector. Has captured the water-knot mystic Rainara and two of the seven relics. Setting a trap the alliance must walk into.
- **Serenthar (The Weeping One)** — Demon-bound seer. Sees all futures. Weeps because the Crown grows and in most timelines, it closes.

## Key Figures

- **Rainara** — Water-knot mystic. Captured by Relicara. Her abilities could tip the balance of the war — if the alliance can rescue her.
- **Commander Brennan** — Thalendor's military attaché. Stern, professional, questioning whether the alliance can survive.
- **Commander Sethara** — Pyrrath's desert commander. Copper-haired, direct, committed to the fight regardless of losses.
