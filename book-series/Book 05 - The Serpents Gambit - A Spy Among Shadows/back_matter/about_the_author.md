# About the Author

**Ketan Shukla** is the author of the *Aztec Samurai Adventures* series and multiple non-fiction titles. He writes stories about courage, cleverness, and the stubborn refusal to stop fighting — even when the enemy is smarter than you.

He lives with his wife Nimisha and believes that the best lies are built from truth, the best plans have layers, and the best stories are the ones that make you check over your shoulder.

*Aztec Samurai Adventures* is his first fiction series.
