# Author's Note

Thank you for reading *The Serpent's Gambit*.

This book belongs to Kaelen — the scout, the shadow, the man who lives between visibility and absence. His mind is the engine of this story: the layered plans, the counter-deceptions, the instinct that sees traps inside traps and responds by building traps of his own.

But this book also introduces the opponent who makes Kaelen's brilliance insufficient: Valdremor. The Architect. The man with the crystal eye and the calm voice who doesn't want power — he wants completion. He designs mechanisms and ensures they execute. The Gate is his masterwork. The world's destruction is a side effect he has noted and filed.

Valdremor terrifies me as a writer because he's not evil in the way we expect villains to be evil. He doesn't rage. He doesn't monologue. He doesn't hate the heroes. He simply builds, and what he builds will end the world, and he considers this an acceptable outcome because the design demands it.

Relicara's story broke my heart. A woman who built her entire identity on a lie — the lie that her collection was hers, that her purpose was preservation, that she was a custodian rather than a warehouse. When Valdremor took that lie away with six words, she destroyed everything rather than live with the emptiness. That's not villainy. That's grief.

Rainara brings fury to the alliance — the righteous, burning fury of a person who was caged and dehydrated and treated like an object. Her power is magnificent. Her anger is concerning. The tension between the two will define her arc.

And the quiet moments. Itzil and Kaelen on the night watch. "Something I've never had." "A reason to stay in one place." Two people orbiting each other with decreasing distance and the growing certainty that the orbit will close — and the growing fear that closing it will make them vulnerable to an enemy who has already identified love as their weakness.

Act II has begun. The Breaking is underway. Book 6 brings the storm that the silence promised.

I hope you'll be there when it hits.

With gratitude,
Ketan Shukla
