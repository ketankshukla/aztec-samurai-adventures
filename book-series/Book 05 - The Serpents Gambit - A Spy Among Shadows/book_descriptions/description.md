# Book Description — Aztec Samurai Adventures Book 5: The Serpent's Gambit - A Spy Among Shadows

## Subtitle: A Spy Among Shadows

---

<b>The rescue was his plan. The relic was his weapon. And the enemy you can't see is the enemy you can't beat.</b>

<p>Kaelen designs the most elaborate operation the alliance has attempted — a counter-trap within a trap, layered with deceptions and false intelligence. The mission: rescue the water-knot mystic Rainara from a relic collector's mountain fortress. The result: a success so clean it can only mean the enemy wanted it to happen.</p>

<p><b>In this book:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Valdremor — the Architect — is introduced: the intellectual power behind the Dominion, the man with the crystal eye who designed the ash-oath system, the Gate's activation sequence, and the mechanism that will end the world</li>
<li>A relic collector discovers her life's work was a lie and destroys seven hundred irreplaceable artifacts rather than live in a warehouse she mistook for a museum</li>
<li>A water-knot mystic is freed — and her fury reshapes every battlefield she touches</li>
<li>A tracking sigil reveals the enemy has known the alliance's location for days</li>
<li>The Sun-Blade is incomplete — and the armorer says it's listening</li>
<li>Dominion communications go dark. The silence before the storm.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Serpent's Gambit is the first book of Act II — The Breaking. The cleverness that saved the alliance in Act I meets an opponent who is smarter, more patient, and more terrifying than anything they've faced. Valdremor doesn't fight wars. He engineers them.</p>

<p>For fans of <i>The Lies of Locke Lamora</i>, <i>The Blade Itself</i>, and <i>The Poppy War</i> — a series where the most dangerous weapon is intelligence, the most devastating attack is patience, and the hardest thing a spy can learn is that being clever isn't the same as being wise.</p>

<p><i>The serpent coiled. The gambit played. And somewhere in the silence, the storm gathers.</i></p>

<p><b>Book 5 of 12 in the <i>Aztec Samurai Adventures</i> series. From Ketan Shukla, published by Metronagon.</b></p>
