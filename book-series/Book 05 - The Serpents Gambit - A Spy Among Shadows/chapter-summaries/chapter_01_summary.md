# Chapter 1 Summary — THE SERPENT'S PLAN

**POV:** Kaelen

Kaelen and Zariel navigate the underground river system beneath Relicara's mountain fortress. Kaelen reveals the full counter-trap: Jagren/Skyren visible from the west, Kaelen/Zariel covert from below. The plan is called the Serpent's Gambit — strike from where you aren't seen.

They surface inside the fortress's lower levels. Through a ventilation grate, they see Valdremor — thin, gaunt, crystal eye glowing violet — standing before a terrified Relicara.

**Key Events:** Underground river infiltration, plan layers revealed, fortress entered through drainage, Valdremor first seen through grate.

**Cliffhanger:** "Architect. I wasn't expecting—" "No. You weren't." The game has a new player, and the new player is terrifying.
