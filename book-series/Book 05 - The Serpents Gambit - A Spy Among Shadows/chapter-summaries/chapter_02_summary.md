# Chapter 2 Summary — RELICARA'S CATHEDRAL

**POV:** Relicara (Villain)

First Relicara POV. Her fortress is a hollowed-out mountain — a cathedral of 743 stolen artifacts. She walks the halls at midnight touching each glass case. She holds two sacred relics: the Bone Compass and the Tide-Glass.

She visits Rainara in a dehydration cell — absorption crystals stripping all moisture. Rainara is defiant: "I'm not a thing." Relicara checks her defenses, notes the drainage system as a minor vulnerability but doesn't reinforce it.

**Key Events:** Cathedral described, Relicara's obsessive personality established, Rainara's imprisonment shown, drainage vulnerability noted.

**Cliffhanger:** "Come and get her. I'll be waiting." The serpent is already in the water.
