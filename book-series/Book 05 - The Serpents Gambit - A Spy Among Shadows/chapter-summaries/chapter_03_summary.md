# Chapter 3 Summary — THE DIVERSION

**POV:** Skyren

Skyren circles above on Cielovar, cataloguing the fortress layout — 120 guards, 15-minute patrols, defense optimized for infiltration prevention. She transmits intelligence to Kaelen. Jagren leads the visible approach at the western gate, challenging guards to single combat, dodging crossbow bolts — pure theater.

Skyren spots an unexpected carriage from the east with Dominion elite guard escort. The eastern gate opens with a command-level override — someone with authority above Relicara.

**Key Events:** Fortress reconnaissance, Jagren's theatrical diversion, guards reinforced on western wall, unknown VIP carriage arrives from east.

**Cliffhanger:** "UNKNOWN VIP INCOMING. NOT PART OF THE PLAN." The diversion is working — but the plan didn't include a carriage from the east.
