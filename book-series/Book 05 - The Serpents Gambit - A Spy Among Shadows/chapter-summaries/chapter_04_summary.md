# Chapter 4 Summary — THE ARCHITECT ARRIVES

**POV:** Kaelen

Kaelen and Zariel surface inside the fortress and witness the exchange through a grate. Valdremor — thin, crystal eye, impeccably dressed — demands the relics. Relicara protests: "The relics are mine." Valdremor: "You were promised nothing. You are a warehouse. You always were."

He takes the Tide-Glass. He deliberately leaves the Starshard: "Let them take one relic. I want to see what they do with it." Zariel identifies Valdremor as the mind behind everything — ash-oaths, Gate activation, mirror-portals.

**Key Events:** Valdremor takes Tide-Glass, leaves Starshard deliberately, Relicara's identity shattered, Zariel identifies the Architect's significance.

**Cliffhanger:** The operational landscape has changed. The enemy wants the alliance to succeed — which means they're not succeeding. They're participating.
