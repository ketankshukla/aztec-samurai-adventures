# Chapter 5 Summary — VALDREMOR TAKES COMMAND

**POV:** Relicara (Villain)

Extended Relicara POV after Valdremor's departure. Her identity collapses — "You are not a collector. You are a warehouse." She sits on the floor of her cathedral, grieving for twenty years of obsessive labor revealed as someone else's property.

She checks her defenses, dispatches guards to inspect the drainage system (they find nothing — Kaelen already passed through). The anger begins building — not at the alliance but at Valdremor, who took her identity.

**Key Events:** Relicara's identity crisis, grief converting to fury, drainage check finds nothing, the collector becomes something harder and more dangerous.

**Cliffhanger:** The most dangerous threat isn't the army at the gate or the infiltrators in the tunnels. It's the truth. And the truth has already breached her walls.
