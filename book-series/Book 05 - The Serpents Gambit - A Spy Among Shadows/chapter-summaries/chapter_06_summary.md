# Chapter 6 Summary — THE INFILTRATION

**POV:** Kaelen

Kaelen and Zariel navigate to Rainara's cell on sub-level two. Shadow-step holds well — no blood-magic interference. Kaelen picks the seven-pin lock in seven seconds, bypassing the magical ward by using no magic.

Rainara is dehydrated but unbroken: "About damn time." She immediately begins drawing moisture from the walls and a water pipe in the ceiling. Her power floods back. She leads the team toward the relic vault, creating fog that blinds guards.

**Key Events:** Cell lock picked mechanically, Rainara freed, water-knot magic restored, fog used to bypass guards, team moves toward Starshard vault.

**Cliffhanger:** "Remind me never to make you angry." "You haven't seen angry yet." They reach the artifact vault.
