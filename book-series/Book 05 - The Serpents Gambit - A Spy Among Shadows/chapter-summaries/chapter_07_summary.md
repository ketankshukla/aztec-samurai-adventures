# Chapter 7 Summary — RAINARA UNLEASHED

**POV:** Rainara

First extended Rainara POV. Her water-knot magic roars back — she feels every drop of liquid within a hundred feet. She dissolves the vault's magical wards by pushing water into the crystal conduits that power them. "Water defeats almost everything eventually."

Kaelen takes the Starshard despite knowing Valdremor left it deliberately. Alarms blare — Rainara freezes them silent. The escape proceeds through the drainage system with Rainara parting the underground river like a road.

**Key Events:** Rainara's power fully demonstrated, vault wards dissolved by water, Starshard taken, alarms frozen, escape through underground river.

**Cliffhanger:** Relicara's voice echoes: "MY COLLECTION!" The extraction worked. But it was almost too clean.
