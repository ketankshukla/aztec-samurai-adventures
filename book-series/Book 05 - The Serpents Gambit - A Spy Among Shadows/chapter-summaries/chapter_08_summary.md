# Chapter 8 Summary — THE RELIC TAKEN

**POV:** Kaelen

The extraction proceeds flawlessly — too flawlessly. Kaelen plants false intelligence documents (Operation Southstrike) at the drainage exit. Skyren confirms clear skies and no pursuit. Valdremor's escort departed east during the extraction, indifferent to the rescue.

Meanwhile, Relicara snaps. She activates the fortress self-destruct — magical charges at load-bearing points. Ten-minute countdown. Staff evacuates. The Cathedral collapses — 743 artifacts buried. Relicara walks out coated in dust.

**Key Events:** False intel planted, extraction completed, Relicara self-destructs the Cathedral, mountain collapses, fourth villain broken not killed.

**Cliffhanger:** "If I can't own the world, I'll watch it burn." Relicara walks north toward Valdremor. More dangerous for the breaking.
