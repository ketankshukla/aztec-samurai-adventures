# Chapter 9 Summary — RELICARA BREAKS

**POV:** Relicara (Villain)

Extended POV on Relicara's aftermath. She stands in the dust of Mount Sevralis feeling nothing — not numbness but the permanent removal of the capacity to feel about things revealed as never hers. She dismisses her staff with full severance.

She walks north toward the Dominion capital — alone, empty-handed, carrying only anger at Valdremor. The anger ignites three miles into the walk. Twenty years of identity built on a lie. She will find the Architect and make him see her.

**Key Events:** Cathedral destroyed, staff dismissed, Relicara walks alone toward capital, anger ignites, hunting Valdremor.

**Cliffhanger:** The most dangerous thing in the world is a lie that lasted twenty years. Relicara walks north with patient fury.
