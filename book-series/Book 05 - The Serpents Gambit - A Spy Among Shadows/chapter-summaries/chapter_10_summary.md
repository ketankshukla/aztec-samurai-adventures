# Chapter 10 Summary — THE RETURN

**POV:** Itzil

The rescue team returns. Itzil meets them — sees Rainara for the first time (tall, fierce, magnificent). Kaelen reports: Valdremor left the Starshard deliberately. Rainara describes Valdremor: "The others want power. He IS power."

Itzil hugs Kaelen — brief, tight, the first time. "Don't make it weird." His own words from Book 1 thrown back at him. The celebration that evening features the full team. Kaelen stands at the edge. Itzil finds him there.

**Key Events:** Team returns, Rainara introduced to alliance, Valdremor intelligence debriefed, first Itzil-Kaelen hug, celebration.

**Cliffhanger:** Two people stand at the celebration's edge and feel warmth that has no name. The Starless Crown grows above.
