# Chapter 11 Summary — RAINARA'S FURY

**POV:** Rainara

Rainara demonstrates full power to the military council — water walls, ice blades, blinding fog. Three dummies destroyed in four seconds. She's a force multiplier who reshapes terrain. But her anger is personal and consuming.

Kaelen cautions: "Anger of that intensity doesn't sustain — it consumes." They argue — righteous rage vs. tactical patience. Neither is wrong. Itzil assigns Rainara to the liberation campaign to channel the fury into purpose.

**Key Events:** Full power demonstration, council awed, Kaelen identifies anger as tactical risk, Rainara assigned to liberation ops.

**Cliffhanger:** "I will NOT wait while people suffer." She destroys three more dummies. Everyone gives her space.
