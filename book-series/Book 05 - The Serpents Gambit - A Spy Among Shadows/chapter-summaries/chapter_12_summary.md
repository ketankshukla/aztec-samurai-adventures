# Chapter 12 Summary — THE TRACKING SIGIL

**POV:** Amalura

Amalura examines the Starshard through the night. Layer by layer she peels back the magical signature. Deep inside: a tracking sigil — microscopic, molecular-level, transmitting continuously since Kaelen took it. Valdremor's masterwork.

The alliance base has been compromised for three days. Amalura races to Itzil: "The relic is tracked. Valdremor knows where we are." Emergency meeting convenes. Torvane proposes the counter-deception: use the tracker against Valdremor by moving the relic to a decoy base.

**Key Events:** Tracking sigil discovered, three days of compromised location, emergency meeting, four options debated, counter-deception plan adopted.

**Cliffhanger:** "We're playing chess with someone who's been playing longer than we've been alive."
