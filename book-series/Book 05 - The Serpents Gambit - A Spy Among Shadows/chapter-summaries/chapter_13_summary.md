# Chapter 13 Summary — EMERGENCY PROTOCOL

**POV:** Itzil

The alliance evacuates — seven hours to dismantle a base that took three weeks to build. Torvane's modular evacuation protocol converts chaos into a mechanical sequence. The Starshard goes to Greystone decoy base. The real base relocates thirty miles northeast to Thornhaven.

Rainara erases physical evidence of habitation using water-magic. Two-day march through forest terrain. The column reaches Thornhaven — a deep, forested valley accessible through two narrow passes.

**Key Events:** Base evacuated in seven hours, Starshard moved to Greystone decoy, real base relocated to Thornhaven, Rainara erases camp traces, two-day march.

**Cliffhanger:** The evacuation is complete. But the question remains: is Valdremor following the tracker, or watching their real movements?
