# Chapter 14 Summary — VALDREMOR'S MAP

**POV:** Valdremor (Villain)

Valdremor watches the tracking sigil move on his luminous map. He smiles — the first smile in the series: "They found the tracker. Good. Stupid enemies are boring." He doesn't fall for the counter-deception.

He noted the original coordinates during the three-day window BEFORE they moved the relic. The decoy is irrelevant. The original location tells him the region, terrain, and approach routes. He marks a thirty-mile search radius. He begins planning the surgical assault — Book 6's story.

**Key Events:** Valdremor sees through counter-deception, original coordinates noted, thirty-mile search radius marked, assault planning begins.

**Cliffhanger:** "Found you." The Architect begins planning the assault that will destroy the alliance's base in three weeks.
