# Chapter 15 Summary — MIYAKO'S TRAINING

**POV:** Miyako

Miyako trains the combined army — blindfolding Thalendor infantry to teach non-visual coordination, dismounting Pyrrath cavalry to teach fixed-position fighting. Unconventional methods that force each culture to understand the other's disadvantages.

Quiet moment on a hilltop with Kaelen: "There is no home. Just places I haven't left yet." A messenger arrives — Helisar's ash-oath operations have expanded to a new city. Miyako's former home. Her hand finds her blade.

**Key Events:** Cross-cultural combat training, blindfolded infantry drill, Kaelen-Miyako mentor bond, Miyako's home city ash-oathed.

**Cliffhanger:** The war was professional. Now it's personal. The shadow master begins planning the most visible thing she's ever done.
