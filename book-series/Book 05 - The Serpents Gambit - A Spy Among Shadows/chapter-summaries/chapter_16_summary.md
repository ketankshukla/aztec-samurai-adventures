# Chapter 16 Summary — THE RELIC'S POWER

**POV:** Itzil

Itzil tests the Starshard with the Sun-Blade. Tenfold amplification — the golden light erupts, the world goes white. She can see ash-oath threads across the continent. She can break oaths at distance. The power is intoxicating.

Amalura warns: "The relics were scattered for a reason. Too much power attracts the Gate's attention." Using the combination weakens the dimensional barrier. A weapon that is also a liability. That night, Itzil dreams of the Gate — something vast whispers her name.

**Key Events:** Starshard amplification tested (10x), ash-oath threads visible, distance oath-breaking possible, Gate resonance warning, Itzil's Gate dream.

**Cliffhanger:** The Starshard is glowing in its container — responding to something she can't see. The Gate is listening.
