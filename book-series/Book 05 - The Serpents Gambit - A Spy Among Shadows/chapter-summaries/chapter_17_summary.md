# Chapter 17 Summary — ZARIEL'S INTELLIGENCE

**POV:** Zariel

Zariel maps the Dominion's internal power structure for the council. Key insight: the villains don't all agree. Relicara resented being used. Valdremor considers Volzentar emotionally undisciplined. Nightshade's loyalty is professional, not personal.

He proposes a covert disinformation campaign through three channels: captured communication crystals, turned agents, and potentially Relicara herself. "We can't out-fight them. But we might be able to out-think them. Divide and corrode."

**Key Events:** Dominion power structure mapped, internal fractures identified, disinformation campaign proposed and approved, Relicara identified as potential asset.

**Cliffhanger:** "Smarter, yes. But is he wiser?" The seeds of doubt are planted in the Dominion's bloodstream.
