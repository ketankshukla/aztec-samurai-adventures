# Chapter 18 Summary — SOLKREN'S FORGE

**POV:** Itzil

Itzil visits Solkren's forge at midnight. The armorer — large, scarred, barely speaks — is building ward-disruptor housings for Torvane. "Words are your weapon. This is mine."

Solkren reveals: "The Sun-Blade feels different since it manifested. It resonates. Like it's listening." The blade fragments want to be whole. The Sun-Blade is incomplete — pre-Gate material that Solkren is learning to understand. Reforging could unlock greater power.

**Key Events:** Solkren's character explored, ward-disruptor housings built, Sun-Blade resonance revealed, blade incompleteness identified, reforging possibility raised.

**Cliffhanger:** The blade is listening. To what? The question will matter more than anything else in the war.
