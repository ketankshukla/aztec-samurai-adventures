# Chapter 19 Summary — THE DECOY BATTLE

**POV:** Kaelen

A 500-soldier Dominion probe follows the tracking sigil to Greystone Pass. Kaelen is ready — Torvane's traps turn the narrow pass into a killing ground. Pressure charges, directional explosives, ambush from elevation. The probe is destroyed in twelve minutes.

But the probe reported Greystone's position BEFORE attacking. Valdremor now has confirmation. When he determines it's a decoy — and he will — he'll expand the search to find the real base.

**Key Events:** Dominion probe destroyed at Greystone, decoy confirmed working, intercepted communication reveals pre-attack report, time bought but limited.

**Cliffhanger:** "The decoy worked today. It won't work twice. He's learning us faster than we're learning him."
