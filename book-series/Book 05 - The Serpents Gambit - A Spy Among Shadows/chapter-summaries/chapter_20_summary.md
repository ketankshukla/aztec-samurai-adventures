# Chapter 20 Summary — NIGHTSHADE'S OBSESSION

**POV:** Nightshade (Villain)

Nightshade studies the alliance team's bonds — the love that holds them together and makes them unpredictable. She identifies the vulnerability: not Itzil (too resilient) but the bonds themselves. Break the bonds, break the team.

She proposes capturing Amalura — the knowledge-keeper whose mind is worth more than the army. Extraction plan: four operatives, blood-portal, fifteen-minute window during the assault's peak. Portal anchors on a frequency Torvane's network can't detect.

**Key Events:** Alliance bonds analyzed, Amalura identified as capture target, extraction plan finalized, undetectable portal frequency developed.

**Cliffhanger:** "The old woman's mind is worth more than their entire army." Three weeks to the assault.
