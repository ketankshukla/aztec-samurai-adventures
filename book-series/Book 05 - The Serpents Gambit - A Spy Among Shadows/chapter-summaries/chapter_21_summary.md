# Chapter 21 Summary — THE CALM

**POV:** Itzil

A quiet chapter. Itzil and Kaelen share a night watch at Thornhaven's ridgeline. The Starless Crown is visible — growing, more than half complete. Four months until it closes.

They talk about what happens after the war. Kaelen: "Something I've never had." "What?" "A reason to stay in one place." Neither acknowledges what he's saying directly. They lean toward each other but don't touch. "I'm glad you stayed." "So am I."

**Key Events:** Starless Crown measured at 4 months to closure, Itzil-Kaelen night watch conversation, "after the war" discussion, emotional gravity acknowledged indirectly.

**Cliffhanger:** Two people stand at the edge of the world and feel something that has no name. The calm before the storm.
