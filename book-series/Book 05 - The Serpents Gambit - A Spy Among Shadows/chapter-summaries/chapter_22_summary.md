# Chapter 22 Summary — THE ALLIANCE STRENGTHENS

**POV:** Itzil

The alliance rebuilds — new volunteers arriving daily: refugees, deserters, freed ash-oath soldiers. Strength climbing from 7,000 toward 8,500. Neyla reports consistent oath-weakening (12/week, scaling to 30). Torvane's ward-detection network covers five miles. Skyren reports Crown at 40% complete.

Itzil addresses the council: "We're not ready for the final fight. But we're ready for the next one." The alliance is less conventional and more resilient — distributed teams capable of operating behind enemy lines.

**Key Events:** Alliance rebuilding with new recruits, oath-breaking corps scaling, detection network operational, Crown at 40%, Itzil's measured optimism.

**Cliffhanger:** Every person who walks through the perimeter is a vote for hope. Growing, in a war of erasure, is the most revolutionary act possible.
