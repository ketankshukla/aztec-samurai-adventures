# Chapter 23 Summary — VALDREMOR'S PATIENCE

**POV:** Valdremor (Villain)

Valdremor completes his assault plan — precision, not brute force. Surgical strikes on communications, supply lines, escape routes, then the main force hits the base. He briefs Nightshade: "Your objective is the old woman. Everything else is secondary."

He asks Serenthar why the heroes' morale persists. She answers: "Because they love each other. You cannot calculate love." He files it as a variable. If love is their strength, then love is their vulnerability. He gives the order: "Three weeks. Prepare the assault force."

**Key Events:** Assault plan completed, Nightshade briefed on Amalura capture, Serenthar's love insight, Valdremor gives three-week order.

**Cliffhanger:** The most dangerous man in the world plans the destruction of the only people who can stop him — not from malice but from the conviction that mechanisms must be completed.
