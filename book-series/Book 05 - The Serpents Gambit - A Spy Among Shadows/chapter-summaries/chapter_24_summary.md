# Chapter 24 Summary — THE SERPENT COILS

**POV:** Kaelen

Dominion communications go dark overnight — complete blackout on all monitored frequencies. Kaelen recognizes the silence: "Something big is coming. We won't see it until it arrives." Itzil orders maximum alert, increased reconnaissance, emergency evacuation preparation.

The team gathers around a fire — all ten heroes plus Korvain and Amalura on relay. Jagren plays his pipe. Skyren tells stories. Rainara looks at the Crown: "It's getting bigger." No one responds. They all know.

**Key Events:** Dominion communications blackout, Kaelen warns of imminent large-scale action, emergency preparations ordered, full team gathers around fire for possibly the last time.

**Cliffhanger:** The serpent coiled. The gambit played. Somewhere in the silence, the storm gathers. And the team holds the moment — because moments are the only permanent things.
