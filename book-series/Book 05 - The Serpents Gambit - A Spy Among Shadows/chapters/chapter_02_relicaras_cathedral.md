Chapter 2 - RELICARA'S CATHEDRAL

Relicara's fortress was not a fortress. It was a museum — and she was its curator, its architect, its god.

The Cathedral of Collection occupied the interior of Mount Sevralis — a hollowed-out mountain whose natural caverns had been expanded, reinforced, and transformed over two decades into the most extensive private archive of magical artifacts in the known world. The main hall alone was three hundred feet long and a hundred feet high, its walls lined with glass cases that contained relics from civilizations that no longer existed, weapons from wars that no one remembered, art from cultures that had been consumed by the Dominion and preserved only in this space because Relicara had decided they were worth keeping.

She walked the main hall at midnight — a ritual she performed every night, the way a mother checked on sleeping children. Her fingers trailed along the glass cases as she passed, touching each one with the particular tenderness of a person for whom objects were not possessions but relationships.

The Sunfire Medallion — a pre-Gate artifact that could store and release thermal energy. She had acquired it from a merchant in the Southern Reaches who hadn't known what he was selling. It sat in its case on a bed of black velvet, the gold surface catching the phosphorescent light with a warmth that seemed almost alive.

The Bone Compass — one of the seven sacred relics. It pointed not north but toward the nearest source of concentrated magical energy. Relicara had found it in a collapsed temple in the Ashenmere forests, buried under three centuries of root growth. She had spent two months excavating it with her own hands, refusing to let anyone else touch it.

The Tide-Glass — another of the seven. A crystalline sphere that contained what appeared to be a miniature ocean, complete with waves and currents that moved in response to the moon's position. She had taken this one from a rival collector — a transaction that had involved a significant amount of gold and a small amount of poison.

Two of the seven sacred relics. Two. In her collection. In her cathedral. Under her care.

Relicara was not a soldier. She was not a strategist. She was not a politician or a diplomat or a commander. She was a collector — a woman whose identity was built on the fundamental belief that the world's most precious things were safer in her care than in anyone else's. She didn't want to use the relics. She didn't want to weaponize them. She wanted to own them. To preserve them. To ensure that they existed in a state of perfect maintenance and cataloguing that would outlast empires and civilizations and the petty wars that destroyed everything they touched.

The Dominion had given her the resources to build the Cathedral. Volzentar had recognized her talent — the obsessive, detail-oriented genius that made her the world's premier acquirer of magical artifacts — and had funded her operation in exchange for access to her collection when needed. The arrangement was clear: she collected, he consulted. The artifacts remained hers.

That was the understanding. That was the deal.

She descended to the lower levels — the detention wing, where the most recent addition to her collection was housed. Not an artifact — a person. But a person so extraordinary that Relicara had made an exception to her preference for objects.

Rainara's cell was designed for deprivation. The walls were lined with absorption crystals that drew moisture from the air, creating an environment so dry that the stone itself seemed to gasp. No water. No liquid of any kind. The air was arid — desert-dry, the humidity reduced to levels that would desiccate organic material within days. For a water-knot mystic — a person whose power depended on the manipulation of liquids — the cell was a cage built from absence.

Rainara sat in the center of the cell. She was thin — weeks of captivity and dehydration had stripped the excess from her frame, leaving a body that was angular and drawn but fundamentally unbroken. Her dark hair was matted. Her skin was cracked at the lips and knuckles. Her eyes — dark, furious, alive — tracked Relicara's approach with the focused intensity of a predator waiting for an opening.

"You're the most interesting thing I've collected in years," Relicara said. She stood at the cell bars — iron, treated with anti-moisture sigils that prevented condensation. "A living relic. A person whose body is a conduit for one of the fundamental forces of nature."

"I'm not a thing," Rainara said. Her voice was rough — dehydration had stripped it of smoothness, leaving a rasp that carried fury and contempt in equal measure. "And you're not a collector. You're a thief with organizational skills."

Relicara smiled. The insult bounced off her the way all insults bounced — she had long ago decided that other people's opinions of her were irrelevant, because other people didn't understand what she understood: that the world's treasures were fragile, temporary, and doomed to destruction unless someone with the vision and the resources to preserve them took responsibility.

"I prefer 'custodian,'" Relicara said. "The world destroys. I preserve."

"You preserve things in cages. That's not preservation. That's imprisonment."

"Tomato, to-mah-to."

She checked the cell's absorption crystals — each one functioning at optimal capacity, drawing the last traces of moisture from the air with the efficiency of a system designed by someone who understood that the only reliable cage for a water-knot mystic was an environment with nothing to manipulate.

Rainara watched her. The fury in her eyes was constant — not the hot, explosive fury of anger but the cold, sustained fury of a person who had been caged and was planning, with every moment of consciousness, the exact sequence of actions she would perform when the cage opened.

"They'll come for me," Rainara said.

"I know. I'm counting on it." Relicara turned from the cell. Her smile widened — the expression of a collector who had arranged the perfect display and was waiting for the audience to arrive. "The alliance will send their best. They always do. And when they come, I'll be ready."

She climbed back to the main hall. The Cathedral was quiet — the particular quiet of a space designed for contemplation, for reverence, for the appreciation of beauty that existed nowhere else in the world because the world had been too careless to preserve it.

She checked the defenses. Three layers of alarm systems — pressure-sensitive floor panels, motion-detection wards, acoustic monitoring that could detect a whisper at a hundred feet. Guard patrols on fifteen-minute rotations — twenty soldiers per shift, drawn from the Dominion's professional garrison, supplemented by Relicara's personal security force of artifact-handling specialists who were trained to fight as well as they were trained to catalogue.

The main entrance was fortified — reinforced gates, murder holes, a killing corridor that would funnel any attacking force into a space where they could be destroyed at leisure. The secondary entrances were sealed and warded. The tertiary entrances — maintenance corridors, service tunnels, ventilation shafts — were monitored.

The drainage system...

Relicara paused. She looked at the schematic of her fortress — the detailed architectural plans that hung in her office, showing every corridor, every room, every passage in the Cathedral. The drainage system was marked — a network of channels that carried waste water from the fortress to the underground river below.

She had considered the drainage system when designing her defenses. She had decided it was not a significant vulnerability — the channels were narrow, partially submerged, and unpleasant enough to discourage infiltration. She had placed a single alarm ward at the point where the drainage system connected to the fortress's lower levels.

A single alarm ward. Against an alliance that had infiltrated Facility Twelve through a drainage grate and Fortress Ashfall through blood-ward gaps.

She made a note: reinforce drainage security. Tomorrow. Tonight, she had other priorities.

She returned to the main hall. She walked the aisles one more time — touching the glass cases, greeting each artifact, the nightly ritual that was as essential to her wellbeing as sleep or food. The Sunfire Medallion. The Bone Compass. The Tide-Glass. The seven hundred and forty-three other artifacts that constituted her life's work, her identity, her reason for existing.

She paused at the end of the hall. The two sacred relics — the Bone Compass and the Tide-Glass — sat in their cases, side by side, the two most valuable objects in her collection. She touched the glass above them.

"Safe," she whispered. "You're safe with me."

She left the hall. She climbed to her quarters — the uppermost level of the Cathedral, a room with windows that looked out over the Shattered Peaks and the valley below. She checked the defenses one final time through her command console — a crystal-based monitoring system that showed every alarm, every guard, every ward in the fortress.

Everything was perfect. Everything was in place. The Cathedral was secure. The relics were safe. The prisoner was contained.

She smiled.

"Come and get her," she said to the empty room. To the alliance she knew was coming. To the heroes who would walk into her cathedral and discover that the collector was also a trap-builder and the museum was also a cage.

"Come and get her. I'll be waiting."

She extinguished the lights. The Cathedral settled into darkness — the artifacts resting in their cases, the relics glowing faintly with their own internal light, the prisoner in her dry cell staring at the ceiling with eyes that burned with fury and patience and the absolute certainty that rescue was coming.

It was. The serpent was already in the water.
