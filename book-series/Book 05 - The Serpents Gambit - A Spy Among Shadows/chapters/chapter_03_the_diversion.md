Chapter 3 - THE DIVERSION

Skyren loved mornings like this — cold, clear, and full of the particular electricity that preceded violence.

She circled above the Shattered Peaks on Cielovar's back, the golden hawk riding the thermal updrafts that rose from the mountain's sun-warmed face with the effortless grace of a predator in its natural element. The altitude was two thousand feet — high enough to see the fortress's full layout spread below her like an architect's model, low enough to count the guards on the walls and track the patrol routes that moved across the fortress perimeter with the mechanical regularity of a clock's hands.

Relicara's fortress was impressive. Built into the hollowed interior of Mount Sevralis, its external face presented a wall of natural stone interrupted by fortified gates and watchtowers that grew from the mountainside like stone teeth. The main entrance was on the western face — a pair of reinforced gates flanked by murder holes and topped by a crenellated wall that bristled with crossbow positions. The secondary entrances were on the northern and southern faces — smaller, sealed, heavily warded.

Skyren catalogued everything. Guard count: approximately one hundred and twenty, distributed across three shifts of forty. Patrol frequency: fifteen-minute rotations on the walls, twenty-minute rotations at the gates. Armament: standard Dominion military issue — crossbows, short swords, light armor. No sorcerers visible. No heavy equipment. No siege weapons.

The fortress was designed to defend against infiltration, not assault. The guards were watchmen, not warriors. The defenses were alarms and wards, not walls and catapults. Relicara had built a vault, not a castle — a space designed to keep things in rather than keep armies out.

Skyren filed the assessment and transmitted it to Kaelen's signal relay using Torvane's coded pulse system — a series of short and long transmissions that carried compressed intelligence in a format that was indistinguishable from atmospheric static to anyone who didn't know the decryption key.

FORTRESS LAYOUT CONFIRMED. GUARD COUNT 120. PATROL ROTATION 15/20. NO SORCERERS. DEFENSE OPTIMIZED FOR INFILTRATION PREVENTION. MAIN GATE WESTERN FACE. SECONDARY SEALED. DRAINAGE SYSTEM SOUTH FACE — UNGUARDED FROM EXTERIOR.

She banked Cielovar into a wide turn — the hawk responding to the pressure of her left knee with the fluid obedience of a bird that had been translating human intention into avian motion for six years. The turn brought her around the fortress's southern face, where the drainage outflow emerged from the mountain as a modest stream that joined the larger river in the valley below.

Kaelen and Zariel were down there. Somewhere in that stream, navigating the underground river system that fed into the fortress from below. She couldn't see them — the entrance was concealed by overhanging rock and dense vegetation — but she knew they were there because Kaelen had transmitted a position update thirty minutes ago and because Kaelen was never anywhere other than where he said he would be.

She turned north. Jagren's visible approach was assembling in the valley — two hundred fighters from three nations, arrayed in a formation that was deliberately conspicuous. Banners flying. Armor polished. The Thalendor heavy infantry in the center with their mountain-forged pikes, the Pyrrath scouts on the flanks with their desert blades, the alliance fighters filling the gaps with the casual competence of warriors who had been doing this long enough to know the difference between a real assault and theater.

Jagren was at the front. She could see him from two thousand feet — the distinctive posture of a man who had spent his life being noticed and was now channeling that talent into deliberate provocation. He walked ahead of the formation with his sword drawn, his stride the confident, measured pace of a duelist approaching a challenge.

He was good at this. The visible approach required not just physical presence but performance — the ability to project threat and confidence in quantities that would convince the fortress defenders that the main attack was coming from the west. Jagren had been a performer before the war made him a professional. He could project threat the way a lighthouse projected light: consistently, conspicuously, and from a great distance.

The formation reached the fortress's western approach — a cleared area before the main gates that served as a killing field for anyone foolish enough to charge the entrance head-on. Jagren halted the force at the edge of the field and stepped forward alone.

"Relicara!" His voice carried with the projection of a trained orator — clear, confident, designed to reach the wall-top guards and the gate sentries and anyone inside the fortress who was listening. "I am Jagren den Sorath of the Allied Compact! I demand the release of the water-knot mystic Rainara, held unlawfully in your fortress! Surrender her peacefully and we withdraw! Refuse, and we come in!"

The gate guards responded with the professional indifference of soldiers who had been expecting this. Crossbows trained on Jagren's position. A senior officer appeared on the wall above the gate — a woman in Dominion standard armor, her face carrying the bored expression of someone whose daily routine had just been interrupted by a theatrical demand.

"The prisoner is Dominion property," the officer called back. "Your demand is rejected. Withdraw or be engaged."

"Then we're engaged," Jagren said. He didn't charge. He didn't attack. He stood in the killing field with his sword drawn and his stance open and waited — the human equivalent of bait, presenting a target that was too tempting and too exposed to ignore.

The crossbow bolts came. Jagren moved — not retreating but dodging, the lateral movement of a duelist who had spent years perfecting the art of not being where weapons expected him to be. Bolts struck the ground around him. He dodged three, deflected one with his blade, and continued standing in the killing field with the infuriating patience of a man who had all day and was prepared to spend it making the fortress guards waste ammunition.

The visible approach was working. Guards reinforced the western wall. Patrol routes shifted — soldiers pulled from the secondary entrances to reinforce the main gate. The fortress's defensive attention concentrated on the front, exactly as planned.

Skyren transmitted the update: WESTERN WALL REINFORCED. SECONDARY ENTRANCES DEPLETED. DRAINAGE APPROACH CLEAR. GREEN LIGHT FOR INFILTRATION.

Then she saw something that wasn't in the plan.

From the east — from the mountain road that connected Relicara's territory to the Dominion's interior — a carriage was approaching. Not a supply wagon or a military transport. A carriage — ornate, black-lacquered, drawn by four horses and escorted by soldiers whose armor was different from the standard garrison issue. These were elite guard — Dominion personal security forces, the kind that protected senior officials and high-value targets.

Someone important was coming. Uninvited.

Skyren descended — dropping to a thousand feet for a better look. The carriage was closed — curtains drawn, the occupant invisible. The escort numbered twelve soldiers — a significant security detail for a single person. They moved with the coordinated precision of a unit that had been doing this for years.

She transmitted: UNKNOWN VIP INCOMING. CARRIAGE FROM THE EAST. DOMINION ELITE GUARD ESCORT. NOT PART OF THE PLAN.

The response from Kaelen was brief: ACKNOWLEDGED. CONTINUING.

Skyren climbed back to altitude. Below, Jagren continued his performance at the western gate — dodging crossbow bolts, shouting challenges, maintaining the theater that was drawing the fortress's attention away from the drainage system. The two hundred fighters held their position, visible and threatening, the human scenery of a diversion that was working perfectly.

Except for the carriage.

Skyren tracked it. The carriage reached the fortress's eastern approach — a secondary gate that had been sealed and warded. As it approached, the gate opened. Not by the guards' decision — the wards deactivated autonomously, responding to something the carriage or its occupant carried. A command override. The kind of authority that superseded local security.

The carriage entered the fortress. The eastern gate sealed behind it. The wards reactivated.

Whoever was inside that carriage had the authority to open Relicara's fortress like a door, without permission, without announcement, without the formalities that even senior Dominion officials observed when entering a subordinate's territory.

Skyren had been a hawk rider for six years. She had spent those years developing instincts about threat and danger that operated faster than conscious thought. Those instincts were currently screaming.

She transmitted one more message: VIP ENTERED FORTRESS. EASTERN GATE. COMMAND-LEVEL OVERRIDE. THIS IS NOT A STANDARD VISITOR. RECOMMEND EXTREME CAUTION.

Then she climbed. Higher. Into the cold, thin air where the golden hawk could see everything and nothing could see her. She watched the fortress below — the western gate where Jagren performed, the eastern gate where the carriage had entered, the drainage system where Kaelen and Zariel were navigating toward a situation that had just become significantly more complicated.

The diversion was working. The infiltration was proceeding. The plan was on track.

But the plan hadn't included a carriage from the east. And Skyren's instincts — the instincts that had kept her alive through magical storms and lightning strikes and crash landings — were telling her that the carriage changed everything.

She circled. She watched. She waited.

The hawk rider's job was eyes. And the eyes were seeing something that made the rest of the body want to fly in the opposite direction.
