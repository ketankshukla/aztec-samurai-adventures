Chapter 6 - THE INFILTRATION

Kaelen moved through the Cathedral's lower levels with the fluid precision of water finding cracks in stone, and Zariel followed with the determined dignity of a man who refused to let a sewer diminish his professional bearing.

The fortress's interior was a maze of corridors, stairwells, and chambers — the expanded natural caverns of Mount Sevralis connected by constructed passages that linked the various functional areas of Relicara's operation. Storage on the lowest levels. Processing and cataloguing on the middle levels. The main hall and command center above. The detention wing — where Rainara was held — on sub-level two, eastern wing.

Shadow-step was active. Kaelen's outline blurred at the edges — the perceptual erasure extending to Zariel in a bubble of unremarkability that made both men invisible to the guards who passed within feet of their position. The technique was holding well — the Cathedral's interior lacked the blood-magic saturation that had degraded the shadow-step at Fortress Ashfall. Relicara's security was conventional: guards, wards, alarms. Not the magical intensity that challenged perceptual manipulation.

They ascended through a service stairwell — narrow, unlit, the kind of passage used by maintenance staff rather than guards. Kaelen's memorized map placed them on sub-level three. One more level to the detention wing.

A patrol passed — two guards, moving with the professional rhythm of soldiers on a routine rotation. They walked within four feet of Kaelen and Zariel, pressed against the stairwell wall. The guards' eyes slid over them — registered nothing, dismissed everything, the perceptual erasure performing exactly as designed.

Sub-level two. The eastern wing opened before them — a corridor of reinforced doors, each one sealed with conventional locks and ward-sigils. The detention wing was modest by Dominion standards — Relicara's fortress was designed for artifacts, not prisoners. The cells were repurposed storage rooms, hastily converted with bars and locks when Rainara's capture created the need for a detention facility.

Kaelen counted doors. Third from the stairwell, eastern side. Rainara's cell.

The door was iron — reinforced, sealed with a mechanical lock and a ward-sigil that would trigger an alarm if the door was opened without the proper key. The ward was standard — a proximity sensor that detected unauthorized magical signatures within five feet of the lock.

Kaelen didn't use magic. He used lockpicks.

The mechanical lock was a seven-pin tumbler — sophisticated by civilian standards, amateur by infiltration standards. Kaelen's picks found the pins in sequence — the tactile feedback of each pin setting transmitted through the steel tools to his fingertips with the precision of a musician reading a keyboard. Seven pins. Seven seconds.

The lock clicked. The door opened. The ward — designed to detect magical intrusion — remained silent because no magic had been used.

The cell was dry. Aggressively, deliberately dry — the absorption crystals in the walls drawing moisture from the air with the systematic efficiency of a system designed to deny a water-knot mystic any medium for her power. The air was arid — desert-dry, the humidity stripped to levels that made breathing uncomfortable and skin crack.

Rainara sat in the center of the cell on a stone bench. She was thinner than her intelligence photographs — weeks of captivity and dehydration had stripped the excess from her frame, leaving a body that was angular and drawn but fundamentally unbroken. Her dark hair was matted. Her lips were cracked. Her skin was dry to the point of flaking.

But her eyes. Her eyes were alive — dark, furious, burning with the concentrated fury of a person who had been caged and had spent every moment of captivity planning what she would do when the cage opened.

She saw Kaelen. She saw Zariel. She assessed them in one second — the scout's shadow-step blur, the diplomat's waterlogged elegance, the lockpicks in Kaelen's hand.

"About damn time," she said.

"You're welcome," Kaelen replied.

"I'm not thanking you until I'm out."

"Fair."

He entered the cell. Zariel followed, closing the door behind them to maintain the illusion of an undisturbed detention wing. Kaelen assessed Rainara's condition — dehydrated, weakened, but mobile. She could walk. She could move fast if needed.

"Can you use your abilities?" he asked.

"Get me near water and find out."

"There's no water in this cell."

"There's water everywhere. In the stone. In the air — what little is left of it. In your bodies." She looked at them with the particular attention of a person whose perception of the world was fundamentally different from everyone else's — a person who saw not objects and surfaces but the liquid content of everything around her. "There's moisture in the walls — the absorption crystals reduce it but don't eliminate it. There's condensation in the corridor outside. There's a water pipe running through the ceiling — supply line for the upper levels."

"The pipe is enough?"

"The pipe is a river."

Kaelen filed the information. Rainara's power was not eliminated by dehydration — it was suppressed. Give her access to any liquid, and the suppression would end with the dramatic finality of a dam breaking.

"Here's the situation," he said. "Jagren's team is diverting at the western gate. We entered through the drainage system. We extract you through the same route — underground river, surface three miles south."

"And the relic?"

Kaelen paused. Rainara's eyes were sharp — sharper than they had any right to be after weeks of captivity. She knew about the Starshard. She knew it was here.

"Valdremor left it behind on purpose," Kaelen said. "He wants us to take it."

"Valdremor." Rainara's expression shifted — the fury modulating into something more complex. Recognition. Understanding. Fear, held at a distance. "He came. I heard his voice through the walls. Even the stone was afraid of him."

"You know him?"

"I know what he is. The Architect. The mind behind the Dominion's magical infrastructure. If Volzentar is the emperor, Valdremor is the engineer. He designed the ash-oath system. He designed the Gate's activation sequence. He designed the mirror-portal network." She paused. "He designed the cage I'm sitting in. The absorption crystals — their specific frequency, their arrangement, the calibration that makes them effective against water-knot magic specifically — that's his work. This cell was built for me before I was captured."

The implication settled. The cell had been prepared in advance. Rainara's capture was not opportunistic — it was planned. She had been targeted, acquired, and imprisoned in a facility designed specifically for her containment.

"We take the Starshard," Kaelen said. The decision was made — not impulsively but with the calculated acceptance of a man who understood that sometimes the only option was the trap and the only strategy was to walk into it with open eyes. "Its power is too valuable to leave. If Valdremor wants us to have it, we'll figure out why later. Right now, we move."

He opened the cell door. The corridor was clear — the patrol rotation leaving a six-minute window before the next pass. Rainara stepped out of the cell and immediately began drawing moisture from the environment.

The change was instantaneous. The dry, cracked woman who had been sitting on a stone bench in a dehydration cell transformed — her body absorbing moisture from the walls, the air, the condensation on the corridor's stone surfaces. Color returned to her skin. Her lips healed. Her posture straightened — the angular, drawn frame filling out as the water restored what the absorption crystals had taken.

She reached for the ceiling. The water pipe — the supply line that carried water from the fortress's reservoir to the upper levels — ran through the stone above them. Rainara's hand extended, fingers spread, and the pipe responded. The metal groaned. The water inside — gallons of it, pressurized, flowing — answered her call like an old friend.

"Now," she said. Her voice was different — stronger, fuller, carrying the particular resonance of a person reconnecting with the fundamental force that defined them. "Let's go get that relic."

They moved. Through the detention wing, up to the main level, toward the artifact vault where the Starshard waited. Kaelen led — shadow-step active, navigating from memory. Zariel followed. Rainara walked between them with the contained power of a person who was drawing strength from every molecule of moisture in the fortress and was approaching full capacity with terrifying speed.

Guards appeared at the corridor junction ahead — two, responding to a patrol rotation, moving toward their position with the professional cadence of soldiers on routine.

Rainara acted before Kaelen could signal. She raised her hand — a casual gesture, the way a person might wave at a passing acquaintance — and the moisture in the air between them and the guards condensed. Not into water — into fog. A dense, opaque cloud that filled the corridor from wall to wall and ceiling to floor, reducing visibility to zero in one second.

The guards walked into the fog. They couldn't see. They couldn't navigate. They stumbled — disoriented, reaching for walls that their hands couldn't find, calling to each other with the confused urgency of soldiers whose environment had just become incomprehensible.

Kaelen, Zariel, and Rainara walked past them. Through the fog — which parted around Rainara like a curtain being drawn aside — and into the corridor beyond. The fog closed behind them. The guards continued stumbling.

"Remind me never to make you angry," Kaelen said.

Rainara looked at him. The fury in her eyes — the concentrated, weeks-long fury of a woman who had been caged and dehydrated and treated like an artifact — blazed with an intensity that made the shadow-step's perceptual erasure seem like a parlor trick.

"You haven't seen angry yet," she said.

They reached the artifact vault.
