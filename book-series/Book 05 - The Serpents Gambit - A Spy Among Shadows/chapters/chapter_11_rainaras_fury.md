Chapter 11 - RAINARA'S FURY

The training ground learned to fear Rainara on her second day with the alliance.

She stood at the center of the practice field — a cleared area south of camp where Miyako conducted her daily combat exercises — and demonstrated her full power to the military council with the controlled fury of a person who had spent weeks in a dehydration cell and was not yet finished being angry about it.

The demonstration began with water. She drew it from the air — condensing atmospheric moisture into visible streams that flowed between her fingers like liquid silver. The streams thickened. Grew. Became torrents that she shaped with gestures — a raised hand creating a wall of water six feet high, a sweeping arm converting the wall into a horizontal cascade that struck the practice dummies with enough force to shatter the wooden frames.

Three dummies destroyed in four seconds. The military council — Itzil, Brennan, Sethara, the senior officers — watched with expressions that ranged from impressed to alarmed.

Then ice. Rainara froze the water mid-air — the liquid crystallizing instantaneously, the molecular structure rearranging at her command. Ice blades formed — sharp, transparent, spinning in the air like thrown daggers. She directed them with her fingers — each blade finding a target with the guided precision of weapons that could think.

Then fog. A gesture — both hands spreading outward — and the air between the council and the training ground filled with mist so dense that visibility dropped to zero. The council couldn't see. Couldn't navigate. The fog was thick enough to muffle sound, creating a sensory void that would disorient any combatant caught inside.

Then the fog lifted. Rainara stood in the center of the field, surrounded by the wreckage of practice dummies, ice blades embedded in the ground around her like a crown of frozen thorns. The air was wet — saturated with the moisture she had drawn and shaped and weaponized.

"Questions?" she said.

The council was silent for a moment. Then Brennan — the mountain commander whose stoicism was legendary — said: "How many soldiers can you replace?"

"I'm not a replacement for soldiers. I'm a force multiplier. Put me on a battlefield and I change the environment — flood corridors, freeze chokepoints, blind formations. Your soldiers fight better when the terrain works for them. I make the terrain work for them."

The assessment was accurate — and strategically significant. Rainara's power was not combat in the conventional sense. It was environmental control — the ability to reshape the physical conditions of an engagement in the alliance's favor. Combined with Torvane's engineering, Miyako's shadow techniques, and Itzil's Sun-Blade, Rainara added a dimension to the alliance's capabilities that the Dominion would have to account for in every future engagement.

But the demonstration had revealed something else. Something that the council noticed and chose not to address publicly.

Rainara was angry. Not the professional anger of a soldier committed to a cause — the personal, burning, all-consuming anger of a person who had been wronged and was using the cause as a vehicle for vengeance. Every ice blade she threw carried the force of weeks of captivity. Every water wall she raised carried the weight of the dehydration cell. The power was magnificent. The fury behind it was concerning.

Kaelen raised the concern in private — after the demonstration, in the command tent, with Itzil and Zariel present.

"She's too angry," he said. "Anger of that intensity doesn't sustain — it consumes. She'll push too hard, take too many risks, and eventually the fury will override the judgment."

"She has every right to be angry," Itzil said.

"Rights aren't the issue. Effectiveness is. An angry warrior is a predictable warrior. Predictable warriors get killed — and get the people around them killed."

The assessment was delivered with Kaelen's characteristic directness — the scout's ability to identify vulnerability without judgment. He wasn't criticizing Rainara. He was identifying a tactical risk that needed to be managed.

"I'll talk to her," Itzil said.

"She won't listen to a talk. She needs time. Time and a target that gives her fury direction."

"The liberation campaign."

"Exactly. Channel the anger into the mission. Give her ash-oath targets — the facilities where people are being enslaved. Let her destroy them. The anger serves the cause instead of consuming the person."

The strategy was sound — the redirection of destructive emotion into constructive action, the same principle that had guided Jagren's recovery after Ashfall. Give the fury a purpose. Let the burning fuel the work rather than the person.

Itzil assigned Rainara to the liberation campaign's advance team — the first wave of oath-breaking operations that would target Dominion ash-oath facilities behind enemy lines. The assignment was tactical: Rainara's water-knot magic could incapacitate guards, breach facilities, and create extraction corridors without the direct combat that risked alliance casualties.

Rainara accepted the assignment with the fierce satisfaction of a person who had been given permission to do what they wanted to do anyway. "Every day we wait, more people are enslaved," she said. "I will NOT wait while people suffer."

Kaelen cautioned patience. The argument was brief and intense — Rainara's righteous rage against Kaelen's tactical patience. Neither was wrong.

"You plan," Rainara said finally. "I'll prepare. But I will not sit in this camp and train while fifty thousand people in Sunhaven have forgotten their names."

She walked to the training ground and destroyed three more practice dummies with water blades. Everyone gave her space.

Neyla watched from the medical pavilion. The healer's assessment was different from the military council's — she saw not a weapon but a wound. Rainara's fury was the symptom. The injury underneath — the weeks of captivity, the dehydration, the helplessness of a powerful person rendered powerless — was the disease.

"She'll burn out," Neyla told Miyako. "The anger is sustaining her now, but anger is a finite fuel. When it runs out, she'll crash."

"Then we make sure someone is there to catch her."

"Someone?"

Miyako's grey eyes held something that might have been amusement. "She seems to listen to the young swordsman. Jagren. He has experience with fury that transforms into something better."

Neyla filed the observation. The dynamics of the alliance — the relationships, the connections, the invisible bonds that held ten people together against an empire — were becoming more complex with every new member. Rainara added power. She also added volatility.

The alliance was stronger. The alliance was also more fragile.

Both things were true. Both things would matter.
