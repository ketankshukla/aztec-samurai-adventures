Chapter 13 - EMERGENCY PROTOCOL

The evacuation began at noon and was complete by sunset — seven hours to dismantle a base that had taken three weeks to build.

Itzil stood at the command tent's entrance and watched the alliance move. Ten thousand soldiers, plus support staff, medical personnel, and the accumulated infrastructure of a military operation — all of it flowing north along the forest roads with the controlled urgency of an army that had learned, through Fortress Ashfall and its aftermath, that speed was the difference between survival and catastrophe.

The process was Torvane's masterwork. The engineer had designed the evacuation protocol during the base's construction — pre-packed supply crates, modular tent systems that collapsed in minutes, predetermined load orders that assigned every piece of equipment to a specific wagon in a specific position in the convoy. The protocol converted the chaotic process of breaking camp into a mechanical sequence that any soldier could execute without thinking.

"Twelve minutes per section," Torvane reported, his instruments tracking the evacuation's progress with the precision of a conductor managing an orchestra. "We're ahead of schedule. The medical pavilion is loaded. Supply depot is seventy percent packed. Command infrastructure is last — we pull it when everyone else is moving."

The Starshard was already gone — transported to Greystone Pass six hours earlier by a team of fifty soldiers under Jagren's command. The decoy base at Greystone was being populated with the skeleton defense force that would maintain the illusion of a full allied position while the real base relocated to a new hidden location thirty miles northeast.

Kaelen had selected the new position — a forested valley called Thornhaven, accessible only through two narrow passes that could be defended by small forces and concealed by the dense canopy that would prevent aerial observation. The position was defensible, hidden, and unknown to anyone outside the alliance's command staff.

The debate about the tracking sigil had consumed the morning. Four options discussed, argued, refined. The consensus that emerged was Torvane's fourth option — the counter-deception — augmented by Kaelen's intelligence perspective and Zariel's diplomatic input.

The plan had layers. First layer: move the Starshard to Greystone, drawing Valdremor's tracking to the decoy. Second layer: evacuate the real base to Thornhaven, a position the sigil couldn't reveal. Third layer: rig the decoy with Torvane's traps and monitoring equipment, so that any Dominion probe sent to investigate would be destroyed and its intelligence harvested.

"We're not just hiding," Itzil had told the council. "We're converting his weapon into ours. Every piece of intelligence we gather from the decoy tells us about Valdremor's methods. Every probe he sends tells us about his force disposition. The tracker becomes our intelligence source."

The strategy was sound. But it depended on a critical assumption: that Valdremor would follow the tracker to Greystone rather than anticipating the counter-deception and targeting the real base at Thornhaven.

The assumption was, by everyone's admission, uncertain. Valdremor anticipated everything. The Architect's mind operated at a level that made conventional strategic analysis feel like children playing with blocks.

"We're doing our best," Kaelen had said. "Our best might not be good enough against this opponent. But it's what we have."

The evacuation proceeded. Section by section, the base disassembled — tents collapsing, wagons loading, the infrastructure of military life folding into portable components that could be transported and reassembled. The soldiers moved with the practiced efficiency of people who had done this before and would do it again and who understood that the ability to move quickly was as important as the ability to fight effectively.

Rainara contributed. The water-knot mystic walked the base's perimeter and systematically erased the physical evidence of habitation — using her power to redirect streams across abandoned fire pits, to saturate ground that had been compacted by foot traffic, to encourage plant growth that would conceal the paths and clearings that thousands of people had created over three weeks. Within hours, the base looked like it had been abandoned for months rather than hours.

"Water remembers," Rainara said when Itzil commented on the thoroughness. "It remembers every footprint, every fire, every trace of human presence. I'm just helping it forget."

By sunset, the base was gone. The clearing that had housed ten thousand people was a forest clearing again — unremarkable, unoccupied, the human presence erased by water and time and the particular magic of a woman who could make the landscape cooperate.

The convoy moved north. Thirty miles to Thornhaven — a march that would take two days through forest terrain, the column moving in segments to minimize visibility and distribute the impact on the narrow roads.

Itzil walked with the command section — the headquarters staff, the signal relay equipment, the portable command infrastructure that allowed her to manage the army while moving. The Sun-Blade was at her hip, its warmth a constant comfort. The Starshard was at Greystone — thirty miles south, in a fortified decoy base, transmitting its tracking signal to Valdremor's luminous map.

She felt exposed. Not physically — the forest provided concealment, the march discipline prevented noise, the scouts reported clear routes. Exposed in the strategic sense. The alliance was between positions — the old base abandoned, the new base not yet established. For two days, they were a column on a road rather than a force in a fortress. Vulnerable.

"Two days," Kaelen said. He walked beside her — the scout's natural position, close enough for conversation, far enough for independence. "Two days of exposure. Then we're at Thornhaven and the new base is established."

"Two days is a long time."

"It is. But Valdremor's tracker is pointing at Greystone, not at us. If he moves against the decoy, it buys us time. If he anticipates the counter-deception and targets our march column..." Kaelen paused. "Then we have a bigger problem than base location."

"Comforting."

"I don't do comforting. I do accurate."

She almost smiled. The exchange was familiar — the pattern of interaction that had developed between them over months of war, the professional rapport that was becoming something else with the gradual, inevitable momentum of two objects in mutual orbit.

The march continued through the night. The forest closed around the column — dark, cold, the autumn trees stripped of leaves and providing only skeletal concealment. The soldiers marched in silence — the discipline that Miyako had trained into them converting a noisy army into a quiet one, the sounds of ten thousand people reduced to the soft rustle of equipment and the muffled impact of boots on forest floor.

Dawn found them fifteen miles north. Halfway to Thornhaven. The column paused for a four-hour rest — soldiers sleeping in shifts, the perimeter guarded by scouts who circled the camp with the silent efficiency of predators protecting a herd.

Itzil didn't sleep. She sat in the command section and reviewed the intelligence that Skyren's aerial reconnaissance was providing — reports on Dominion troop movements, patrol routes, the disposition of forces that might threaten the column's route.

The Dominion was quiet. Too quiet, Kaelen would say — the silence that preceded storms. But the silence held, and the column rested, and the march resumed at noon.

By sunset of the second day, they reached Thornhaven.

The valley was everything Kaelen had promised — deep, forested, accessible only through two narrow passes that could be defended by fifty soldiers against ten times their number. The canopy was dense — old-growth forest, the trees tall enough and thick enough to prevent observation from above. A river ran through the valley floor, providing water. The terrain was level enough for a camp, elevated enough for defense.

The base began to take shape. Tents went up. Perimeter defenses were established. Torvane's signal relay equipment was deployed. The command tent was erected at the valley's center — the headquarters from which Itzil would direct the alliance's next phase.

The evacuation was complete. The counter-deception was in place. The alliance was hidden.

But the question remained — the question that sat at the back of every strategist's mind like a splinter that couldn't be extracted.

Was Valdremor following the tracker to Greystone? Or was he watching the alliance's real movements with the patient, terrifying omniscience of a man who had anticipated every possible response to every possible action?

The answer would come. It always came. And when it did, the alliance would learn whether their best was good enough against an opponent who had been playing this game longer than any of them had been alive.

The Starless Crown glittered above Thornhaven — visible even through the canopy, the void where stars should have been growing larger every night.

The clock ticked. The game continued. And somewhere in the Dominion capital, the Architect was smiling.
