Chapter 16 - THE RELIC'S POWER

The Starshard changed everything about the Sun-Blade, and the change frightened Itzil more than any battle.

She stood in the testing ground at Thornhaven — a clearing that Torvane had designated for magical experimentation, ringed with ward-stones that contained the energy released during tests and prevented it from affecting the main camp. The Starshard sat on a stone pedestal at the clearing's center, brought from Greystone for a single day of testing before being returned to the decoy base.

Itzil held the Sun-Blade. The golden light was steady — the resting glow that the weapon maintained when activated but not directed. The warmth was familiar — the constant, reassuring heat that had been her companion since the weapon first manifested in her hand at the Sundrift temple.

She stepped toward the Starshard. Five feet. The blade's light intensified — brightening from a glow to a blaze, the golden luminescence increasing in proportion to her proximity to the relic. Four feet. The warmth became heat. Three feet. The blade sang — a harmonic vibration that she felt not in her hand but in her chest, in her bones, in the deep structures of her body where the Sun-Blade's magic interfaced with her physiology.

Two feet. She touched the Starshard with her free hand.

The world went white.

The amplification was instantaneous and overwhelming. The Sun-Blade's output — already formidable, already capable of cutting through Dominion defenses and breaking ash-oaths at close range — multiplied tenfold. The golden light erupted from the blade in a column that punched through the ward-stone perimeter and illuminated the forest for a quarter mile in every direction. Trees cast sharp shadows. The ground brightened to noon intensity. The soldiers in the camp turned toward the clearing with the alarmed expressions of people who had just seen the sun appear at ground level.

The power was intoxicating. Itzil felt it flood through her — the amplified sun-magic filling every channel, every pathway, every conduit that connected her consciousness to the blade's ancient mechanism. She could feel things she had never felt before. The ash-oaths — the crimson bindings that enslaved people across the continent — were visible to her. Not metaphorically — literally visible, faint crimson threads stretching from every ash-oathed person toward the Great Gate, a web of stolen consciousness that spanned the continent and converged on the Dominion capital.

She could reach them. The amplified Sun-Blade could project enough concentrated light to follow the threads — to reach across miles and touch the bindings with sun-magic that would weaken them, crack them, potentially break them. Ash-oath breaking at distance. The liberation campaign's ultimate weapon.

She could also destroy. The power in her hand — the concentrated, amplified sun-magic — was devastating. She could level the clearing. She could shatter the ward-stones. She could project the blade's energy in a focused beam that would punch through anything — stone, steel, magical barriers, the dimensional boundary that separated the world from the Hunger's domain.

The temptation was immediate and visceral. More power. More reach. More capability. The ability to fight the Dominion on equal terms — to match Valdremor's engineering with raw magical force, to overcome numerical disadvantage with qualitative superiority. The Starshard made her not just a warrior but a weapon of strategic significance, a single person capable of influencing the war at a continental scale.

She released the Starshard. The amplification cut off — the connection severing instantly, the blade returning to its normal output with a suddenness that felt like falling. The golden light dimmed. The warmth returned to its familiar level. The world resumed its normal palette.

Itzil stood in the clearing and breathed. Her hands were shaking — not from exertion but from the aftereffect of channeling power that exceeded her body's normal capacity. The experience was like drinking from a fire hose — the volume overwhelming the vessel, the pressure threatening to crack the container.

Amalura had watched the test through a crystal observation instrument — a device that recorded magical output for analysis. The old scholar's face was grey.

"The relics were scattered for a reason," Amalura said. Her voice carried the weight of a scholar who had studied the pre-Gate civilization's collapse and understood the patterns that preceded catastrophic events. "Too much power in one place attracts attention. The Gate can feel them."

"Feel them how?"

"The relics are pre-Gate artifacts — created by the civilization that built the Gate. They're part of the same magical ecosystem. When the Starshard amplifies the Sun-Blade, the energy output resonates with the Gate's frequency. The Gate responds. The dimensional barrier thins — locally, temporarily, but measurably."

The implication was clear. Using the Starshard amplification strengthened the alliance's military capability while simultaneously weakening the barrier that kept the Hunger at bay. The weapon that could break ash-oaths at distance also accelerated the very catastrophe they were trying to prevent.

"Every time I use this combination," Itzil said, "I'm helping open the Gate."

"Marginally. The effect is small — far smaller than the ash-oath energy that feeds the Gate continuously. But it's not zero. And if used repeatedly, at scale, the cumulative effect could be significant."

A weapon that was also a liability. Power that came with a price measured not in personal cost but in existential risk.

Itzil looked at the Starshard. The relic sat on its pedestal — cold, beautiful, pulsing with the slow rhythm that made it seem almost alive. The power it offered was transformative. The cost was terrifying.

"I'll use it only when necessary," she said. "Sparingly. For operations where the benefit justifies the risk."

"Define necessary."

"When lives depend on it. When the alternative is worse than the cost."

"That's a judgment call. Judgment calls are subjective."

"I know. That's why they're called judgment."

The Starshard was returned to Greystone that evening — transported by Jagren's escort, the relic's tracking signal resuming its transmission to Valdremor's map from the decoy position. Itzil watched it go with the ambivalent expression of a person sending away something that was simultaneously their greatest weapon and their most dangerous possession.

That night, she dreamed.

She stood before the Great Gate — a structure of impossible proportions, carved from obsidian and crystal, rising from the earth like a doorway to another dimension. The Gate was open — not fully, but cracked. A sliver of darkness visible through the gap between the massive doors.

Something pressed through the gap. Not a creature — a presence. Vast. Patient. Hungry. It pushed against the doors the way water pushed against a dam — continuously, relentlessly, the pressure of an ocean against a wall that was designed to hold but was not designed to hold forever.

It whispered. The whisper was not sound — it was feeling. A feeling that bypassed her ears and reached directly into her consciousness, carrying a message that was simultaneously an invitation and a threat.

Her name. It whispered her name.

She woke in a cold sweat. The command tent was dark. The Sun-Blade was at her hip, its warmth a steady comfort against the cold that had settled in her chest.

The Starshard was miles away at Greystone. But in its storage container at the supply depot, the relic was glowing. Faintly, intermittently — the pale starlight pulsing in response to something she couldn't see.

Something that had felt the resonance. Something that had noticed.

The Gate was listening. And the Starshard, whether they used it or not, was part of the conversation.
