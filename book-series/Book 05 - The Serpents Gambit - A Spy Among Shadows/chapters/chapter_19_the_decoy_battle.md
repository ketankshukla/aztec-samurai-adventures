Chapter 19 - THE DECOY BATTLE

The Dominion probe arrived at Greystone Pass three days after the Starshard's return, and Kaelen was ready.

He stood in the decoy base's command post — a fortified bunker that Torvane had constructed from local stone and reinforced with ward-stones that could absorb magical discharge. The bunker overlooked the pass's eastern approach — the most likely avenue for a Dominion advance, given the terrain and the tracking sigil's position.

The Starshard sat in the center of the decoy base, broadcasting its tracking signal to Valdremor's map with the steady, reliable pulse of a beacon that had been placed specifically to attract attention. Around it, the skeleton defense force — two hundred soldiers under Jagren's command — maintained the illusion of a full allied position. Fires burned at regular intervals. Patrol routes followed the patterns of a functioning base. The noise discipline that the real base maintained was deliberately relaxed — voices audible, equipment clanking, the ambient sound of military habitation designed to confirm the tracking sigil's report.

Torvane's traps were everywhere. The engineer had spent a week converting Greystone from a defensive position into a killing ground — pressure-sensitive charges beneath the approach roads, directional explosives in the rock walls, ward-disruption fields that would scramble any magical support the probe carried. The entire pass was a mechanism designed to destroy anything that entered it.

The probe appeared at dawn — a column of approximately five hundred Dominion soldiers, moving through the eastern approach with the cautious efficiency of a force conducting a reconnaissance in force. They carried standard armament — crossbows, short swords, light armor. No sorcerers. No heavy equipment. A probing force, not an assault force.

Kaelen watched them through a crystal scope — Torvane's optical instrument, modified for long-range observation. The soldiers moved in standard Dominion formation: advance scouts, main body, rear guard. Professional. Disciplined. Following the tracking signal like a thread through a maze.

"Five hundred," Kaelen reported through the signal relay. "Standard probe configuration. No magical support. They're here to verify, not to fight."

"Then let them verify," Itzil's voice came through the relay from Thornhaven. "Engage on your terms. Destroy the probe. Harvest any intelligence."

"Understood."

The probe entered the pass. The advance scouts moved through the narrow approach — twenty soldiers, spread across the road in a standard reconnaissance pattern. They found the decoy base's outer perimeter — the deliberately obvious fortifications that suggested a full allied position.

They reported. Kaelen intercepted the communication — Torvane's signal relay capturing the Dominion's coded transmission. The intercept confirmed that the probe was reporting back to a central command before engaging. The communication was directed southeast — toward the Dominion capital.

Toward Valdremor.

The probe advanced. The main body entered the pass — five hundred soldiers moving toward the decoy base with the measured confidence of a force that believed it had the element of surprise.

Kaelen triggered the first trap.

The pressure charges beneath the approach road detonated — a synchronized sequence that turned the stone surface into a storm of shrapnel and concussion. The advance scouts were eliminated instantly. The main body — caught in the narrow pass, confined by the rock walls on either side — was hit by the directional explosives that Torvane had positioned at head height in the cliff faces.

The effect was devastating. The narrow pass amplified the explosions — the confined space converting each charge's blast radius into a wall of force that traveled down the pass like a wave through a tube. Soldiers were thrown off their feet. Equipment was destroyed. The disciplined formation dissolved into chaos.

Jagren's force engaged. The two hundred allied soldiers — positioned above the pass on the cliff edges — struck from elevation with crossbows and thrown weapons, targeting the Dominion soldiers who had survived the initial charges. The combination of traps and ambush converted a five-hundred-soldier probe into a catastrophe in ninety seconds.

The rear guard attempted to withdraw. Kaelen had anticipated this — a second line of charges at the pass's entrance, triggered by the retreat, sealing the exit. The rear guard was caught between the closed entrance and the killing ground — trapped in the same way the alliance had been trapped at Fortress Ashfall, the geometry inverted, the Dominion experiencing its own tactics from the receiving end.

The engagement lasted twelve minutes. When it ended, the Dominion probe was destroyed — five hundred soldiers eliminated by a force less than half their size, using terrain and engineering rather than numerical superiority.

Kaelen moved through the aftermath. The decoy had worked — the probe had followed the tracking sigil to Greystone and found what appeared to be the alliance's primary base. The engagement had provided two critical pieces of intelligence.

First: the intercepted communication. The probe had reported the base's position BEFORE attacking — transmitting coordinates to the Dominion command structure. Valdremor now had confirmation that Greystone was occupied.

Second — and this was the concerning part — the probe's behavior suggested it was a verification mission rather than an assault. Valdremor had sent five hundred soldiers to confirm the tracking sigil's report. He hadn't committed a larger force because he was testing the position before committing resources.

"He's verifying," Kaelen reported to Itzil. "The decoy bought us time — he'll investigate Greystone before looking elsewhere. But when he determines it's a decoy — and he will — he'll expand the search."

"How long?"

"Days. Maybe a week. He'll analyze the engagement, cross-reference the intelligence, and realize the force at Greystone is too small for a primary base. Then he searches the surrounding region."

"The region that includes Thornhaven."

"Yes."

The silence on the relay was the silence of a commander calculating — the mental arithmetic that converted time into options and options into decisions. "Then we make the most of the time we have. The liberation campaign launches now. While Valdremor is focused on Greystone, we deploy oath-breaking teams behind enemy lines."

"Agreed."

The decoy had worked. The probe was destroyed. The alliance had gained days — perhaps a week — of operational freedom. Days in which the liberation campaign could begin, the oath-breaking corps could deploy, and the counter-deception could continue to draw Valdremor's attention away from the real base.

But the clock was ticking. Valdremor would see through the decoy. He would expand the search. And somewhere in the thirty-mile radius that contained Thornhaven, the Architect's attention would find what it was looking for.

Kaelen stood in the destroyed pass and looked at the wreckage of the Dominion probe and felt the particular unease of a man who had won a battle and lost confidence in the war.

"The decoy worked today," he told Itzil through the relay. "It won't work twice. He's learning us faster than we're learning him."

The words hung in the signal. The truth of them was uncomfortable and inescapable.

The serpent's gambit had layers. But the opponent had more.
