# Author's Note

Thank you for reading *Rain of Obsidian*.

This was the hardest book to write. Not technically — technically, it was straightforward. The outline was clear. The beats were mapped. The characters knew what they needed to do.

It was hard because everything falls.

The base is destroyed. The alliance is scattered. Amalura is captured. Korvain is dying. The army is halved. The Starless Crown is at fifty percent and growing. Every safety net has been cut. Every refuge has been burned. The heroes are at their absolute lowest.

And yet.

Korvain's last fight — six minutes of grandmaster-level combat from a seventy-three-year-old body that had nothing left to give and gave it anyway. That scene broke me. The strongest hands Itzil had ever known, trembling on a stretcher. The teacher becoming the patient. The protector needing protection.

Nightshade taking Amalura — the cold, surgical precision of a spymaster who understood that love was the vulnerability and used it without hesitation. Amalura choosing Korvain's life over her own freedom. The scholar who fought from inside a cell with nothing but silence and misdirection.

Rainara feeling the planetary water system sicken. The water-mystic discovering that her fury had a purpose larger than revenge — that she might be the only person who could heal the element that sustained all life.

And the reunion. Itzil and Kaelen across the valley. The grip that was not a hug. The silence that said everything.

The darkest book so far. But darkness is where you discover what you're made of. And these characters — scattered, bleeding, broken — discovered that they were made of something the Architect couldn't calculate and the spymaster couldn't exploit and the emperor couldn't conquer.

They were made of each other.

Book 7 brings Miyako's sacrifice. Book 8 brings the rescue. The breaking continues — but so does the forging.

With gratitude,
Ketan Shukla
