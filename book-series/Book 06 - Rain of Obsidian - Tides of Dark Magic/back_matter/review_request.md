# A Quick Favor

If you made it through *Rain of Obsidian*, you're tough. Thank you.

Would you consider leaving a review on Amazon? Reviews help other readers find the series, and they help me keep writing the stories that put you through this.

Even a single sentence:

> *"This book destroyed me because..."*

Thank you for reading. Thank you for surviving the dark with these characters. And thank you for coming back for more.
