# Aztec Samurai Adventures Book 6: Rain of Obsidian - Tides of Dark Magic

Everything falls. The heroes' hidden base is destroyed, the alliance is scattered, and Amalura is captured. This is the book where the war stops being winnable and starts being survivable.

Valdremor's assault hits at 4:47 AM — obsidian rain falling from the sky like black glass, cutting through defensive wards like paper. Rainara holds the sky with a water-wall for fifteen magnificent, desperate minutes. But Valdremor anticipated her. Three sorcerer teams suppress her simultaneously. The shield fails.

Itzil makes the hardest decision of the war: scatter. Three groups, three directions. Group A north to Thalendor. Group B east as a diversion. Group C south to Coravel. Korvain fights his last fight — six glorious minutes of grandmaster combat, twelve soldiers killed, before his body gives out. Nightshade walks through the chaos and takes Amalura.

The alliance is broken into three pieces. Group B — Kaelen, Rainara, Skyren — survives in the eastern wilderness. Rainara develops water-communication, connecting the scattered groups through the continental water system. She feels Amalura's signature four hundred miles north. She feels the planetary water sickening from the Crown's contamination.

Skyren flies three days solo through hostile territory to reconnect the groups. Korvain tells Itzil his final lesson: "Show up. Every time." Neyla discovers the resonance frequency that breaks ash-oaths cleanly — one session, one break. The method works. Miyako resolves to return to her ash-oathed home city.

Valdremor interrogates Amalura through conversation, not torture. She fights back with silence and misdirection, feeding him false information. Serenthar visits with a prophecy: the future depends on "an armorer no one is watching" — Solkren, who can reforge the incomplete Sun-Blade into the dimensional key it was designed to be.

The scattered alliance reunites at Hidden Valley. Itzil and Kaelen across the valley — the grip, the silence, the reunion. The army is halved. The Crown is at fifty percent. Helisar reports the ash-oaths are weakening — and identifies Neyla as the Dominion's next target.

The heroes are at their lowest. But they hold on. Because holding on is the only thing left. And it is enough.
