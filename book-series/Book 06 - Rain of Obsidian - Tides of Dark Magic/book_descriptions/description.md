# Book Description — Aztec Samurai Adventures Book 6: Rain of Obsidian - Tides of Dark Magic

## Subtitle: Tides of Dark Magic

---

<b>The sky turns black. The rain is glass. And everything the heroes built comes crashing down.</b>

<p>Valdremor's assault hits at dawn — obsidian shards falling from the sky like a curtain of razors, cutting through every defense the alliance has built. The base is destroyed. The alliance is scattered into three groups fleeing in three directions. And Nightshade walks through the chaos to take the one person the heroes can't afford to lose.</p>

<p><b>In this book:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The most devastating battle of the war — obsidian rain, three-front assault, and a water-mystic who holds the sky on her shoulders for fifteen desperate minutes</li>
<li>A grandmaster's last fight — six minutes of perfection from a body that has nothing left to give</li>
<li>A spymaster who captures the alliance's most valuable mind using love as leverage</li>
<li>Three scattered groups surviving alone — wilderness, hostile territory, refugee camps</li>
<li>A healer who discovers how to break the unbreakable — one oath at a time</li>
<li>A prophecy that names the most unlikely hero: an armorer no one is watching</li>
</ul>

<p>Rain of Obsidian is the darkest book in the series — the moment where the war stops being winnable and starts being survivable. Everything falls. But in the falling, the heroes discover what they're made of.</p>

<p>For fans of <i>The Heroes</i> by Joe Abercrombie, <i>The Way of Kings</i>, and <i>The Poppy War</i> — a series where the worst day reveals the strongest people, and the only thing harder than fighting an empire is surviving what the empire takes from you.</p>

<p><i>The long dark presses down. The Crown grows. And two people stand at the edge of the world, hand in hand, and refuse to let go.</i></p>

<p><b>Book 6 of 12 in the <i>Aztec Samurai Adventures</i> series. From Ketan Shukla, published by Metronagon.</b></p>
