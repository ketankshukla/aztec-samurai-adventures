# Chapter 1 Summary — THE OBSIDIAN SKY

**POV:** Itzil

Ward-detection network screams at 4:47 AM. Massive magical signatures approaching from three directions. Obsidian rain falls — razor-sharp volcanic glass infused with dark magic that cuts through defensive wards. Rainara creates a water-wall dome that deflects 70% of the rain.

Through the curtain of black shards, the Dominion army emerges — not a raid but a full assault force. Thousands of soldiers, war-beasts, sorcerers. Valdremor brought everything.

**Key Events:** Pre-dawn assault, obsidian rain weapon introduced, wards destroyed, Rainara becomes the primary shield, full Dominion assault force revealed.

**Cliffhanger:** The obsidian rain intensifies. Valdremor brought everything. The breaking begins.
