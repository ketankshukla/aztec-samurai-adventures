# Chapter 2 Summary — VALDREMOR'S PRECISION

**POV:** Valdremor (Villain)

Valdremor commands from a mobile command post. His assault is surgical: obsidian rain to neutralize wards, targeted strikes on communication towers, collapse evacuation tunnels. Two of three tunnels sealed. He assigns three sorcerer teams to suppress Rainara.

Crystal eye tracks every magical signature — Sun-Blade, Rainara, Amalura. Nightshade's team moves into position for the secondary objective.

**Key Events:** Communication towers destroyed, two tunnels collapsed, three sorcerer teams assigned to Rainara, Nightshade in position for Amalura capture.

**Cliffhanger:** "The old woman is the priority. Everything else is distraction."
