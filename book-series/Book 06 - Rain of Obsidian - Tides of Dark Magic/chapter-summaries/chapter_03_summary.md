# Chapter 3 Summary — THE DEFENSE

**POV:** Rainara

Rainara fights three sorcerer teams simultaneously — evaporation, freezing, scatter. Each attacks a different property of water. She holds the dome for fifteen minutes. Kaelen fights beside her, developing wordless combat coordination.

One team breaks through — obsidian hits the medical area. Rainara screams with rage and obliterates the team with a water cannon that carves a trench in the earth. But she's burning through reserves. Dark magic corrupts the water she's using.

**Key Events:** Three-front magical assault on Rainara, 15-minute shield hold, Kaelen-Rainara wordless coordination, sorcerer team destroyed, reserves depleting.

**Cliffhanger:** "How long?" "Minutes. Five. Maybe less." The breaking is coming.
