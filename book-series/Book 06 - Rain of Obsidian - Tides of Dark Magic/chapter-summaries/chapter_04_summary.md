# Chapter 4 Summary — THE SCATTERING

**POV:** Itzil

Itzil orders Dispersal Protocol Three — scatter into three groups. Group A (Itzil, Jagren, Torvane) north to Thalendor. Group B (Kaelen, Rainara, Skyren) east as diversion. Group C (Zariel, Neyla, Miyako) south to Coravel with non-combatants.

Itzil and Kaelen's goodbye: "I'll find you." "I'll find YOU. That's my job." Rainara drops the water-wall and creates a false river on the eastern flank — the diversion that draws 2,000 Dominion soldiers east while the other groups escape.

**Key Events:** Scatter order given, three groups assigned, Itzil-Kaelen separation, Rainara's false river diversion, base lost.

**Cliffhanger:** The base burns. The alliance is broken into three pieces. The scattering is complete.
