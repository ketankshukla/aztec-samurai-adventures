# Chapter 5 Summary — KORVAIN'S LAST FIGHT

**POV:** Korvain

First extended Korvain POV. He and Amalura work in the intelligence vault — she memorizes, he burns records. Dominion soldiers breach the corridor. Korvain draws his staff-blade and fights.

Six glorious minutes of grandmaster-level combat. Amber glow. Perfect economy of motion. Twelve soldiers killed. Then his body gives out — joints grinding, heart pounding, lungs failing. He collapses. Amalura catches him: "You fool. You magnificent fool."

**Key Events:** Intelligence vault defense, Korvain's six-minute last stand, twelve soldiers killed, grandmaster collapse, Amalura catches him.

**Cliffhanger:** Korvain collapses. The exertion has pushed his failing body past the limit. What comes next is Nightshade.
