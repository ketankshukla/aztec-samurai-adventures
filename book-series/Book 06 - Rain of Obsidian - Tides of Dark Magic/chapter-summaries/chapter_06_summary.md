# Chapter 6 Summary — NIGHTSHADE TAKES AMALURA

**POV:** Amalura

Nightshade appears in the vault doorway — walked through battle via blood-portals. "Come quietly, keeper. Your knowledge is the most valuable thing in this base." Korvain tries to rise. Nightshade uses blood-magic to paralyze him — holds the blood in his veins still.

Amalura's choice: fight and Korvain dies, or surrender and he lives. She chooses: "Remember what I told you. All of it." She walks to Nightshade. Through the blood-portal. Gone.

**Key Events:** Nightshade enters via blood-portal, Korvain paralyzed by blood-magic, Amalura surrenders to save Korvain, captured through portal.

**Cliffhanger:** The paralysis releases. Korvain falls to his knees. He screams Amalura's name. She's gone.
