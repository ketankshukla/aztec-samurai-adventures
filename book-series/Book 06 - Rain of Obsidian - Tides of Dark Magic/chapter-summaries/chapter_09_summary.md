# Chapter 9 Summary — GROUP C FLEES

**POV:** Neyla

Group C escorts 300 non-combatants and 50 wounded south to Coravel. Neyla heals as they walk — triage healing, enough not excellence. Zariel organizes the march with gentle authority. Miyako scouts ahead, neutralizing two Dominion patrols silently.

A child asks: "Are we going to die?" Neyla kneels: "Not today. I promise." They reach Coravel's territory by nightfall of the second day. Safe — for now.

**Key Events:** Non-combatant evacuation south, Neyla's continuous healing, Zariel's crisis leadership, Miyako neutralizes two patrols, promise to the child, Coravel sanctuary reached.

**Cliffhanger:** Neyla looks north: "Where are you, Itzil?" The groups are cut off from each other.
