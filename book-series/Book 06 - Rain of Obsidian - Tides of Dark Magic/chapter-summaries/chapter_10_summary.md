# Chapter 10 Summary — KORVAIN RECOVERED

**POV:** Itzil

Korvain arrives at Thalendor on a stretcher. Alive but broken — joints inflamed, heart damaged, hands trembling. He tells Itzil what happened: Amalura surrendered to save his life. "She chose me over the mission."

Korvain grips Itzil's hand — the strongest hands she's ever known, now trembling. "I've taught you everything I know. Everything that remains... you'll have to learn by doing." The student is becoming the master.

**Key Events:** Korvain's condition assessed, Amalura capture reported, mentor-student dynamic shifts, Korvain's final lesson begins.

**Cliffhanger:** "You're ready. You have been for a while. You just needed to stop asking permission to lead."
