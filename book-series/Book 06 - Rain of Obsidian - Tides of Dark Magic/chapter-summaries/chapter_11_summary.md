# Chapter 11 Summary — SCATTERED AND ALONE

**POV:** Kaelen

Group B survives in the eastern wilderness — shelter, water, fire. Rainara recovers slowly. She can feel Amalura's moisture signature 400 miles north — stationary, being transported to a detention tower.

Rainara wants to rescue immediately. Kaelen says no — "If we go in half-dead and exhausted, we join her in a cell." Fierce argument: fury vs. logic. She sits down: "You're right. I hate that you're right."

Rainara sends water-communication message. Response comes: "Skyren — fly north. Signal Itzil."

**Key Events:** Wilderness survival, Rainara tracks Amalura, fury vs. logic argument, water-communication established, Skyren dispatched north.

**Cliffhanger:** Skyren launches toward Thalendor. Three days of flying through hostile territory.
