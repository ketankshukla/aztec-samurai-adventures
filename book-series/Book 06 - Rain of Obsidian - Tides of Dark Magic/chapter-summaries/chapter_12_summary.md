# Chapter 12 Summary — AMALURA IN CHAINS

**POV:** Amalura

Amalura in a comfortable detention cell — bed, books, food. All of it weaponized. Pillow has a listening spell. Books are propaganda. Food is drugged (cumulative, not immediate). She eats sparingly, drinks condensation from the windowsill.

Valdremor visits. Polite, methodical questions about ancient history and relics. Amalura refuses to answer. He leaves: "We'll try again tomorrow." She plans her counter-strategy — false architecture of silence designed to misdirect his model.

**Key Events:** Detention tower described, cell traps identified, Valdremor's first interrogation, Amalura's counter-strategy planned.

**Cliffhanger:** "Clever. But I'm cleverer." The prisoner is the most dangerous person in the building.
