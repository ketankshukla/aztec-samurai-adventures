# Chapter 13 Summary — VALDREMOR'S METHOD

**POV:** Valdremor (Villain)

Valdremor interrogates Amalura through daily conversations — not torture but pattern-mapping. He builds a psychological model from her avoidance patterns and micro-expressions. By day 14, he has a partial copy of her knowledge structure.

He discovers Amalura is fighting back — planting false blanks, feeding misdirections through structured silence. "Remarkable woman. In another world, she'd have made an excellent Architect." He files the intelligence, flags probable errors.

**Key Events:** Pattern-mapping interrogation technique, psychological model built, partial knowledge copy, Amalura's counter-sabotage detected, intelligence filed with caveats.

**Cliffhanger:** He knows the Sun-Blade's limitations, relic locations, and that ash-oath reversal is possible. This drives his strategy for the rest of the war.
