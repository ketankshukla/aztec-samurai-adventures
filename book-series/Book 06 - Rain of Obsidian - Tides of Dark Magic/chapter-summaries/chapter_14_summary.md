# Chapter 14 Summary — RAINARA'S TRACKING

**POV:** Rainara

Rainara's water-sense expands to miles. She tracks Amalura's signature — stationary, 400 miles north. She also discovers the planetary water system is sick — the Starless Crown's dark magic contaminating rivers, rain, groundwater globally.

She connects briefly to the entire planetary water system — every ocean, river, raindrop. Overwhelming. She realizes she may be "the antibody" — the only person who can heal the contamination. Her fury transforms from personal revenge into planetary purpose.

**Key Events:** Expanded water-sense, Amalura tracked, global water contamination discovered, planetary connection moment, "antibody" realization.

**Cliffhanger:** "I think I'm the antibody." The war has given her rage. The water is giving her something bigger — a reason beyond revenge.
