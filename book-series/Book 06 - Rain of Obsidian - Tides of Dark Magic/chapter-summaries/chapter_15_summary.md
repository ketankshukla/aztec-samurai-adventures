# Chapter 15 Summary — SKYREN'S FLIGHT

**POV:** Skyren

Three-day solo flight north through hostile territory. Skyren evades hawk-killer batteries and trained Dominion war-raptors. Cielovar outflies everything. The Starless Crown visible at ~45% from altitude — accelerating.

She crash-lands at Thalendor camp — exhausted, wind-burned, dehydrated. Delivers the message: Group B alive, Rainara can track Amalura, Kaelen has a plan. Rendezvous at Hidden Valley, seven days.

**Key Events:** Three-day solo flight, hawk-killer evasion, war-raptor chase, Crown at 45%, crash landing, message delivered.

**Cliffhanger:** Itzil: "Tell them to hold position. We're coming to them." The scattered pieces are reconnecting.
