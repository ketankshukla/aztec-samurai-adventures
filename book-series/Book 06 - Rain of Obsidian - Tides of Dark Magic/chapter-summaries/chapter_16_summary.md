# Chapter 16 Summary — KORVAIN'S DECLINE

**POV:** Itzil

Korvain's condition worsens — can't walk without support, hands shake, breathing labored. "I'm dying, Itzil. Not today, maybe not this month. But soon." His final lesson: leadership is presence. "Show up. Every time. Even when you don't know the answer."

Itzil breaks down — privately, with him. First and only time she cries before Book 8. He holds her: "You're ready. You just needed to stop asking permission to lead." She straightens. Wipes her eyes. The student becomes the master.

**Key Events:** Korvain's decline accelerating, final lesson on presence, Itzil's private breakdown, mentor-student transition complete.

**Cliffhanger:** She walks to the command position. The work of rebuilding begins. The student is the master now.
