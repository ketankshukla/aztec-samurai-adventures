# Chapter 17 Summary — REGROUPING

**POV:** Itzil

Itzil coordinates the alliance's convergence on Hidden Valley. Three groups move through hostile territory — Group A south from Thalendor, Group B west from eastern wilderness, Group C north from Coravel. Rainara maintains water-communication network connecting all groups.

Logistics are brutal. Torvane manages Group A's march rate. Zariel's diplomatic network provides safe passage for Group C. The scattered alliance is harder to find than a consolidated one — the tragedy is now an advantage.

**Key Events:** Three-group convergence coordinated, water-communication network maintained, seven-day march timeline, Dominion hunting scattered groups.

**Cliffhanger:** Kaelen's message: "On our way. We have a plan for Amalura." The reunion is seven days away.
