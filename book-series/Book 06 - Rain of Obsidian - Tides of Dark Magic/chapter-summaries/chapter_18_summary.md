# Chapter 18 Summary — NEYLA'S BREAKTHROUGH

**POV:** Neyla

Neyla discovers the resonance frequency technique — matching the ash-oath's harmonic with calibrated healing magic shatters the binding cleanly in one session. She frees a woman named Sera. The sigil cracks and dissolves into ash. "My name is Sera."

The scaling implications are staggering — if taught to other healers, the technique could match Helisar's rate of enslavement. Energy cost is significant but manageable. She sends word to Itzil: "I can break ash-oaths. The method works. This changes everything."

**Key Events:** Resonance frequency technique proven, clean single-session oath breaking, Sera freed, scaling potential identified, breakthrough reported.

**Cliffhanger:** The method works. Methods that work can be scaled. And scaled methods can change the world.
