# Chapter 19 Summary — MIYAKO'S RESOLVE

**POV:** Miyako

Miyako trains at midnight — pushing her 63-year-old body harder than maintenance requires. Her home city Ashenmoor is under Helisar's control. Everyone she left behind is ash-oathed. The shame of running decades ago has never left.

"I ran once. People I loved paid the price. I will not run again." Her resolve is absolute. Zariel offers to help plan: "If you're going to do something impossible, at least do it with good intelligence." This sets up her sacrifice in Book 7.

**Key Events:** Miyako's increased training, Ashenmoor confirmation, shame of running confronted, resolve to return, Zariel offers planning support.

**Cliffhanger:** The shadow master is stepping into the light. Not because the light is safe — because the light is necessary.
