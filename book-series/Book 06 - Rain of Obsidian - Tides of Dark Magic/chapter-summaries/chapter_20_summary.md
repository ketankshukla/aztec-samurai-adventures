# Chapter 20 Summary — THE WATER MESSAGE

**POV:** Kaelen

Kaelen and Rainara march west toward Hidden Valley. Through the water network, they piece together the full picture — Amalura in detention tower on a river, Valdremor extracting knowledge, Crown accelerating.

Kaelen formulates the rescue plan framework — Rainara's water vector through the unwarded river, full team required. Rainara senses Amalura fighting back, feeding Valdremor false information. "She's still fighting. From inside a cell, she's still fighting."

**Key Events:** Rescue plan framework developed, water vector identified (unwarded river), Amalura's active sabotage detected, Rainara's planetary purpose discussed.

**Cliffhanger:** "Win the war. Heal the water. That's the after." Two people, one plan, one purpose.
