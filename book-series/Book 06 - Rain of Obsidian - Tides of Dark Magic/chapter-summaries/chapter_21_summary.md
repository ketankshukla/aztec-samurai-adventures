# Chapter 21 Summary — THE REUNION

**POV:** Itzil

The scattered alliance reunites at Hidden Valley. Group A arrives first, then Group C, then Group B is already there. Itzil sees Kaelen across the valley — walks toward him, pace accelerating. She grabs him. Not a hug — a grip. He holds back.

The team counts heads. Army halved. Korvain on a stretcher. Amalura gone. But alive and together. Itzil addresses the reformed alliance: "We lost our home. We are not done losing. But we are HERE. And as long as we're here, we fight."

That night around a fire — Kaelen sits beside Itzil. She leans against him. He lets her. Contact maintained.

**Key Events:** Three groups converge, Itzil-Kaelen reunion grip, army assessment, Itzil's speech, fire scene with full team, physical contact.

**Cliffhanger:** The heroes are at their lowest. But not broken. Not yet. Tonight they sit together. And that is enough.
