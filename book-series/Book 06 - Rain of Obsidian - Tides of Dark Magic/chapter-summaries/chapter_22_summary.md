# Chapter 22 Summary — HELISAR'S EXPANSION

**POV:** Helisar (Villain)

Helisar operates 12 ash-oath facilities processing 200 conversions/day. He sees it as liberation from chaos. Reports to Volzentar: the Crown needs more power. But the oaths are weakening — increased resistance during conversion, flickers of awareness in the newly-oathed.

"Someone is pulling at the threads of my work." He sends a report to Nightshade: "There's a healer in their ranks who can weaken ash-oaths. Find her." Neyla just became the Dominion's #1 target.

**Key Events:** Helisar's 12-city operation described, 200/day conversion rate, oath weakening detected, Neyla identified as priority target.

**Cliffhanger:** The Dominion now knows about Neyla's ability. The most dangerous person in the alliance isn't the one with the blade — it's the one with the gentle hands.
