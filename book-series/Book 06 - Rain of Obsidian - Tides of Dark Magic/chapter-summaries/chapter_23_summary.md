# Chapter 23 Summary — SERENTHAR AND AMALURA

**POV:** Serenthar (Villain)

Serenthar visits Amalura in the detention tower. Two ancient keepers of knowledge face to face. "Between us, we hold the shape of every possible future." Amalura: "Which one happens?"

Serenthar gives a direct answer for the first time: "The one that depends on an armorer no one is watching." Solkren — the quiet armorer who can reforge the Sun-Blade into the dimensional key it was designed to be. The reforging knowledge is hidden in Amalura's Sealed Archive.

Amalura whispers: "Korvain, I hope you're listening." The key to everything depends on getting out of this tower alive.

**Key Events:** Serenthar-Amalura meeting, prophecy delivered ("armorer no one is watching"), Sun-Blade revealed as dimensional key, reforging knowledge in Sealed Archive.

**Cliffhanger:** Everything depends on hands that understand metal. Everything depends on getting out of this tower alive.
