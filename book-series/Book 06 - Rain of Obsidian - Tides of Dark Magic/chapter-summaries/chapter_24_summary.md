# Chapter 24 Summary — THE LONG DARK

**POV:** Itzil

The alliance settles into Hidden Valley. Strategic review: Amalura captured, Korvain dying, army halved, two relics in hand, Crown at ~50%. For the first time, the council discusses the possibility of defeat.

Itzil decides: rescue Amalura AND continue the war simultaneously. Split focus, maximum risk. "Anything less means slow defeat." Kaelen has a plan — complex, dangerous, probability uncertain.

Itzil steps outside. Whispers: "We're coming, Amalura. Hold on." Kaelen's voice behind her: "She's the toughest person I've ever met. Except maybe you." She reaches back. Finds his hand. He takes it. They stand in the dark, hand in hand, looking at the Crown.

**Key Events:** Strategic picture assessed, defeat discussed, dual-track strategy decided, rescue and war simultaneously, Itzil-Kaelen hand in hand.

**Cliffhanger:** The heroes are at their lowest. But they hold on. Because holding on is the only thing left. And it is enough.
