Chapter 1 - THE OBSIDIAN SKY

The ward-detection network screamed at 4:47 AM, and Itzil was on her feet before the sound registered as language.

The scream was not metaphorical. Torvane's crystal sensors produced a shrieking harmonic when they detected magical signatures above a certain threshold — the threshold that separated routine magical activity from catastrophic threat. The harmonic was designed to be impossible to sleep through, to bypass the brain's filtering mechanisms and reach the primitive, reptilian core that responded to danger before consciousness could intervene.

Itzil was out of her cot and reaching for the Sun-Blade before her eyes were fully open. The blade's warmth met her hand — the golden light igniting at her touch, responding to the urgency that her body communicated through the grip.

"Torvane!" She was running before the name left her mouth — out of the command tent, into the pre-dawn darkness of Thornhaven, the camp erupting around her as ten thousand soldiers responded to the alarm with the trained urgency of people who had rehearsed this moment and prayed it would never come.

Torvane was at the detection station. The engineer's face was lit by the red glow of crystal monitors that were registering signatures so intense that the display had shifted from its normal blue to emergency crimson.

"Three approach vectors," Torvane said. His voice was controlled — the professional delivery of a man whose instruments were telling him something terrible and who was converting the terror into data because data could be acted upon. "North, west, and south. Massive magical signatures — blood-wards, mirror-portals, and something I've never seen before. The readings are off my scale."

"How many?"

"Thousands. The magical signatures suggest a combined force of at least eight thousand, supported by sorcerer teams and..." He paused. His eyes widened — the micro-expression of an engineer encountering a reading that exceeded his instrument's design parameters. "...and an aerial bombardment array. They're launching something from altitude. Incoming in approximately ninety seconds."

Ninety seconds. Itzil's mind converted the number into actions — the compressed decision-making that command had burned into her neural pathways, the ability to process catastrophic information and produce operational responses in the space between heartbeats.

"Emergency protocol! All units to defensive positions! Non-combatants to evacuation tunnels! NOW!"

The camp erupted. Soldiers who had been sleeping seconds ago were now moving — grabbing weapons, pulling armor over sleep clothes, running to the positions that Kaelen had designated during the base's establishment. The evacuation tunnels — three concealed passages that led from Thornhaven's valley floor to exit points in the surrounding mountains — were opening, the non-combatant population streaming toward them with the controlled urgency of people following a plan they had practiced.

Sixty seconds.

Itzil ran to the valley's center — the highest point in the camp, where the command infrastructure was positioned. The Sun-Blade blazed in her hand, the golden light cutting through the pre-dawn darkness like a beacon. She could feel the approaching threat — not through the detection network but through the blade itself, the ancient weapon resonating with the magical energy that was converging on their position from three directions.

Forty seconds.

Rainara appeared beside her. The water-knot mystic had been awake before the alarm — her water-sense had detected the approaching disturbance minutes before Torvane's instruments, the contamination of atmospheric moisture by dark magic registering as a wrongness that had pulled her from sleep like a hand pulling a swimmer from deep water.

"Something's falling," Rainara said. Her voice was tight — the controlled delivery of a person whose senses were telling her something that exceeded her vocabulary. "From above. I can feel it in the water — the moisture in the air is being displaced by something dense, something sharp, something—"

The sky turned black.

Not the gradual darkening of clouds moving across stars — an instantaneous transformation, as though a curtain had been drawn across the heavens. The pre-dawn greyness that had been lightening toward sunrise was replaced by absolute darkness — the darkness of a sky that had been filled with something that absorbed light.

Then the rain began.

Not water. Glass. Obsidian — razor-sharp volcanic glass infused with dark magic, falling from the sky in a curtain of black shards that caught the Sun-Blade's golden light and threw it back in fragments of lethal beauty. Each shard was approximately the size of a finger — thin, pointed, aerodynamically shaped to fall fast and cut deep. They struck the ground with the sound of a thousand windchimes played by a hurricane.

The first shards hit the camp's defensive wards — the protective barriers that Torvane had erected around the perimeter. The wards held for approximately three seconds. Then the obsidian cut through them — the dark magic infused in the glass designed specifically to neutralize conventional ward-structures, the shards slicing through the magical barriers like razors through paper.

Soldiers screamed. The obsidian rain struck exposed positions with indiscriminate lethality — shards embedding in earth, in wood, in flesh. The camp's canvas structures shredded. Equipment was destroyed. The first casualties fell in the opening seconds — soldiers who had been running to positions and were caught in the open by a weapon they had never seen and couldn't defend against.

Rainara reacted. The water-knot mystic raised both hands and pulled — drawing moisture from the air, from the ground, from the trees, from every source within a hundred feet. The moisture converged above the camp in a sheet — a water-wall that spread across the sky like an umbrella, intercepting the obsidian rain before it reached the ground.

The shards hit the water-wall and slowed — their velocity reduced by the liquid medium, the dark magic's cutting edge blunted by the water's resistance. Shards that would have killed at terminal velocity instead fell through the water-wall at a fraction of their speed, landing on the ground with enough force to embed but not enough to penetrate armor.

Rainara became the shield. The water-wall expanded — spreading outward from the camp's center, covering more and more of the base as she drew more and more moisture to maintain it. Her face was a mask of concentration — every ounce of her power directed toward the single task of keeping the sky from killing everyone beneath it.

"I can hold it," she said through clenched teeth. "But not forever. The rain is corrupted — dark magic is tainting the water I'm using. Every minute, I have less clean water to work with."

Itzil assessed. The obsidian rain was the first phase — the softening strike, designed to neutralize defenses and create chaos before the main assault. Through the curtain of black shards, she could see shapes moving in the forest beyond the valley — the dark mass of an approaching army, emerging from three directions with the coordinated precision of a force that had been positioned in advance and was executing a plan that had been designed by someone who left nothing to chance.

Valdremor. The Architect had found them. The silence that Kaelen had identified — the communications blackout, the intelligence vacuum — had been the preparation phase. And now the preparation was complete and the strike was here and the alliance's hidden base at Thornhaven was under the most devastating assault the war had produced.

Thousands of soldiers. Sorcerer teams. The obsidian rain that was cutting through defenses like nothing the alliance had encountered. And behind it all, the calm, precise, emotionless mind of the Architect — engineering the destruction of the only force that could prevent the Great Gate from opening.

"Rainara — hold the shield. Everyone who can fight — to the perimeter. This is not a raid. This is everything they have." Itzil ignited the Sun-Blade to its fullest blaze — the golden light cutting through the obsidian darkness, a beacon that every allied soldier could see and orient toward. "We hold as long as we can. Then we move."

The obsidian rain intensified. Through the curtain of black glass, the Dominion army emerged — not a raiding party but a full assault force. Thousands of soldiers. War-beasts. Sorcerers whose combined magical output registered on Torvane's instruments as a wall of energy approaching from three directions.

Valdremor had brought everything.

And the alliance — scattered from sleep, shielded by a single water-mystic, led by a young woman with a golden blade — prepared to fight for survival in the hardest battle of the war.

The obsidian sky pressed down. The rain fell. The darkness descended.

And the breaking began.
