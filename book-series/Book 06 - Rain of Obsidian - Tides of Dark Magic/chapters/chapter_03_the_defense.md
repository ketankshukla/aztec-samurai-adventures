Chapter 3 - THE DEFENSE

Rainara held the sky on her shoulders and the sky was winning.

The water-wall spread above Thornhaven like a liquid dome — a hundred feet across, six inches thick, maintained by every ounce of power that Rainara possessed. The obsidian rain struck it from above — black shards hammering the water's surface with the relentless percussion of a storm that had been engineered rather than born. Each shard that hit the wall lost velocity, tumbled through the liquid medium, and fell to the ground below with diminished force — still dangerous, still sharp, but no longer instantly lethal.

She was magnificent. Even in the chaos of the assault, even with the camp disintegrating around her and the screams of wounded soldiers and the deep, grinding rumble of Dominion sorcery pressing in from three directions — even in all of that, Rainara was magnificent. The water-wall was the most powerful individual defensive application the alliance had ever seen. A single person, channeling the fundamental force of liquid, holding back a weapon that had been designed to destroy an army's defenses in minutes.

But Valdremor had anticipated her.

The first sorcerer team hit from the north — evaporation magic, a targeted wave of thermal energy that turned a section of the water-wall into steam. The gap opened instantly — a hole in the liquid dome through which obsidian shards fell at full velocity, striking the camp below with the lethal efficiency that Valdremor had designed. Soldiers scrambled for cover. Two didn't make it.

Rainara closed the gap. She pulled moisture from deeper sources — from the ground, from the trees at the valley's edge, from the underground river that flowed beneath Thornhaven's floor. The water-wall reformed. The gap sealed.

The second team hit from the west — freezing magic, a blast of cold that crystallized a section of the wall into ice. The ice was rigid — it didn't flow, didn't reshape, didn't respond to Rainara's commands the way liquid water did. The obsidian shards struck the frozen section and shattered it, the ice breaking into fragments that fell with the obsidian, a cascade of frozen water and volcanic glass that was almost beautiful in its lethality.

Rainara melted the ice. Converted it back to liquid. Reshaped the wall. The frozen section returned to fluid.

The third team hit from the south — scatter magic, a wind-force that disrupted the wall's cohesion, spreading the water into droplets that were too dispersed to provide protection. The section thinned — from six inches to one, to nothing, the liquid scattered into mist that caught the pre-dawn light and sparkled with the dark beauty of a weapon being dismantled.

Three attacks. Three fronts. Three simultaneous assaults on different properties of water — thermal, structural, cohesive. Each one required a different response. Each response diverted attention from the other two.

Rainara fought all three. Her arms were raised — both hands extended toward the sky, fingers spread, the gesture of a person channeling power through their body the way a wire channeled electricity. The turquoise light of her water-magic blazed around her — visible, intense, the magical equivalent of a bonfire that every sorcerer on the battlefield could see and target.

Kaelen fought beside her. The scout had positioned himself at Rainara's six o'clock — the blind spot that existed behind a person who was focused entirely on what was above them. His shadow-step was active, the perceptual erasure making him invisible to the Dominion soldiers who were pressing through the camp's breached perimeter. He moved with the fluid, precise violence of a man who had spent his life in shadows and was now fighting in the open because the person beside him needed protection more than the shadows needed occupants.

They developed a wordless language. Kaelen pointed — a subtle gesture, a direction indicated by the angle of his hand. Rainara responded — a water-blast, a ice-wall, a fog-cloud directed at the indicated threat. The coordination was instantaneous, unconscious, the kind of partnership that existed when two people trusted each other's judgment completely and acted on that trust without the delay of verbal communication.

A Dominion soldier broke through the defensive line — a heavy infantry trooper who had found a gap and was charging toward Rainara's position with the single-minded determination of a soldier executing a target-priority order. Kaelen intercepted. Shadow-step closed the distance in one second. His blade found the gap between the soldier's helmet and shoulder guard. Clean. Fast. The soldier fell.

Another. And another. The Dominion's assault was pressing inward — the eight-thousand-soldier force collapsing the camp's perimeter with the coordinated pressure of a mechanism designed to squeeze and crush. Kaelen fought at the compression point — the place where the pressure was highest, where the Dominion soldiers were closest to Rainara, where every second of delay was a second that the water-wall remained intact.

The sorcerer teams rotated. Every thirty seconds — Valdremor's prescribed interval — the attacks shifted. Evaporation became freezing. Freezing became scatter. Scatter became evaporation. The rotation prevented Rainara from adapting — every time she adjusted to one attack pattern, the pattern changed.

She was burning through her reserves. The water-wall consumed enormous amounts of magical energy — maintaining a hundred-foot dome of liquid against gravity while simultaneously fighting three different forms of magical assault was an output that exceeded anything she had attempted before. Her reserves — the internal pool of magical energy that powered her water-knot abilities — were draining at a rate that would reach zero within minutes.

"I can hold it," she said through clenched teeth. The words were not a report — they were a commitment. A statement of will that was fighting against the mathematics of depletion.

"The rain is corrupted," she continued. "Dark magic is tainting every drop. I can't use the fallen water — it's poisoned. I'm running out of clean sources."

The corruption was Valdremor's refinement — the dark-magic infusion in the obsidian shards contaminating every drop of water they contacted, converting the alliance's most abundant resource into a toxic medium that Rainara's magic couldn't safely manipulate. The Architect had designed the weapon not just to kill through impact but to deny the water-mystic her primary element.

One of the sorcerer teams broke through. A coordinated triple-strike — evaporation, freezing, and scatter hitting the same section simultaneously — overwhelmed Rainara's capacity to respond. The water-wall collapsed in a ten-foot section directly above the camp's medical area.

Obsidian shards fell through the gap — full velocity, full lethality. They struck the medical tents with the sound of glass breaking on canvas. Wounded soldiers who had been receiving treatment were hit. Healers were hit. The particular horror of a weapon that didn't discriminate between combatants and casualties.

Rainara screamed. Not from pain — from rage. The sound was primal, visceral, the sound of a person who was watching people die under a sky she had promised to hold. The rage was the fuel that her reserves were running out of — the emotional energy that converted depletion into determination, that pushed past empty and found more.

Her power surged. The water-wall didn't just reform — it EXPANDED. Rainara drew water from sources she hadn't touched — from the underground river, from the mountain's deep geology, from aquifers that had been sealed for centuries. The wall thickened. The dome solidified. And from the reformed section, a focused blast of water — compressed, accelerated, shaped into a projectile with the density of stone and the speed of a crossbow bolt — launched toward the sorcerer team that had broken through.

The water cannon struck. The sorcerer team's position — three practitioners, their magical output focused on the breakthrough — was obliterated. The compressed water carved a trench in the earth — six feet deep, thirty feet long — and the sorcerers within it ceased to exist as functional combatants.

But the surge cost her. The output required to launch the water cannon while maintaining the dome was beyond sustainable — the mathematical equivalent of sprinting while holding a weight overhead. Her reserves plunged. Her vision greyed at the edges. Her arms trembled — not from cold but from the physiological cost of channeling more energy than her body was designed to contain.

"Rainara." Kaelen's voice, beside her. Close. Steady. The voice of a person who was watching her burn and was calculating the time remaining before the flame consumed the fuel. "How long?"

"Minutes. Five. Maybe less."

"Then we need to leave in four."

She looked at him. The fury in her eyes — the concentrated, weeks-long fury that had defined her since Relicara's cell — was still there. But beneath it, something else. Exhaustion. The particular exhaustion of a person who had given everything and was discovering that everything was not enough.

"I can't hold it and move," she said. "The wall drops when I drop."

"Then we move fast."

The obsidian rain continued. The sorcerer teams regrouped — the destroyed team replaced by reserves, the rotation resuming, the pressure constant. Rainara held the wall. Kaelen held the ground around her. And somewhere above them, the obsidian sky pressed down with the patient, relentless weight of a weapon that had all the time in the world.

Four minutes.

The breaking was coming. And the water-mystic who held the sky on her shoulders was running out of strength to hold it.
