Chapter 4 - THE SCATTERING

The base was falling and Itzil made the decision that would define the rest of the war.

She stood at the command position — the elevated ground at Thornhaven's center where the Sun-Blade's golden light served as both beacon and defiance. The camp was disintegrating around her. Dominion forces had breached the outer perimeter on all three vectors. The obsidian rain was thinning — Valdremor shifting his bombardment to support the ground assault — but the damage was done. The ward-stones were shattered. The defensive positions were overrun. The evacuation tunnels — two of three collapsed by precision strikes — funneled the non-combatant population toward the single remaining exit.

Rainara's water-wall was failing. The mystic was burning through her last reserves — the dome flickering, gaps appearing and closing with decreasing speed, the shield that had been the alliance's salvation degrading toward collapse. Five minutes. Maybe less.

Torvane's instruments showed the tactical picture with merciless clarity. Eight thousand Dominion soldiers. Three sorcerer teams still operational. The alliance's effective combat strength — the soldiers who were armed, positioned, and capable of fighting — was approximately four thousand. Half the Dominion's force. Caught in an encirclement with one exit. Outgunned, outmaneuvered, and out-engineered by an opponent who had designed this assault with surgical precision.

The math was simple. If they stayed, they died. All of them. The Dominion's numerical superiority, combined with Valdremor's tactical precision, would collapse the defense within the hour. The alliance would cease to exist as a military force.

If they ran — together, in one direction — the Dominion's pursuit force would follow and the running battle would bleed them dry before they reached safety. A concentrated retreat was a concentrated target.

Which left the third option. The option that Itzil had discussed with Kaelen in abstract terms during the base's establishment and had hoped, with the desperate hope of a commander who understood probability, would never be necessary.

Scatter.

"All unit commanders — emergency channel." Her voice was steady. The command mask held — the controlled expression that processed catastrophic information without displaying the catastrophe. "The base is compromised. We are executing Dispersal Protocol Three. I say again — Dispersal Protocol Three."

The protocol was known to every officer. It had been briefed, rehearsed, drilled. Three groups. Three directions. Maximum dispersal to minimize the probability of total destruction.

"Group A — main army. With me, Jagren, and Torvane. We evacuate north through the remaining tunnel and march to Thalendor. Brennan's mountain forces will provide cover at the border."

"Group B — Kaelen, Rainara, Skyren. You are the diversion. Eastern flank. Make noise. Draw pursuit. Buy the other groups time to clear. Then break east and survive."

"Group C — Zariel, Neyla, Miyako. Non-combatants and wounded. South to Coravel's territory. Zariel's diplomatic connections will provide safe passage."

The assignments were tactical — each group's composition reflecting its mission. Group A needed military strength for the fighting retreat. Group B needed speed and power for the diversion. Group C needed healing and stealth for the vulnerable population.

"Korvain and Amalura will remain to destroy sensitive intelligence. Nothing falls into Dominion hands. They will evacuate through the northern tunnel with the last elements of Group A."

The orders were transmitted. The camp's disintegration acquired direction — the chaos of collapse converting to the organized chaos of dispersal as unit commanders received their assignments and began moving their people toward the designated vectors.

Itzil found Kaelen. The scout was at Rainara's position — defending the water-mystic's blind spot, his blade dark with the blood of the soldiers he had intercepted. He looked at her when she approached — the pale eyes reading her face with the particular attention of a man who understood that the expression she was wearing meant something terrible was about to be said.

"Dispersal Protocol Three," she said.

He nodded. No surprise — he had been calculating the same probabilities and had arrived at the same conclusion minutes before she had. The scout's mind was always ahead of the situation, always processing the next decision while the current one was being made.

"Group B," he said. "Diversion."

"You, Rainara, Skyren. Eastern flank. Make them think the main force is breaking east. Then disappear."

"And you?"

"North. Thalendor. The main army needs a commander."

The separation was coming. They both knew it — had known it since the alarm sounded, had been preparing for it with the unconscious discipline of people who understood that the war demanded sacrifices that the heart couldn't accept and the duty couldn't refuse.

"I'll find you," she said.

He corrected her. The correction was gentle — the particular gentleness that existed between two people who were saying something that mattered more than the words could carry. "I'll find YOU. That's my job."

She almost smiled. The expression existed at the corners of her mouth — not fully formed, not the smile that other people wore, but the Itzil equivalent: a softening of the command mask that revealed, for one second, the person underneath.

Then the explosions got closer. A Dominion sorcery barrage struck fifty feet from their position — the ground erupting in a fountain of earth and stone that showered them with debris. The moment ended. The war resumed.

"Go," she said. "Now."

Kaelen turned to Rainara. The water-mystic was at the edge of her reserves — the water-wall flickering, her arms trembling, her face carrying the grey exhaustion of a person who had given everything and was discovering the shape of empty.

"Rainara — drop the wall. Save what you have. We're going east."

"The camp—"

"The camp is lost. We're the diversion now. Everything you have left — use it on the eastern flank. Make them think the whole army is coming through."

Rainara's eyes blazed — the fury that was her default state igniting one more time, converting exhaustion into action with the chemical reaction that had defined her since the dehydration cell. She dropped the water-wall.

The obsidian rain fell unimpeded. The camp's last protection vanished. Soldiers who had been fighting under the dome's cover were suddenly exposed — the black shards striking with renewed lethality, the weapon that Rainara had held at bay for fifteen minutes finally reaching its targets.

Fifteen minutes. She had held the sky for fifteen minutes against a weapon designed by the most dangerous mind on the continent. Fifteen minutes that had given the evacuation time to organize, the dispersal to begin, the alliance to convert from a camp to a movement.

Fifteen minutes that had saved thousands of lives.

Rainara turned east. The last of her reserves — the dregs of a power that had been pushed past every limit — erupted. Not a wall this time. A flood. She pulled water from the underground river — a massive, final extraction that drew the river's flow upward through the earth and redirected it eastward in a torrent that swept through the Dominion's eastern assault force like a natural disaster.

The false river. Soldiers scattered. Equipment was destroyed. The Dominion's eastern line dissolved in the face of a water-magic display that looked like the main army's full strength breaking through — the desperate, dramatic exit of a force that was abandoning its position and charging east with everything it had.

The diversion worked. Dominion commanders on the eastern flank reported a major breakout. Forces redirected east — the pursuit instinct overriding the encirclement protocol, the Dominion's eastern and southern units wheeling to intercept what they believed was the alliance's main force.

Group A moved north. Itzil at the head, Jagren commanding the rearguard, Torvane managing the evacuation through the single remaining tunnel. Four thousand soldiers streaming north — the fighting retreat that would carry them to Thalendor's border.

Group C moved south. Zariel leading the non-combatants, Neyla healing as they walked, Miyako scouting the route with shadow techniques that detected and neutralized threats before they materialized.

Group B — three people against an army — charged east. Kaelen, Rainara, Skyren. The diversion that bought the others time. The sacrifice that the war demanded and the people made.

Behind them, the base burned. Everything they had built — the command tent, the medical pavilion, the forge, the training ground, the detection network, the homes that ten thousand people had made in a hidden valley — consumed by fire and obsidian and the precise, emotionless destruction of an architect who built mechanisms and ensured they executed.

Itzil didn't look back. Looking back was a luxury that commanders couldn't afford. She moved north — through the tunnel, into the mountains, toward safety and the next phase of a war that had just entered its darkest chapter.

But she felt it. The pull. The gravity of the person moving east while she moved north. The increasing distance between them — measured not in miles but in the growing ache that existed in the space where certainty should have been.

She would find him. Or he would find her. That was the promise. That was the anchor.

The scattering was complete. The alliance was broken into three pieces. The base was gone. The war continued.

And the obsidian sky pressed down on a world that was running out of time.
