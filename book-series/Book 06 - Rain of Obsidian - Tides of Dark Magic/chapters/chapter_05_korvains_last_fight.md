Chapter 5 - KORVAIN'S LAST FIGHT

The intelligence vault smelled of burning paper and Korvain's blood was singing.

Not metaphorically — the old grandmaster's blood was actually singing, the Sun-Blade Art resonating through his circulatory system with the particular vibration that preceded manifestation. He hadn't felt it in years — the harmonic that connected the practitioner's consciousness to the blade's ancient mechanism, the bridge between will and weapon that transformed a person into a conduit for concentrated sunlight.

He was too old for this. His joints ground against each other with every movement — the cartilage worn to nothing by seven decades of martial practice, the bones meeting bone in a friction that produced pain so constant it had become background noise. His heart labored — the muscle thickened by decades of exertion, now struggling to maintain the output that combat demanded. His lungs were shallow — the capacity diminished by age and the particular damage that Nightshade's blood-magic had inflicted during the fortress battle, the vessels in his chest still carrying the inflammation that the spymaster's touch had produced.

He was too old. And the vault was full of intelligence that could not fall into Dominion hands.

Amalura worked beside him. The old scholar moved through the vault with the methodical efficiency of a person who had been organizing information for sixty years and could convert a library into a mental archive faster than most people could read a page. She was memorizing — her one good eye scanning documents with the focused intensity of a mind that processed text the way a river processed stone: continuously, thoroughly, converting physical data into mental data with a fidelity that defied the limitations of human memory.

"The relic research," she said, her hands moving through stacked folders. "The ash-oath reversal protocols. The Gate's dimensional analysis. I have all of it." She tapped her temple. "It's here. Burn the rest."

Korvain burned the rest. The portable forge that Solkren had installed in the vault for document destruction was hot — the flames consuming paper, parchment, and crystal data-storage with the systematic efficiency of fire applied to organized fuel. Intelligence reports. Tactical analyses. Communication records. The accumulated knowledge of months of war, reduced to ash.

The vault shook. The assault's concussion waves were reaching the base's interior — the deep, grinding tremors of Dominion sorcery striking the earth with the relentless pressure of a mechanism designed to collapse everything above it. Dust fell from the ceiling. The phosphorescent lights flickered.

"How much time?" Korvain asked.

"For the memorization — I'm done. For the burning — another five minutes."

"We don't have five minutes."

The corridor outside the vault produced the sound that Korvain had been waiting for — the sound that his combat instincts had been anticipating since the assault began. Footsteps. Multiple. Moving with the coordinated precision of soldiers executing an objective-specific approach.

Dominion soldiers. Not the general assault force — these were different. The footsteps were lighter, faster, the movement pattern suggesting a small, specialized team rather than a conventional infantry squad.

Korvain drew the blade from his staff.

The weapon was not the Sun-Blade — that was Itzil's, the manifestation that had chosen her as its bearer. Korvain's blade was smaller — a short sword, eighteen inches, concealed within the walking staff he had carried for decades. The blade was old — older than Korvain, older than the current conflict, forged in a tradition that predated the alliance by centuries. It was not a manifestation. It was steel.

But steel, in the hands of a grandmaster, was enough.

The first soldier appeared at the vault doorway — a Dominion heavy infantry trooper, armored, sword drawn, moving with the professional efficiency of a trained killer. Behind him, three more. A four-person breach team, assigned to secure the intelligence vault.

Korvain moved.

For six minutes — six extraordinary, impossible, glorious minutes — Korvain was the grandmaster he had been.

The Sun-Blade Art at its peak. Not the full manifestation that Itzil wielded — he was too old for that, the energy requirements exceeding what his body could generate. But the Art's foundation — the movement patterns, the combat geometry, the economy of motion that converted every ounce of available force into maximum effect — was intact. His body remembered what his joints had forgotten.

His staff-blade glowed. Not the blazing golden light of Itzil's Sun-Blade — a softer glow, amber, the color of sunset rather than noon. The light was warm — the warmth of a fire burning low, the last heat of a flame that had been bright in its time and was now approaching the end of its fuel.

The first soldier died in one stroke. Korvain's blade found the gap between helmet and gorget — the three-inch seam that existed in every suit of armor, the vulnerability that a grandmaster could locate and exploit in the time it took a lesser fighter to raise their weapon. The stroke was perfect — no wasted motion, no excess force, the blade entering and withdrawing with the clinical precision of a surgeon's instrument.

The second soldier attacked. Korvain parried — the blade deflecting the incoming strike with the angled block that redirected force rather than absorbing it, converting the soldier's momentum into a rotation that exposed his side. Korvain's riposte was instantaneous — the blade entering the exposed side with the speed of a thought completing itself.

The third and fourth attacked simultaneously — a coordinated assault from both sides, the breach team's training producing a pincer that should have overwhelmed a single defender. Korvain stepped forward — into the attack, not away from it. The step collapsed the distance, turning the pincer's geometry against itself. The soldiers' weapons crossed behind him — striking air where he had been — while his blade found them in sequence: left, right, two strokes separated by a fraction of a second, each one precise, each one terminal.

Four soldiers. Six seconds. The vault corridor was clear.

More came. Dominion reinforcements, drawn by the sound of combat, streaming through the corridor with the numerical superiority that should have overwhelmed any single defender. Korvain fought them at the doorway — the narrow space that converted the corridor into a funnel, forcing the attackers to approach one or two at a time regardless of their numbers.

He fought with the accumulated mastery of seven decades. Every strike was textbook — the forms he had taught to hundreds of students, the techniques he had refined across a lifetime of practice, the Art that was his legacy and his gift and the thing that had defined him since he first picked up a blade at the age of six.

Twelve soldiers fell. The corridor was choked with bodies. Korvain's amber glow illuminated the carnage with the warm light of a sunset that had lasted six minutes and was now fading.

His body screamed. His joints ground. His heart pounded — the rhythm irregular, the muscle struggling with the demand that combat placed on a system designed for rest. His lungs burned — the shallow capacity insufficient for the oxygen that fighting required. His hands — the strongest hands Itzil had ever known — trembled.

The amber glow dimmed. The Sun-Blade Art's residual energy was spent — the last fuel consumed, the flame that had burned bright for six extraordinary minutes guttering toward darkness.

Korvain's legs failed. The collapse was sudden — the body's systems shutting down in sequence, the joints locking, the muscles refusing the signals that the brain was sending. He fell — not dramatically, not with the theatrical grace of a warrior making a last stand. He fell the way old men fell: suddenly, gracelessly, the body simply stopping.

Amalura caught him. The old scholar — thin, frail, her own body protesting the effort — grabbed Korvain's arm and lowered him to the ground with the desperate strength of a person refusing to let someone she cared about hit the stone.

"You fool," she said. Her voice cracked — the composure that had sustained her through decades of scholarship breaking against the reality of the man in her arms. "You magnificent fool."

Korvain looked up at her. His face was grey — the color of exhaustion pushed past every limit, the color of a body that had been asked for more than it contained and had given it anyway. His breathing was labored — shallow, rapid, the sound of lungs that were failing to provide what the blood demanded.

"Burned... everything?" he managed.

"Everything that matters. The rest is in here." She touched her temple again. "They won't get it."

"Good." His eyes closed. Opened. The focus was fading — the sharp, incisive gaze that had evaluated every student, every battle, every decision in a lifetime of martial leadership softening into something gentler. "Tell Itzil..."

"Tell her yourself. We're getting out of here."

"Tell her she's ready. She's been ready. She just needs to stop asking permission."

The words settled. The vault was quiet — the sounds of battle muffled by stone, the corridor of fallen soldiers a testament to six minutes that would never be repeated. The grandmaster lay on the floor of the intelligence vault and breathed, and every breath was a victory against the body that wanted to stop.

Amalura held him. The two oldest members of the alliance — the scholar and the warrior, the mind and the blade — held each other in the wreckage of everything they had built and waited for what came next.

What came next was Nightshade.
