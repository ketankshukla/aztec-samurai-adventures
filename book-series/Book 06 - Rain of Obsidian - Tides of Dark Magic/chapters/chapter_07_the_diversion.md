Chapter 7 - THE DIVERSION

Group B hit the eastern flank like a thunderbolt thrown by three people who had nothing left to lose.

Kaelen led. The scout moved through the Dominion's eastern assault force with shadow-step precision — appearing at one position, striking, vanishing, appearing at another. The technique created the illusion of multiple fighters — each appearance registering as a separate combatant to the Dominion soldiers who were trying to track him. One man became ten. Ten became confusion. Confusion became chaos.

Rainara followed. The water-mystic had dropped her sky-shield and redirected every remaining ounce of power into the diversion. The underground river — the aquifer beneath Thornhaven that she had tapped during the defense — erupted through the earth on the eastern flank in a torrent that swept through the Dominion's assault force like a flash flood in a canyon.

The false river was devastating. Not in casualties — Rainara controlled the water's force with the precision of a surgeon, sweeping soldiers off their feet and carrying them away from the alliance's evacuation path without killing them. The goal was not destruction but disruption — converting the Dominion's organized eastern assault into a scattered, waterlogged mess that couldn't pursue anyone.

The torrent carved new channels through the valley floor — rivers where no rivers had been, water flowing in directions that defied the terrain's natural drainage because Rainara was directing it with her will rather than allowing gravity to choose its path. The Dominion soldiers fought the water the way people fought rivers: badly. Their formations dissolved. Their equipment was soaked. Their sorcerers — positioned for magical assault — found themselves waist-deep in rushing water and unable to maintain the concentration that spellcasting required.

Skyren flew above. Cielovar carried the hawk rider through the obsidian rain's thinning remnants — the golden hawk weaving between falling shards with the instinctive agility of a predator that had spent its life navigating aerial hazards. Skyren dropped Torvane's explosive charges on the Dominion's eastern supply line — the wagons and equipment that supported the assault force's logistical needs.

The explosions added to the chaos. Supply wagons detonated — ammunition, food, medical supplies converted from logistical assets into fireballs that illuminated the pre-dawn darkness and added smoke to the water and confusion that was already overwhelming the eastern flank.

The diversion worked. Dominion commanders on the eastern front reported what they perceived: a major breakout. The alliance's main force — thousands of soldiers, supported by water-magic and aerial assault — was breaking east. The report was transmitted to Valdremor's command post.

The Architect would see through it eventually. The magical signatures were wrong — three people, however powerful, produced a different energy profile than three thousand. But the report's initial transmission triggered the pursuit response that Valdremor's assault plan included for exactly this scenario: the eastern pursuit force — two thousand soldiers, held in reserve — activated and began moving east to intercept.

Two thousand soldiers pursuing three people. The diversion had drawn a significant portion of the assault force away from the other evacuation routes. Groups A and C were moving — north and south — with reduced pressure because the eastern pursuit was consuming resources that would otherwise have been used to chase them.

Kaelen signaled: DIVERSION HOLDING. PURSUIT FORCE COMMITTED EAST. GROUPS A AND C CLEAR. BEGINNING EXTRACTION.

The extraction was the part of the plan that had no plan. Three people — a scout, a water-mystic, and a hawk rider — fleeing east into wilderness with two thousand Dominion soldiers in pursuit. No supplies. No communication with the other groups. No predetermined destination.

Survive. That was the plan. Survive and regroup later.

They ran. East — through the valley's narrowing throat, into the foothills that rose toward the eastern mountain range. Kaelen navigated by instinct and memory — the terrain he had studied during Thornhaven's establishment, the escape routes he had identified as contingencies for exactly this scenario.

Rainara ran beside him. The water-mystic was spent — her reserves empty, her body running on the biological energy that remained after the magical energy was gone. She couldn't fight. She could barely move. The fury that had sustained her through the defense and the diversion was guttering — the flame that had burned so bright finally approaching the end of its fuel.

Kaelen caught her when she stumbled. His arm around her waist — the practical support of a person keeping a colleague upright, the gesture devoid of romance and full of necessity. She leaned into him for three steps. Then she found her balance and ran again.

Skyren swooped down. Cielovar landed on a rock outcropping ahead of them — the golden hawk's amber eyes scanning the terrain with the predatory efficiency of a bird that was evaluating escape routes the way a person evaluated options on a menu.

"Path clear east for two miles," Skyren reported. "Ridge line, then a forest. The pursuit is five minutes behind us — they're reorganizing after the flood but they're coming."

Five minutes. A lead that would shrink with every passing moment — the Dominion pursuit force was fresh, organized, and following a trail that three people running through mud and water had made obvious.

"The forest," Kaelen said. "Once we're under canopy, I can lose them. Shadow-step works better in enclosed terrain."

They ran. Two miles to the ridge. The foothills steepened — the terrain rising toward the eastern mountains, the ground rough with exposed rock and scrub vegetation that tore at their clothes and slowed their pace. Behind them, the sounds of pursuit — the coordinated movement of two thousand soldiers, the rhythmic impact of boots on earth, the shouted commands of officers directing the chase.

They reached the ridge. Below, the forest spread east — old-growth woodland, the canopy thick enough to block aerial observation, the undergrowth dense enough to provide concealment. Kaelen's domain. The shadow's natural habitat.

They descended into the forest. The canopy closed above them — the pre-dawn light filtering through leaves and branches, creating the dappled, shifting illumination that shadow-step was designed for. Kaelen's technique engaged at full capacity — the perceptual erasure extending to Rainara and Skyren (who had sent Cielovar ahead, the hawk too large for forest navigation).

They vanished. Three people, swallowed by the forest, invisible to the pursuit force that crested the ridge five minutes later and found... nothing. No trail. No sound. No sign of the three fugitives who had been there moments before.

The Dominion pursuit spread into the forest — two thousand soldiers searching for three people who had been trained by the best shadow master in the world. The search would continue for days. It would find nothing.

Behind them — miles behind, growing more distant with every passing minute — the base burned. Thornhaven was consumed — the hidden valley that had been home to ten thousand people for weeks now a crater of fire and obsidian and the precise, emotionless destruction of an architect who built mechanisms and ensured they executed.

Group B was in the wilderness. Cut off. Alone. Three people against the world.

Kaelen found a sheltered hollow beneath a fallen tree. Rainara collapsed into it — her body finally surrendering to the exhaustion that willpower had been holding at bay. Skyren sat beside her, the hawk rider's usual grin absent, replaced by the quiet focus of a person processing the reality that everything had changed.

"What now?" Skyren asked.

Kaelen looked east. The forest stretched toward the mountains — miles of wilderness, uncharted, unknown. Behind them, the Dominion. Ahead, nothing.

"Now we survive," he said. "And then we find the others."

"That's not much of a plan."

"It's all we have."

The forest was quiet. The pursuit was distant. The dawn was coming — the eastern sky lightening with the promise of a sun that would rise regardless of what happened to the people beneath it.

Rainara slept. Skyren watched. Kaelen planned.

The diversion had worked. The others were safe — or safer. The cost was three people stranded in wilderness with no supplies, no communication, and no way home.

The cost was acceptable. Because the alternative — the alternative where the diversion failed and the pursuit caught the other groups and the alliance died in a valley called Thornhaven — was not.

Three people. One forest. Two thousand hunters.

The serpent had shed its skin. Time to grow a new one.
