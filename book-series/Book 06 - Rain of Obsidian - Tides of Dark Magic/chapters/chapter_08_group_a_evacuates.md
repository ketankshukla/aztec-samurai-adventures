Chapter 8 - GROUP A EVACUATES

The northern tunnel was a throat of stone and Itzil's army was being swallowed by it.

Four thousand soldiers streamed through the passage — the single remaining evacuation route, a quarter-mile of underground corridor that connected Thornhaven's valley floor to an exit point in the mountains north of the base. The tunnel was narrow — wide enough for four people abreast, tall enough for a person to stand upright, the dimensions that Kaelen had specified when the evacuation routes were designed because narrow tunnels were easier to defend and harder to collapse.

Itzil stood at the tunnel's entrance. She was the last person who would enter — the commander's position, the final authority that ensured every soldier, every wounded fighter, every piece of essential equipment passed through before she followed. The Sun-Blade blazed at her hip, the golden light illuminating the entrance with the particular warmth that had become the alliance's symbol.

Behind her, the base burned. Thornhaven was being consumed — the obsidian rain had ignited the canvas structures, the Dominion's ground assault had breached the perimeter on all sides, and the evacuation's rear elements were fighting a running battle against soldiers who were pressing through the camp's wreckage with the relentless efficiency of a mechanism designed to destroy.

Jagren commanded the rearguard. The duelist stood at the rear of the evacuation column — two hundred fighters, the alliance's best, positioned between the retreating army and the Dominion's pursuit. They fought with the cold efficiency that Jagren had developed since Ashfall — no glory, no performance, just the systematic elimination of threats that approached the column's rear.

The transformation was complete. The man who had entered the war seeking glory was now a professional defender — a person who fought not for applause but for the people behind him, whose safety was measured in the distance between the rearguard and the tunnel entrance. Every minute he held was a minute the column advanced. Every soldier he stopped was a soldier who didn't reach the evacuees.

"Rearguard holding," Jagren reported through the signal relay — one of the portable units that still functioned, the communication network's last operational component. "Dominion pursuit is disorganized — the eastern diversion pulled their reserves. We're facing approximately a thousand. Manageable."

Manageable. The word carried the particular weight of a professional assessment — not optimism, not bravado, the measured judgment of a man who had learned to evaluate threats accurately and respond proportionally.

Torvane managed the column's movement. The engineer moved through the tunnel like a current through a wire — checking load-bearing walls, monitoring the passage's structural integrity, ensuring that the four thousand soldiers passing through didn't exceed the tunnel's capacity. The tunnel had been designed for evacuation — reinforced walls, ventilation shafts, emergency lighting. But it had been designed for a controlled, orderly withdrawal. What was happening was neither controlled nor orderly.

"Structural integrity at eighty percent," Torvane reported. "The Dominion's sorcery is hitting the mountain above us — concussion waves propagating through the rock. If they figure out where the tunnel is and target it directly, we have maybe five minutes before the ceiling comes down."

Five minutes. The column's transit time at current speed was twelve minutes. The math was unfavorable.

"Speed it up," Itzil ordered. "Double-time. Anyone who can't run, carry them."

The column accelerated. The sound in the tunnel changed — from the measured tramp of marching soldiers to the rapid, chaotic rhythm of people running through a stone corridor with the urgency of a population that knew the ceiling might collapse at any moment.

Itzil entered the tunnel last. She walked backward for the first hundred yards — facing south, the Sun-Blade raised, the golden light filling the tunnel behind her as a barrier that was more psychological than physical. The Dominion soldiers at the tunnel's southern entrance saw the light and hesitated — the blade's presence creating a moment of uncertainty that was all the rearguard needed to disengage and enter the tunnel behind their commander.

Jagren's rearguard filed past her. Two hundred fighters, each one moving with the efficient urgency of a soldier who understood that the race between their speed and the mountain's structural integrity was the only race that mattered.

"Everyone's in," Jagren said. He was the last fighter through — bloodied, exhausted, his sword dark with combat. "Collapse the entrance."

Torvane triggered the charges. The tunnel's southern entrance — the opening that connected the passage to Thornhaven's valley floor — detonated. Stone collapsed. The entrance sealed — tons of rock filling the passage's mouth, cutting the tunnel off from the base and the Dominion forces that occupied it.

The sound was immense. The detonation's concussion wave traveled through the tunnel like a physical force — a wall of compressed air that staggered the soldiers in the passage and produced a moment of absolute, deafening silence before the echoes resolved into the settling sounds of stone finding its new equilibrium.

"Entrance sealed," Torvane reported. "Structural integrity dropped to sixty percent from the blast. We need to move faster."

They moved faster. The column ran — four thousand soldiers sprinting through a quarter-mile of underground passage with the particular urgency of people who were between a sealed entrance and an uncertain exit. The tunnel's emergency lighting flickered — the phosphorescent crystals disrupted by the detonation, some sections dark, others strobing with the irregular pulse of damaged systems.

They reached the northern exit. The tunnel opened into a mountain valley — a cleared space between peaks, the exit concealed by an overhang that made it invisible from above. The dawn was breaking — the eastern sky lightening with the pale, cold light of an autumn morning that was indifferent to the catastrophe that had occurred beneath it.

Soldiers spilled from the tunnel exit like water from a pipe — the four-abreast column expanding into the valley, the compressed urgency of the underground passage releasing into the open air. Officers organized the column — reforming the march order, counting heads, assessing the state of the force that had just survived the most devastating attack of the war.

Itzil emerged last. She stood at the tunnel exit and looked north — toward Thalendor, toward the mountain kingdom whose borders were approximately thirty miles away. Thirty miles of mountain terrain. Hostile territory. The Dominion's pursuit force would reorganize and follow once they discovered the sealed tunnel entrance and found an alternative route.

"March north," she ordered. "Double-time to the Thalendor border. Jagren — rearguard. Torvane — scout the route. Deploy traps on every choke point."

The army moved. Four thousand soldiers — battered, exhausted, many wounded — marching north through mountain terrain at the fastest pace the column could maintain. The march was brutal — the mountain roads were narrow, steep, and unimproved. Soldiers who had been fighting minutes ago were now climbing passes and fording streams with equipment that was wet, damaged, and incomplete.

Casualties during the retreat. The rearguard engaged Dominion patrols twice — small units that had found the column's trail and were attempting to harry the retreat. Jagren handled both encounters with the efficient brutality that characterized his new combat style — quick, decisive engagements that destroyed the patrols and maintained the column's pace.

But each engagement cost. Soldiers who stayed behind to cover the column's withdrawal. Soldiers who were wounded and couldn't keep pace and had to be carried. The particular, grinding attrition of a fighting retreat through hostile territory — not the dramatic casualties of a pitched battle but the steady, continuous bleeding of a force that was being pursued and couldn't stop.

They reached the Thalendor border by nightfall. The mountain kingdom's forces met them — Brennan's pike-men, deployed along the border in defensive positions that Itzil had requested via Skyren's pre-assault reconnaissance. The Thalendor soldiers were fresh, organized, and positioned on terrain that favored defense — the mountain passes that connected the neutral zone to Thalendor's interior.

The Dominion pursuit force reached the border two hours later. They assessed the defensive positions. They assessed the fresh Thalendor troops. They assessed the terrain.

They withdrew. The pursuit was over — the cost of breaching Thalendor's border defenses exceeding the value of catching a retreating army that was now behind allied lines.

Itzil counted heads. The count took an hour — officers moving through the exhausted army, tallying the living, noting the absent.

Four thousand had entered the tunnel. Three thousand seven hundred emerged at the border. Three hundred lost during the retreat — killed, wounded beyond movement, or separated in the chaos of the march.

Three hundred. Each one a name. Each one a person who had been alive that morning and was now gone or missing because an architect had found their hiding place and brought everything.

Itzil stood at the border. The Sun-Blade was cold at her hip — the weapon's warmth diminished, the energy she had expended during the defense drawing from the blade's reserves as well as her own. She looked south — toward Thornhaven, toward the base that had been her command center, toward the place where she had stood at a ridgeline with Kaelen and watched the stars and talked about what came after.

Thornhaven was gone. The base was gone. The army was halved. Amalura was captured. Korvain was — she didn't know. The last report had been Nightshade entering the intelligence vault. After that, nothing.

The alliance was bleeding. And the war was just beginning its darkest chapter.

She turned north. Thalendor's mountain fortress waited — a temporary refuge, a place to regroup, a position from which to plan the next impossible thing.

"Set up camp," she said. "Rest the army. We start planning tomorrow."

Tomorrow. A word that contained everything — the hope that tomorrow existed, the determination that tomorrow would be used, the refusal to let the catastrophe of today become the surrender of tomorrow.

She walked into the camp. She didn't sleep. She sat at the command table — a flat rock that Torvane had designated as the temporary headquarters — and opened the first of the briefing documents that the retreat had produced.

The war continued. The alliance bled. And the commander — twenty-two years old, exhausted, carrying the weight of three hundred names she hadn't been able to save — began the work of rebuilding what the obsidian rain had destroyed.
