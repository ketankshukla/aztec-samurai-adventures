Chapter 9 - GROUP C FLEES

The children were the hardest part.

Neyla walked at the center of Group C's column — three hundred non-combatants, fifty wounded soldiers, and the particular weight of responsibility that existed when the people you were protecting couldn't protect themselves. The column moved south through forested terrain — away from Thornhaven's burning wreckage, away from the Dominion's pursuit, toward Coravel's territory where Zariel's diplomatic connections would provide sanctuary.

The non-combatants were civilians — camp followers, support staff, the families of soldiers who had joined the alliance and brought their dependents. Elderly people who moved slowly. Children who moved erratically. Wounded soldiers on stretchers who moved not at all and had to be carried by volunteers whose own strength was finite.

Neyla healed as she walked. The turquoise light flowed from patient to patient — stabilizing wounds, reducing pain, the triage healing that prioritized survival over recovery. A soldier with a deep laceration across his thigh — the turquoise light closed the wound enough to stop the bleeding but not enough to restore full function. A civilian woman with burns from the obsidian rain's dark-magic residue — the light neutralized the magical contamination but couldn't reverse the tissue damage. A child with a broken arm — the light set the bone and reduced the swelling but left the fracture partially unhealed.

Enough. Not excellence — enough. The standard that had become her operating principle since the medical pavilion at Thornhaven, since Miyako had taught her the breathing technique that made the cup larger and the refilling faster.

She breathed. Four counts in. Seven counts hold. Eight counts out. The bridge between the body's energy and the mind's energy. The technique that slowed the depletion and kept her functional when her reserves were telling her to stop.

Zariel led the column. The diplomat moved at the front with the quiet authority that characterized everything he did — the golden tongue deployed not for persuasion but for organization, the diplomatic skills that could charm an alliance summit now applied to the more immediate challenge of keeping three hundred frightened people moving through hostile territory without losing cohesion.

He was magnificent at it. The same skills that made him a master diplomat — the ability to read people, to manage emotions, to create consensus from chaos — translated directly to crisis leadership. He calmed the frightened with words that were specific rather than generic: not "everything will be fine" but "the next waypoint is two miles ahead, there's water there, we'll rest for twenty minutes." Specifics. Actionable information. The particular comfort that existed when people knew what was happening next, even if what was happening next was difficult.

He organized the march with gentle authority — assigning positions, distributing loads, rotating the stretcher-bearers so that no one carried for more than thirty minutes. The organization was invisible — the kind of leadership that people experienced as their own capability rather than someone else's direction.

Miyako scouted the route. The shadow master moved ahead of the column — invisible, silent, the perceptual erasure technique deployed at full capacity. She covered the terrain in a radius of half a mile around the column's path, searching for the threats that would turn a difficult march into a fatal one.

She found two. Dominion patrols — small units, four soldiers each, deployed along the southern approach routes to intercept exactly this kind of evacuation. The patrols were professional — positioned at terrain chokepoints, equipped with signal crystals that would transmit the column's location to the main assault force.

Miyako neutralized both. The shadow master's combat was silent — the techniques she had spent forty years perfecting applied with the particular efficiency of a person who understood that the goal was not victory but absence. The patrols ceased to exist as threats. No signal was transmitted. No alarm was raised. The column passed through the chokepoints without knowing they had been there.

She returned to the column's rear and reported to Zariel: "Route clear for the next five miles. Two patrols eliminated. No signals transmitted."

"Casualties?"

"Theirs, not ours."

Zariel nodded. The diplomat's expression carried the particular weight of a person who understood that the shadow master's efficiency came from a lifetime of practice in a skill that most people preferred not to think about. He was grateful. He was also aware that gratitude for killing was a complex emotion that deserved acknowledgment rather than enthusiasm.

The march continued. Five miles. Ten. The terrain changed — the forested mountains giving way to rolling hills, the vegetation thinning as they descended toward the lowland corridor that connected the eastern mountains to Coravel's coastal territory.

A child approached Neyla. A girl — perhaps seven years old, dark-haired, clutching a blanket that had been her bed at Thornhaven and was now the only possession she had carried from the only home she had known for the past month. Her eyes were wide — the eyes of a child processing an experience that exceeded her developmental capacity to comprehend.

"Are we going to die?" the girl asked.

Neyla knelt. The turquoise light dimmed — the healer consciously reducing her magical output to avoid frightening a child who had already been frightened enough. She looked at the girl — at the wide eyes, the clutched blanket, the particular vulnerability that existed when a child asked an adult a question and trusted the answer.

"Not today," Neyla said. "I promise."

She hated making promises. Promises in wartime were hostages to fortune — commitments that the speaker couldn't guarantee because the variables that determined outcomes were beyond any individual's control. A Dominion patrol could find them. A sorcery barrage could target the column. A hundred things could happen that would make the promise a lie.

But sometimes people needed to hear one. Sometimes the promise was not a prediction but a commitment — not "this will happen" but "I will do everything in my power to make this happen." The distinction was philosophical. To a seven-year-old with a blanket and wide eyes, the distinction was irrelevant.

"I promise," Neyla repeated. And meant it with every ounce of the determination that had sustained her through sleepless nights in the medical pavilion, through ash-oath reversals that pushed her reserves to empty, through the particular, grinding endurance that was the healer's primary weapon.

The girl nodded. She took Neyla's hand. They walked together — the healer and the child, moving south through hostile territory, connected by a promise and the turquoise warmth that flowed between them.

The column reached Coravel's territory by nightfall of the second day. The border was marked by a river — a natural boundary that Coravel's maritime forces patrolled with the professional efficiency of a nation whose wealth came from water and whose security depended on controlling it.

Zariel's diplomatic connections activated. The border garrison — alerted by pre-positioned messages that Zariel had sent through his intelligence network before the assault — was expecting them. The garrison commander met them at the river crossing — a Coravel naval officer whose uniform was immaculate and whose expression carried the particular concern of a professional encountering a refugee column.

"Ambassador Zariel. We received your message. Coravel extends sanctuary to the allied non-combatants."

"Thank you, Commander. Three hundred civilians, fifty wounded. We need medical facilities, food, and shelter."

"Arranged. The port town of Millhaven has been prepared."

The column crossed the river. The Coravel soldiers provided escort — professional, respectful, the particular courtesy that a prosperous nation extended to refugees who were also allies. The non-combatants entered Coravel's territory and the tension that had sustained them through two days of marching released — the collective exhale of three hundred people who had been holding their breath since the obsidian sky appeared above Thornhaven.

Children cried. Adults cried. The particular, messy, undignified release of people who had been through something terrible and were finally in a place where the terrible had stopped.

Neyla stood at the river crossing and looked north. The mountains were visible — dark shapes against the evening sky, the terrain that separated her from Itzil, from Kaelen, from everyone who was not in this column. The Starless Crown was visible above the northern horizon — the void growing, the darkness eating stars.

"Where are you, Itzil?" she whispered.

The mountains didn't answer. The Crown grew. The river flowed.

Group C was safe. For now. The non-combatants were protected. The wounded would be treated. The promise to the girl with the blanket was kept — for today.

Tomorrow was another promise. And tomorrow, as always, was uncertain.
