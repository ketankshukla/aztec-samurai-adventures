Chapter 10 - KORVAIN RECOVERED

Korvain arrived at Thalendor on a stretcher, and Itzil ran to him before the stretcher-bearers had finished setting him down.

He was alive. That was the first thing she confirmed — the rise and fall of his chest, the shallow but persistent breathing, the pulse at his wrist that was weak and irregular but present. Alive. The word carried a weight that exceeded its four letters, because the last intelligence she had received before the communication network collapsed was Nightshade entering the intelligence vault, and the scenarios that her mind had constructed in the hours since had been progressively worse.

He was also broken. The exertion of his last fight — six minutes of grandmaster-level combat from a body that was seventy-three years old and failing — combined with Nightshade's blood-magic paralysis had pushed his physical systems past the point of recovery. His joints were inflamed — the cartilage-less bones grinding with every movement, producing the kind of pain that made unconsciousness preferable to awareness. His heart was damaged — the muscle struggling with an irregular rhythm that Neyla, were she present, would have identified as the precursor to failure. His lungs were compromised — the blood-magic's interruption of circulation had produced fluid accumulation that made each breath a labor.

The strongest hands Itzil had ever known trembled on the stretcher's edge. The hands that had corrected her grip, demonstrated techniques, held her steady during the first manifestation — those hands were shaking with a tremor that was not fear but failure, the body's systems losing their ability to maintain the precision that had defined him.

"Korvain." She knelt beside the stretcher. The command mask was in place — the controlled expression that she had perfected over months of leadership, the face that processed catastrophe without displaying it. But her voice cracked on his name. A hairline fracture in the mask that she closed immediately but that he heard, because he had been listening to her voice since she was sixteen and could detect every variation in its frequency.

"Still here," he said. His voice was a rasp — the volume diminished to a fraction of the commanding baritone that had directed training sessions and council meetings and the particular conversations that occurred between a teacher and a student when the teacher was preparing the student for something the student didn't want to face.

"What happened?"

He told her. Slowly — the words labored, each sentence requiring breath that his lungs couldn't easily provide. The intelligence vault. The burning. The soldiers in the corridor. The six minutes. The collapse. And then Nightshade.

"She took Amalura."

The words landed. Itzil's face went through three expressions in two seconds — grief for Amalura, rage at Nightshade, and determination that the grief and rage would be converted into action. The three expressions existed simultaneously, layered on top of each other like geological strata, each one visible for a fraction of a second before the command mask reasserted and the surface became smooth again.

"Amalura surrendered to save your life," Itzil said. Not a question.

"Yes. Nightshade had my blood. If Amalura fought, I died." He closed his eyes. The admission cost him — not the physical cost of speaking but the psychological cost of acknowledging that his weakness had been the leverage that cost the alliance its most valuable non-combatant. "She chose me over the mission."

"She chose correctly."

"Did she?" The question was genuine — not rhetorical, not self-pitying. The genuine question of a man who had spent his life evaluating tactical decisions and was now evaluating one that had been made about him. "My life against her knowledge. The knowledge that the alliance needs to win the war. The knowledge that Valdremor now has access to."

"She chose correctly," Itzil repeated. The words were not a comfort — they were a judgment. The commander's evaluation of a decision that the commander agreed with, delivered with the authority that the commander had earned. "We'll get her back."

"Yes. But not yet. Not like this." Korvain opened his eyes. The gaze that met Itzil's was diminished — not in intelligence but in force. The sharp, incisive assessment that had characterized his every interaction was still present, but the energy behind it was fading. The lamp was running out of oil. "If you charge in angry, you'll lose more than her."

"I'm not angry. I'm planning."

"Good. Plan first. Then be angry."

She stayed with him. The medical staff — the Thalendor healers who had been assigned to the alliance's wounded — worked around them, treating Korvain's injuries with the methodical competence of professionals who understood that the patient on the stretcher was important to the woman kneeling beside him in ways that exceeded his military significance.

Korvain gripped Itzil's hand. His grip was weak — the strongest hands she had ever known, now trembling, the fingers unable to close fully around hers. The difference between the grip she remembered and the grip she felt was a measurement of everything the war had cost.

"I've taught you everything I know," he said. His voice was quiet — not the public voice, not the teacher's voice. The private voice. The voice that existed only in moments like this, when the student and the teacher were alone and the pretense of professional distance was unnecessary. "Everything that remains... you'll have to learn by doing."

She understood. The words were not just about combat. Not just about leadership. They were about the transition that had been approaching since the war began — the moment when the student stopped being a student and became the master. The moment when the teacher's role changed from instructor to observer. The moment when the person who had been carrying her stepped back and she discovered that she had been carrying herself for longer than she knew.

He was saying goodbye. Not to life — not yet, though the trajectory was clear. To being her protector. To the role he had occupied since she was sixteen years old — the mentor, the guide, the person who stood between her and the consequences of her inexperience. That role was ending. Not because he chose to end it but because his body was ending it for him.

"I'm not ready," she said. The words were quiet — barely audible, the admission of a person who was ready and knew it and didn't want to know it because knowing it meant accepting the reality that readiness implied.

"You've been ready for a while. You just needed to stop asking permission to lead."

She looked at him. The old man on the stretcher — frail, trembling, his body failing in ways that medicine couldn't reverse and magic could only delay. The grandmaster who had been the strongest person she had ever known, now unable to hold her hand without shaking.

She didn't argue. She didn't protest. She straightened up. She wiped her eyes — a gesture so quick and subtle that anyone who wasn't looking directly at her would have missed it. The moisture was gone. The mask was back. The commander was present.

"Rest," she said. "That's an order."

"You're ordering the grandmaster."

"I'm ordering the patient. Rest. I'll handle the war."

Korvain almost smiled. The expression was weak — a fraction of the robust, warm smile that had characterized him before the war. But it was real. The smile of a teacher watching a student become something greater than the teacher had been.

"Handle it well," he said.

She stood. She walked out of the medical tent. The Thalendor mountain air was cold — the altitude producing a chill that cut through her clothes and reached the skin. She stood in the cold and felt it and let it center her.

The student was becoming the master. Both of them knew it.

The war waited. Amalura waited. The alliance — scattered, bleeding, broken into three pieces — waited.

Itzil squared her shoulders. She walked to the command position. She opened the first briefing document.

The work of rebuilding began.
