Chapter 13 - VALDREMOR'S METHOD

Valdremor's interrogation of Amalura was not an interrogation. It was a conversation — and conversations, properly conducted, revealed more than any torture could extract.

He visited every day. The routine was precise: morning, after the detention tower's breakfast cycle, the door opening at exactly the same time. He entered with the same posture — unhurried, composed, the crystal eye and the natural eye together creating the asymmetric gaze that made every interaction feel like being examined by two different intelligences simultaneously.

He sat at the desk. He placed his hands. He asked questions.

Day one: ancient history. The pre-Gate civilization's social structure. Their magical traditions. The philosophical frameworks that had guided their approach to dimensional manipulation.

Day two: the Sun-Blade tradition. Its origins. The process of manifestation. The relationship between the bearer and the weapon. The accumulated consciousness that the blade carried from generation to generation.

Day three: the relics. Their individual properties. Their interaction patterns. The resonance that Amalura had observed when the Starshard was brought near the Sun-Blade.

Day four: the Great Gate. Its original construction parameters. The materials used. The energy requirements. The dimensional mechanics that allowed it to bridge the barrier between worlds.

Amalura refused to answer. Every day. Every question. The refusal was not dramatic — no shouting, no defiance, no theatrical resistance. She simply said nothing. Or she said irrelevant things — observations about the weather visible through her window, comments about the quality of the books on her shelf, the scholarly small talk that filled the space where answers should have been.

Valdremor didn't react. He didn't threaten. He didn't adjust his tone or his posture or his approach. He simply noted her responses — the words she used, the topics she avoided, the micro-expressions that crossed her face when certain subjects were raised.

He was building the model. The psychological map. The architecture of her knowledge rendered not through her cooperation but through her resistance — the blank spaces on the map that revealed what she was protecting by revealing what she refused to discuss.

By day seven, the model was taking shape.

Amalura's avoidance patterns were clear: she was most guarded about the Sun-Blade's relationship to the barrier. She showed the most micro-expression variation when the Gate's energy requirements were discussed. She was deliberately casual about the relics' individual properties — too casual, the relaxation performed rather than genuine.

The blank spaces told him: the Sun-Blade was connected to the barrier's creation. The Gate's energy requirements were different from what the Dominion's current calculations assumed. The relics' individual properties were less important than their combined properties — a synthesis that Amalura was protecting by directing attention toward the components rather than the whole.

By day fourteen, he had a partial copy of her knowledge. Not the knowledge itself — the structure. The framework that told him where to look, what to study, what questions to ask of other sources. The copy was incomplete — Amalura's counter-strategy was sophisticated, and she had planted false blanks that drew his attention to areas of genuine irrelevance.

But the real information — the critical intelligence that would inform the Dominion's strategy — was emerging. Not as answers but as inferences. Not as data but as patterns.

"Remarkable woman," Valdremor said to his notes on the fifteenth night. He sat in his quarters — the detention tower's upper level, a spare room that he had converted into a workspace with the same minimalist efficiency that characterized his Spire of Glass. "In another world, she'd have made an excellent Architect."

The compliment was genuine — and it was the closest thing to emotion that Valdremor had expressed since the series began. Amalura's mind was the first he had encountered that operated at his level — not in the same domain, not with the same methodology, but at the same altitude. She thought in systems. She organized in architectures. She constructed knowledge the way he constructed mechanisms — with precision, with purpose, with the understanding that the structure was as important as the content.

She was also fighting back. He could see it — the subtle distortions in her avoidance patterns, the false blanks that didn't quite match the architecture's logical structure, the deliberate misdirections that a lesser analyst would have accepted as genuine and that Valdremor recognized as the counter-moves of a mind that understood his technique and was playing the same game from the opposite side.

She was feeding him false information. Not overtly — she never spoke. But her silence was structured. The architecture of her resistance was designed to produce specific inferences — inferences that were mostly accurate but contained buried errors. Errors that, if integrated into the Dominion's strategic calculations, would produce decisions that were subtly, crucially wrong.

She was sabotaging his model from inside her cell. Without speaking a word. Without using any magic. Using only the architecture of her silence.

Valdremor smiled. The second smile in the series — brief, genuine, the expression of a man who had found an opponent worthy of his attention.

He filed the copied knowledge. He flagged the probable errors. He cross-referenced the inferences against independent sources to verify which elements were genuine and which were Amalura's planted misdirections.

The process would take time. Weeks. The verification required access to sources that even the Dominion's intelligence apparatus couldn't produce quickly — historical records, archaeological surveys, the technical analyses that only a handful of scholars in the world were qualified to perform.

But the process would produce results. Eventually. The Architect was patient. Patience was his primary tool.

He knew the Sun-Blade's limitations now — or thought he did. The blade's power was finite. The bearer's endurance determined the output duration. The manifestation required emotional commitment — the bearer had to WANT the blade to appear, which meant the blade's power was linked to the bearer's psychological state.

He knew the relic locations — or thought he did. Two in alliance hands (the Starshard and the Tide Pearl from Book 1). One in Dominion hands (the Tide-Glass, which he had taken from Relicara). Four unaccounted for — scattered across the continent in locations that the pre-Gate civilization had chosen and that only Amalura's knowledge could identify.

He knew the ash-oath reversal was possible — confirmed. The alliance had a healer who could break oaths. The technique was inefficient — one at a time, requiring enormous energy. But the principle was proven. If scaled, the technique could threaten the Gate's energy supply.

This information would drive his strategy for the rest of the war. The Sun-Blade's limitations suggested psychological warfare — attack the bearer's resolve rather than her power. The relic locations suggested acquisition campaigns — find the remaining four before the alliance did. The oath reversal suggested targeting — find the healer and neutralize her before the technique was scaled.

He filed the intelligence. He closed his notes. He looked at the detention tower's window — the northern mountains visible in the moonlight, the Starless Crown hanging above the distant capital like a crown of darkness.

The mechanism was proceeding. The Gate's energy reservoir was filling. The Crown was closing. The timeline was on track.

And the most valuable prisoner in the war was sitting in a comfortable cell, eating minimal food, drinking condensation from the windowsill, and fighting the Architect with the only weapon she had left.

Her mind.

It was almost enough.
