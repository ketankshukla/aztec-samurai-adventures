Chapter 15 - SKYREN'S FLIGHT

The longest flight of Skyren's life began with a thermal and ended with a crash.

Cielovar caught the morning updraft above the eastern forest — the golden hawk spreading its wings to their full twelve-foot span and riding the warm air upward with the effortless grace of a predator in its natural element. The altitude climbed: five hundred feet, a thousand, fifteen hundred. The forest shrank below — the green canopy becoming a textured carpet, the stream where Kaelen and Rainara waited becoming a silver thread, the wilderness becoming a map.

Three days of flying. North across hostile territory. Through Dominion patrols, aerial defenses, and the particular hazards that existed when a hawk rider flew alone through a war zone without support, communication, or a margin for error.

Skyren had made flights like this before — long-range reconnaissance missions that took her days from the nearest friendly position. But those flights had been planned. Supported. She had carried supplies, communication crystals, emergency equipment. This flight was none of those things. She carried water in a skin, dried meat in a pouch, and the signal information that would reconnect the scattered alliance.

Nothing else. No backup. No fallback. No plan B.

She loved it.

The admission was private — Skyren would never say it aloud, not in the current context of catastrophe and scattering and the particular grief that accompanied losing a home base and being separated from friends. But the truth existed in the way she sat on Cielovar's back, in the way her hands rested on the hawk's feathers, in the way her eyes scanned the horizon with the bright, focused attention of a person who was doing exactly what they were built to do.

Flying was freedom. Not metaphorically — literally. The sky had no walls. No corridors. No chokepoints where an enemy could trap you. The sky was infinite in every direction, and a hawk rider who knew the thermals and the wind patterns and the particular physics of avian flight could go anywhere, reach anyone, deliver anything.

The first day took her north across the eastern forest. Below, the Dominion pursuit force was still searching for Group B — two thousand soldiers spread across miles of woodland, the grid search producing nothing because Kaelen's shadow-step had erased every trace. From altitude, the search looked like ants wandering a garden — purposeful individually, pointless collectively.

She crossed the forest's northern edge by midday. The terrain changed — forest giving way to foothills, foothills giving way to the mountain passes that connected the eastern wilderness to the central highlands. Dominion territory. The patrol density increased — ground units moving along the mountain roads, aerial observation posts positioned on peaks that provided sightlines across the passes.

Cielovar flew high. Two thousand feet — above the range of hawk-killer bolts, above the effective altitude of wind-sorcery, above the visual detection threshold of observers who were looking for ground-level threats rather than high-altitude birds. The golden hawk was a speck against the sky — visible only to someone who knew exactly where to look and had instruments capable of tracking a fast-moving target at extreme range.

The Starless Crown was visible from altitude. The ring of void hung above the northern horizon — larger than she had ever seen it, the darkness eating stars with the patient inevitability of a process that could not be stopped. She estimated forty-five percent complete — the void nearly half-closed, the dimensional distortion measurably larger than it had been a week ago.

The Crown was accelerating. The ash-oath operations that Helisar was running — twelve cities now, thousands of new slaves feeding the Gate's energy reservoir — were increasing the rate at which the dimensional barrier thinned. The timeline that had seemed like months was compressing.

She filed the observation. Intelligence from altitude — the hawk rider's primary contribution to the war effort. Eyes in the sky. The perspective that no one else could provide.

The second day was harder. She crossed the central highlands — the mountain range that divided the continent's eastern and western halves. The passes were narrow, the winds treacherous, the thermal patterns disrupted by the particular meteorology of high-altitude mountain terrain. Cielovar fought the crosswinds with the stubborn determination of a bird that had been flying through difficult conditions for six years and had developed opinions about wind that it expressed through aggressive wing adjustments.

Dominion aerial defenses appeared twice. The first was a hawk-killer battery — a ground-based launcher that fired crystal-tipped bolts designed to track and destroy airborne targets. The bolts were fast — faster than crossbow quarrels, guided by magical tracking that locked onto the target's heat signature. Skyren evaded by diving — dropping below the bolts' tracking altitude, the vertical evasion that exploited the weapons' horizontal bias.

The second was worse. Trained raptors — Dominion war-birds, bred and conditioned for aerial combat. Three of them — large, dark-feathered, their eyes carrying the glazed focus of birds under magical control. They rose from a mountain perch and vectored toward Cielovar with the coordinated precision of predators executing a trained attack pattern.

Cielovar was faster. The golden hawk's speed — the product of six years of flight conditioning and the natural advantage of a species bred for velocity — exceeded the war-birds' capability by a significant margin. Skyren leaned forward, reducing wind resistance, and Cielovar accelerated — the hawk's wings driving with the powerful, rhythmic strokes that converted biological energy into aeronautical speed.

The war-birds fell behind. Their magical conditioning kept them in pursuit for approximately five miles before the controller's range was exceeded and the birds broke off, returning to their perch with the confused circling of animals whose instructions had ceased.

The third day brought Thalendor.

The mountain kingdom appeared below like a fortress built by geology — the peaks rising in concentric rings, the valleys between them terraced and cultivated, the stone cities visible as clusters of grey and brown against the mountain's green and grey. Thalendor was beautiful — the particular beauty of a civilization that had learned to build with its environment rather than against it, the stone structures emerging from the mountain as naturally as the peaks themselves.

Skyren descended. The altitude dropped — two thousand feet to a thousand, a thousand to five hundred. She could see the allied camp now — a military encampment on Thalendor's southern border, the tents and fortifications of Itzil's Group A visible as an organized pattern against the mountain's slope.

She was exhausted. Three days of flying — the physical strain of maintaining position on a hawk's back through wind and cold and the particular fatigue that altitude produced in a human body not designed for sustained flight. Her muscles ached. Her skin was wind-burned. Her lips were cracked. She had eaten the last of her dried meat that morning and drunk the last of her water at noon.

Cielovar was tired too. The hawk's powerful strokes had slowed — the rhythm that had been effortless on the first day now requiring visible effort, the bird's reserves depleting after three days of sustained flight without the rest periods that normal operations provided.

The landing was not graceful. Skyren aimed for the camp's open area — the cleared space that every military camp maintained for assembly and logistics. Cielovar descended in a spiral — the controlled approach that the hawk normally executed with elegant precision. But fatigue disrupted the precision. The spiral tightened. The descent steepened. The hawk's wings, exhausted from three days of flight, couldn't maintain the controlled glide that a proper landing required.

They crashed. Not catastrophically — the hawk managed to arrest most of the descent velocity before contact. But the landing was hard — Cielovar's talons hitting the ground with enough force to send Skyren tumbling from the bird's back, the hawk rider rolling across the cleared area and coming to rest in a heap of windburn, exhaustion, and the particular indignity of a spectacular entrance that was spectacular for the wrong reasons.

Allied soldiers converged. Hands helped her up. Water was offered. A medic began checking for injuries.

Skyren looked up. Through the crowd of soldiers, she saw Itzil — the commander pushing through the assembled troops with the focused urgency of a person who recognized the arrival's significance.

"Skyren." Itzil's voice carried the controlled relief of a commander receiving intelligence she desperately needed. "Report."

"Group B is alive," Skyren said. Her voice was rough — three days of cold air and dehydration had stripped it of smoothness. "Kaelen, Rainara, and me. Eastern wilderness. Rainara can track Amalura — she's being held in a northern detention tower. Kaelen has a plan."

"A plan for what?"

"Everything. Regrouping. Rescue. The next phase." Skyren managed a grin — weak, wind-burned, but genuine. The hawk rider's irrepressible optimism, surviving three days of solo flight through hostile territory. "He says to tell you: rendezvous at Hidden Valley. Seven days. Bring everyone."

Itzil's face changed. The command mask held — it always held — but beneath it, the relief was visible. The scattered pieces were reconnecting. The alliance was not dead. The war continued.

"Tell them to hold position," Itzil said. "We're coming to them."

Skyren nodded. Then she sat down — not gracefully, not with the controlled descent of a person managing her posture. She sat the way exhausted people sat: suddenly, the body's reserves finally reaching zero.

"I could use a meal," she said. "And Cielovar needs a whole deer."

The golden hawk, perched at the clearing's edge, fixed the nearest soldier with an amber stare that communicated exactly the same request with considerably less diplomacy.

The flight was done. The message delivered. The scattered alliance had a rendezvous point and a timeline.

Seven days. Hidden Valley. Everyone.

The reunion was coming. And with it, the next impossible thing.
