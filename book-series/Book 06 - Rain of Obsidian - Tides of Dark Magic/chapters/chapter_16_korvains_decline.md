Chapter 16 - KORVAIN'S DECLINE

The mountain air was thin and cold and Korvain was breathing less of it every day.

Itzil visited him each morning — the ritual that had replaced the training sessions they used to share, the commander checking on the grandmaster the way the student had once checked on the teacher. The dynamic had inverted. She was the strong one now. He was the one who needed checking.

The Thalendor healers had done what they could. The inflammation from Nightshade's blood-magic had been reduced — the vessels in his chest no longer swollen, the fluid in his lungs partially drained. The joint damage had been managed — anti-inflammatory compounds, supportive bracing, the palliative care that reduced pain without reversing the underlying degeneration. The heart irregularity had been stabilized — medication that maintained the rhythm within acceptable parameters, the pharmacological equivalent of propping up a wall that was slowly falling.

But the trajectory was clear. The exertion of his last fight — the six glorious minutes in the intelligence vault — had accelerated the decline that age had been producing for years. His body was shutting down. Not dramatically, not catastrophically. Gradually. The systems that had maintained the grandmaster's physical capability for seven decades were winding down with the particular inevitability of mechanisms that had exceeded their design lifespan.

He could no longer walk without support. His hands — the instruments of a lifetime of martial mastery — shook too much to hold a blade. His breathing was labored — each breath requiring conscious effort, the automatic process that most people never noticed becoming a task that demanded attention.

The conversation happened on the fifth day in Thalendor. Itzil sat beside his bed — a camp cot in the medical tent, the rough accommodation that was the best the field conditions could provide. The morning light filtered through the canvas, casting the space in the warm amber tones that characterized mountain sunrises.

"I'm dying, Itzil." His voice was quiet — not the commanding baritone that had directed training sessions and council meetings but a diminished version, the volume reduced to match the energy available. "Not today, maybe not this month. But soon."

"Don't—"

"Listen. This is my last lesson."

She closed her mouth. The impulse to protest — to deny, to deflect, to convert the conversation into something less final — was strong. But Korvain had said listen, and she had spent six years learning that when Korvain said something, it was worth listening to.

"Leadership isn't about strength," he said. "I know you think it is — you've been strong for months, carrying this alliance on your shoulders like a weight you can't put down. But strength is a tool. Leadership is something else."

"What?"

"Presence. Showing up. Every time. Even when you don't know the answer. ESPECIALLY when you don't know the answer." He paused — the pause of a man whose lungs required rest between sentences. "The people who follow you — they don't need you to be right. They need you to be THERE. Present. Visible. The person who stands up when everyone else wants to sit down."

"That's not enough."

"It's everything. The strategy — Kaelen handles that. The engineering — Torvane. The healing — Neyla. The diplomacy — Zariel. You've built a team that covers every capability. Your job isn't to do what they do. Your job is to be the reason they do it."

She looked at him. The old man on the cot — frail, diminished, the body that had been the most capable physical instrument she had ever known reduced to something that couldn't hold a cup without shaking. And the mind — clear, precise, undimmed — still teaching. Still present. Still showing up.

The irony was not lost on her. His final lesson was about showing up. And he was demonstrating it from a sickbed.

She broke down. The tears came — not the dramatic, public tears that leaders sometimes displayed for effect but the quiet, private tears of a person who was losing someone they loved and was finally allowing the loss to be real. She cried — silently, her shoulders shaking, the command mask dissolving for the first and only time before Book 8.

Korvain held her. His arms were frail — the embrace that had once been the strongest, most reassuring thing in her world now weak, trembling, the muscles unable to provide the compression that comfort required. But the arms were there. The presence was there. The person was there.

"You're ready," he said. His voice was steady — the one thing about him that hadn't diminished, the voice that had trained and guided and comforted her for six years. "You have been for a while. You just needed to stop asking permission to lead."

She straightened up. The tears were wiped — a gesture so quick and practiced that it might have been habit, the automatic response of a person who had learned that commanders couldn't cry in public and was now applying the lesson even in private.

"I'm not asking permission," she said. "I'm asking for advice."

"Different thing. Better thing."

"The rescue. Amalura. What would you do?"

"What I always did. What you always do. Show up. Plan as well as you can. Trust the team. And when the plan fails — because it always fails — be present for the improvisation."

"That's not very specific."

"The specific part is Kaelen's job. Your job is to make sure Kaelen has what he needs to do his job. And Rainara. And Skyren. And all of them. You're the hub, Itzil. Not the spoke. The hub doesn't spin — it holds everything together while the spokes do the spinning."

She nodded. The metaphor was clumsy — Korvain was a swordsman, not a poet. But the meaning was clear. Leadership was not action. Leadership was the thing that made action possible.

She stood. She looked at him one more time — the grandmaster, the teacher, the person who had shaped her from a sixteen-year-old with potential into a twenty-two-year-old with an army. The person who was leaving.

"I'll come back," she said. "Every morning."

"I'll be here." A pause. "For a while."

She left the medical tent. The mountain air hit her — cold, thin, the altitude producing a clarity that felt like being cleaned. She stood in the air and breathed it and let the cold burn away the tears and the grief and the conversation that had been, she now understood, the last real teaching she would receive from the person who had taught her everything.

She walked to the command position. She opened the strategic assessment. She began planning the reunion — the convergence of the scattered groups at Hidden Valley, the first step in the sequence that would lead to Amalura's rescue and the continuation of the impossible war.

The student was becoming the master. The lesson was presence. The price was everything.

She showed up. She planned. She led.

It was enough. It had to be.
