Chapter 17 - REGROUPING

Itzil sent the message through Rainara's water-communication network and the scattered alliance began to move.

RENDEZVOUS AT HIDDEN VALLEY. SEVEN DAYS. BRING EVERYONE.

The message propagated through the continental water system — vibrating through rivers and streams and aquifers, the signal degrading with distance but maintaining enough coherence to reach every allied group that was near a water source. Which was everyone, because water was everywhere and Rainara's technique exploited the fundamental ubiquity of the element that defined her.

Kaelen's reply vibrated back within hours: ON OUR WAY. WE HAVE A PLAN FOR AMALURA.

The logistics of moving three scattered groups to a single rendezvous point through hostile territory were brutal. Each group faced different challenges. Each challenge required different solutions. The coordination — managed through water-communication that was slow, imprecise, and energy-intensive — was the most complex operational task the alliance had attempted since the Serpent's Gambit.

Group A — Itzil's main army — moved south from Thalendor. Three thousand seven hundred soldiers, plus the wounded and the command infrastructure. The march required crossing the mountain passes that connected Thalendor to the central highlands — terrain that was defensible but slow, the narrow roads limiting the column's speed to approximately fifteen miles per day.

Torvane managed the route. The engineer's analytical mind converted the movement problem into a logistics equation — calculating march rates, supply consumption, rest requirements, and the probability of Dominion contact at each waypoint. The calculation produced a seven-day timeline that required the column to maintain pace without significant delays.

Jagren commanded the march security — the advance guard, flank screens, and rear guard that protected the column from the Dominion patrols that were still searching for the scattered alliance. His security teams operated with the quiet efficiency that had become Jagren's signature — professional, thorough, devoid of the theatrical energy that had characterized his earlier approach to combat.

Group B — Kaelen, Rainara — moved west from the eastern wilderness. Two people, traveling light, navigating by Kaelen's terrain memory and Rainara's water-sense. Their route avoided the Dominion's eastern pursuit force — the two thousand soldiers still searching the forest for targets that had vanished — and crossed the foothills through passes that only a scout with Kaelen's experience would know.

Rainara's recovery continued during the march. Her reserves refilled slowly — the magical energy regenerating at a rate that was frustratingly gradual but steadily increasing. By the third day, she could maintain the water-communication network while walking — the dual-processing that allowed her to relay messages between the groups while covering ground.

She tracked Amalura continuously. The old scholar's signature remained stationary — the detention tower in the Dominion's northern territories, the fixed point that would become the rescue operation's target. The signature was stable — Amalura was alive, conscious, and maintaining the biological patterns that indicated health rather than distress.

She was fighting. Rainara could feel it in the signature's quality — a subtle variation that distinguished a person who was at rest from a person who was actively resisting. Amalura's moisture signature carried the particular tension of a mind under pressure — the biological correlate of cognitive effort, the body's water responding to the brain's activity with increased circulation and elevated metabolic markers.

"She's still resisting," Rainara told Kaelen. "Her body signature shows sustained cognitive effort. She's not resting. She's working — fighting Valdremor's interrogation with everything she has."

"Of course she is. That's Amalura."

Group C — Zariel, Neyla, Miyako — moved north from Coravel's territory. The non-combatants remained in Coravel — safe, sheltered, protected by the diplomatic arrangements that Zariel had established. The three alliance members traveled with a small escort — twenty Coravel soldiers provided by the maritime nation's government as a gesture of alliance solidarity.

Zariel's diplomatic network facilitated the movement. The ambassador's contacts across the continent's neutral territories provided safe houses, supply points, and intelligence about Dominion patrol routes. The journey was managed with the elegant efficiency that characterized everything Zariel did — each waypoint planned, each contingency prepared, each interaction with local contacts conducted with the diplomatic grace that converted potential obstacles into willing assistance.

Neyla carried something new. The resonance frequency discovery — the technique that could break ash-oaths cleanly by matching the binding's harmonic — was documented in her journal, the methodology preserved in writing that she kept on her person at all times. The discovery was potentially the most important tactical development of the war — a scalable technique for mass liberation that could threaten the Gate's energy supply if deployed effectively.

She practiced during the march. Every water source they passed — every stream, every well, every rain puddle — she tested the technique. Sending the resonance frequency through the water, feeling for the ash-oath signatures that existed in the enslaved populations miles away. The technique was theoretical at this distance — she couldn't break oaths at range, not yet. But the sensing was possible. She could feel the oaths — thousands of them, spread across the continent, the crimson threads that connected enslaved consciousness to the Great Gate.

Miyako scouted the route — the shadow master moving ahead of the group with the invisible efficiency that decades of practice had produced. Her observations were tactical — patrol positions, terrain features, threat assessments. But her mind was elsewhere.

Her home city was under Helisar's control. The news from Book 5 had been confirmed by Zariel's intelligence network — the shadow school she had built, the students she had trained, the colleagues she had worked with, all of them processed into ash-oaths. The people who had defined her professional life for decades were now enslaved.

She trained harder during the rest stops. Pushing her aging body with an intensity that Zariel noticed and Neyla worried about. The shadow master was preparing for something. The resolve that had crystallized in Book 5 — the decision to return to her home city — was hardening into a plan that she hadn't shared with anyone.

Seven days. The three groups moved through the continent — north, west, north — converging on a hidden valley in the neutral zone between Thalendor and the eastern wilderness. A valley that Kaelen had identified during the alliance's original reconnaissance — a defensible position, concealed from aerial observation, accessible through narrow passes that could be defended.

Hidden Valley. The rendezvous. The place where the scattered pieces would reconnect and the alliance would discover whether the breaking had destroyed them or forged them into something stronger.

The water carried the messages. The mountains carried the marchers. The sky carried the hawk.

And the Starless Crown carried the countdown — the void growing above the northern horizon, the darkness eating stars, the clock that measured the time they all had left.

Seven days. Then the reunion. Then the next phase.

Then the rescue. Then the war.

Then whatever came after — if "after" still existed when the Crown finished closing.
