Chapter 22 - HELISAR'S EXPANSION

Helisar stood in the processing chamber of Ashenmoor's conversion facility and watched his life's work operate with the beautiful, terrible efficiency of a system performing exactly as designed.

The chamber was large — a converted warehouse near the city's central square, repurposed from grain storage to consciousness harvesting with the practical adaptations that Helisar's engineers had perfected over twelve cities. Stone walls lined with absorption sigils that captured the energy released during the binding process. A central altar of obsidian where the subjects were placed — one at a time, face up, their eyes open because Helisar insisted on eye contact during the procedure. Processing stations along the walls where the newly-oathed were catalogued, numbered, and assigned to their work details.

The assembly line of enslavement. Efficient. Organized. Running at a rate of approximately two hundred conversions per day — the output of a system that Helisar had refined through iteration and improvement until it operated with the precision of a factory producing a standardized product.

He watched a conversion in progress. The subject was a young man — perhaps twenty, dark-haired, his face carrying the particular expression of a person who was conscious enough to understand what was happening and powerless to prevent it. The ash-oath sigil was forming on his chest — the crimson mark materializing as Helisar's sorcerers channeled the binding energy through the obsidian altar and into the subject's consciousness.

The young man's eyes went blank. The awareness — the spark of individual identity that made a person a person rather than a component — dimmed. The consciousness was drawn out — not destroyed but redirected, the stolen awareness flowing through the crimson threads that connected every ash-oath to the Great Gate's energy reservoir.

Another soul harvested. Another identity erased. Another unit of energy feeding the Gate's activation sequence.

Helisar felt satisfaction. Not the cruel satisfaction of a sadist — the professional satisfaction of a craftsman observing his work perform at peak efficiency. He did not see cruelty in the ash-oath process. He saw liberation — the removal of the chaos of individual consciousness, the integration of human energy into a purpose greater than any individual life could achieve.

"I free them from the chaos of choice," he had told Volzentar. "They serve a purpose greater than themselves."

He believed it. The belief was genuine — not the performed conviction of a person rationalizing evil but the deep, structural certainty of a person whose worldview was fundamentally different from the heroes' and who was, within the framework of that worldview, acting with integrity.

He reported to Volzentar through the communication crystal — the encrypted channel that connected the emperor's office to every operational commander in the field. Twelve cities. Thousands of new slaves. The Gate's energy reservoir was growing rapidly.

Volzentar was pleased. The emperor's voice carried the controlled satisfaction of a strategic mind whose plan was progressing ahead of schedule. "Excellent. The Crown needs more power. How many more can you process?"

Helisar hesitated. The hesitation was brief — a fraction of a second, the micro-pause that preceded an admission that the speaker didn't want to make. "There are limits. The human soul resists. The more you take, the more it fights."

The observation was genuine. Helisar had noticed something during the past week — a change in the binding process that he couldn't explain through normal operational variables. The ash-oaths were weakening. Not dramatically — the bindings still held, the consciousness was still redirected, the energy still flowed. But the process required more effort. The sorcerers reported increased resistance during conversion. The newly-oathed showed moments of awareness that shouldn't have been possible — flickers of individual consciousness breaking through the binding's suppression.

Someone was pulling at the threads of his work.

The realization was troubling. The ash-oath system was Valdremor's design — the Architect's most sophisticated creation, a binding protocol that had been tested and refined and optimized until it was, in theory, unbreakable. If the bindings were weakening, the cause was external — an interference with the system's fundamental mechanism that originated from outside the Dominion's control.

A healer. The intelligence had been accumulating — reports from field agents, intercepts from the alliance's communication network, the analytical synthesis that Nightshade's apparatus produced. The alliance had a healer who could weaken ash-oaths. The technique was new — developed during the war, refined through practice, capable of cracking the outer layers of a binding in a single session.

If the technique improved — if the healer found a way to break oaths cleanly — the implications were catastrophic. The Gate's energy reservoir depended on the continuous flow of stolen consciousness from the ash-oathed populations. Interrupt that flow — break the oaths at scale — and the reservoir would drain. The Crown's growth would slow. The Gate's activation timeline would extend.

Helisar composed a report. The report was directed not to Volzentar but to Nightshade — the spymaster whose operational reach could find and neutralize specific targets with the precision that Helisar's broad operations lacked.

"There's a healer in their ranks who can weaken ash-oaths. Find her. I need to study her."

The report was transmitted. Through the encrypted channel, across the continent, to the intelligence wing where Nightshade's apparatus processed every piece of information that the Dominion's network produced.

The Dominion now knew about Neyla's ability. The healer who had discovered the resonance frequency — the technique that could break ash-oaths cleanly, the method that could change the war — had just become the Dominion's number one target.

Not Itzil. Not the Sun-Blade. Not the scattered alliance's military capability.

Neyla. The quiet healer with the turquoise light and the exhaustion-darkened eyes and the stubborn, relentless refusal to stop healing people even when her reserves told her to stop.

The most dangerous person in the alliance was not the one with the golden blade. It was the one with the gentle hands.

And the Dominion had just figured that out.

Helisar returned to the processing chamber. The assembly line continued — consciousness harvested, identities erased, energy flowing. The system performed as designed.

But the threads were weakening. Somewhere, someone was pulling. And the pulling would not stop.
