- **Kaelen** — Scout and infiltrator. Leading Group B's diversion, then stranded in the eastern wilderness with Rainara and Skyren.
- **Jagren** — Duelist and rearguard commander. Fights with cold efficiency during the retreat — the transformation from performer to professional is complete.
- **Neyla** — Healer. Protecting non-combatants in Group C. Discovers the resonance frequency that breaks ash-oaths cleanly.
- **Torvane** — Engineer. Managing evacuation logistics and deploying traps to slow Dominion pursuit.
- **Miyako** — Shadow school master. Scouting and neutralizing threats for Group C. Preparing to return to her ash-oathed home city.
- **Amalura** — Lorekeeper. Captured by Nightshade. Imprisoned in a Dominion detention tower. Fighting back by feeding Valdremor false information.
- **Korvain** — Itzil's mentor. Fights his last battle defending the intelligence vault. His body is failing. His final lessons shape everything that follows.
- **Zariel** — Diplomat-spymaster. Leading Group C south to Coravel's territory with the non-combatants.
- **Skyren** — Hawk rider. Part of Group B's diversion. Flies the longest solo mission of the war to reconnect the scattered groups.
- **Rainara** — Water-knot mystic. The alliance's primary shield during the assault. Develops long-range water-communication. Focus character of this book.
- **Solkren** — Armorer. Quiet, present, working. Serenthar's prophecy names him as the key to the future no one is watching.

## The Dominion

- **Volzentar** — Emperor. The strategic mind directing the war's endgame.
- **Valdremor** — The Architect. Designs and executes the surgical assault on the alliance's base. Interrogates Amalura through conversation, not torture.
- **Nightshade** — Spymaster. Captures Amalura through blood-portal infiltration. Identifies Neyla as the Dominion's next priority target.
- **Helisar** — Ash-oath master. Expanding operations to twelve cities. Notices the oaths weakening — someone is pulling at the threads of his work.
- **Serenthar (The Weeping One)** — Demon-bound seer. Visits Amalura in the detention tower. Cryptic prophecy: "The one that depends on an armorer no one is watching."
