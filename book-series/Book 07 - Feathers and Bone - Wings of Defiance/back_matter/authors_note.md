# Author's Note

Thank you for reading *Feathers and Bone*.

I knew Miyako was going to die from the moment I outlined this series. I knew it when I wrote her first scene. I knew it when she taught Kaelen the shadow-step. I knew it when she told Itzil, "You don't need to be perfect. You just need to be there."

Knowing didn't make it easier.

Miyako's arc is about atonement. She ran from her home city. She carried the guilt for decades. She spent a lifetime building the skills that would eventually bring her back. And when she went back — when she descended into the temple basement and destroyed the anchor that enslaved her people — she did it knowing the cost.

The cost was everything. And she paid it without hesitation.

The Kanezawa sequence was the hardest thing I've written in this series. Not because the action was complex — the action was straightforward. A shadow master descends, destroys an anchor, fights her way out. What made it hard was the knowledge, on every page, that the woman doing these extraordinary things was doing them for the last time.

Helisar's crack — the four words on the wall, "I REMEMBER MY NAME" — is the moment where the villain's certainty begins to fracture. Not dramatically. Not with a conversion or a revelation. Just a crack. A space where doubt can enter. Because the most dangerous thing you can do to a person's belief system is show them evidence that contradicts it and let them sit with it.

And Skyren. The hawk rider who sees everything from above and who Miyako told to land. To see the faces. To remember that every pattern is made of people. That lesson — "don't forget to land" — is the thread that connects the book's aerial perspective to its ground-level grief.

Feathers and bone. What remains when the spirit leaves. The physical evidence of a life lived fully, spent completely, given without reservation.

The team is nine now. The war continues. Book 8 brings the rescue of Amalura and the race for the Sunheart.

But tonight — if you'll permit me — tonight is for Miyako. The exile sensei. The woman who ran and spent a lifetime returning.

She showed up. At the end, she was there.

With gratitude and grief,
Ketan Shukla
