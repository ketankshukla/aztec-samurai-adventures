# A Quick Favor

If Miyako's story meant something to you, would you consider leaving a review on Amazon?

Reviews help other readers find the series. And they help me keep writing stories about people who show up — even when showing up costs everything.

Even a single sentence:

> *"I wasn't ready for this book because..."*

Thank you for reading. Thank you for caring about these characters. And thank you for being there — the way Miyako taught us to be.
