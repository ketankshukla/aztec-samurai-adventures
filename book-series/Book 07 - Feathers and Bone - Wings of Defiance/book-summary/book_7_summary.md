# Aztec Samurai Adventures Book 7: Feathers and Bone - Wings of Defiance

The first beloved hero dies. Miyako's arc — from exile to atonement to sacrifice — reaches its devastating conclusion.

Skyren spots a massive ash-oath slave column heading toward Kanezawa, Miyako's home city. The shadow master goes to Itzil: "I need to go to Kanezawa. Not for the war. For the people I left behind." Before leaving, she tells Itzil: "You don't need to be perfect. You just need to be there." It sounds like a farewell. It is.

Skyren flies Miyako south to join Neyla and Zariel. They infiltrate Kanezawa disguised as refugees. The city is beautiful and wrong — clean streets, ordered people, no laughter, no arguments, no life. Helisar greets them personally: "Welcome. You'll find peace." Miyako trembles with contained rage. This is HER city. These are HER people.

The operation: Neyla reverses oaths one at a time. Miyako descends to the temple basement to destroy the oath-anchor — a massive crystal pillar connecting every ash-oath in the city. She fights through guards with devastating precision. Drives her blade into the anchor's flaw. The crystal cracks. Every oath in the city weakens simultaneously. Neyla's reversals accelerate from minutes to seconds. Five thousand people freed.

Miyako fights her way up through the temple — level by level, wound by wound. Twenty guards between her and daylight. She breaks the formation with raw skill. Reaches the doors. Sunlight. Zariel with a horse. They ride. Skyren covers the evacuation with twelve hawks. Five thousand refugees cross the river to safety.

Helisar surveys his ruins. A freed person scratched four words into the wall: "I REMEMBER MY NAME." For the first time, a crack in his certainty. He stares at the words for a very long time.

The alliance reunites at Hidden Valley. The last time all ten heroes are together. They laugh. Jagren tells a story. Even Torvane smiles. Savor it.

Intelligence arrives: the Dominion needs the Sunheart relic to complete the Gate. It's a race to the original Sun-Blade temple. The army marches south. Miyako volunteers for the forward scout team despite her injuries. She teaches Kaelen the shadow-fade — her final technique. "That sounds like a goodbye." "It sounds like a lesson. The last one I have."

Korvain and Miyako share their last twilight. "What does Itzil still need?" "To lose us. Both of us. And survive it."

The ambush. A Dominion screening force on the southern road. Miyako fights in the forward line. A war-beast breaks through toward the medical corps. Miyako intercepts — a sixty-three-year-old woman against a creature five times her size. She drives it back. Then collapses.

The team gathers. She speaks to each of them. Her breathing slows. Then stops.

Miyako dies. The exile sensei. The woman who ran from her duty and spent a lifetime returning to it. She died surrounded by the people she loved, having saved the city she abandoned.

Skyren releases Cielovar with a feather from Miyako's cloak. The hawk circles once, cries, and flies south. Feathers and bone — what remains when the spirit leaves.

The army marches on. Itzil leads. She doesn't look back. She doesn't need to. Miyako is with her now — in every step, in every time she shows up.
