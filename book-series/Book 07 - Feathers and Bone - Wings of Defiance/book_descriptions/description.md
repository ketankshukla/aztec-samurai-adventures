# Book Description — Aztec Samurai Adventures Book 7: Feathers and Bone - Wings of Defiance

## Subtitle: Wings of Defiance

---

<b>A shadow master returns to the city she abandoned. A healer frees a city. And the first beloved hero falls.</b>

<p>Miyako has carried the guilt for decades. She ran from her home when the war came. The people she left behind were enslaved. Now, with nothing left to lose and everything left to prove, she goes back.</p>

<p><b>In this book:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>An infiltration into a city-sized ash-oath factory — where people move in perfect order and no one laughs</li>
<li>A healer who frees over two hundred people in a single morning — and breaks when she realizes it's not enough</li>
<li>A shadow master who descends into a temple basement, destroys the anchor that enslaves a city, and fights through twenty guards to reach the light</li>
<li>Four words scratched into a wall that crack a villain's certainty: "I REMEMBER MY NAME"</li>
<li>A race for the relic that will determine whether the world survives</li>
<li>The death that changes everything</li>
</ul>

<p>Feathers and Bone is the most emotionally devastating book in the series — the moment where the war takes someone the heroes can't afford to lose, and the reader discovers that grief and courage are made of the same material.</p>

<p>For fans of <i>The Hero of Ages</i>, <i>The Realm of the Elderlings</i>, and stories where the teacher's final lesson is the one that echoes longest — a book about showing up, even when showing up costs everything.</p>

<p><i>"Keep flying, hawk girl. The sky is the only honest place left."</i></p>

<p><b>Book 7 of 12 in the <i>Aztec Samurai Adventures</i> series. From Ketan Shukla, published by Metronagon.</b></p>
