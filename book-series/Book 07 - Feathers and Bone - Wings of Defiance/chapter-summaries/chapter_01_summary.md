# Chapter 1 Summary — WINGS OVER WAR

**POV:** Skyren

Skyren flies reconnaissance over the continent — mapping devastation, troop positions, patrol lines. Cielovar has developed near-telepathic bond. Each flight is a gauntlet of hawk-killer crossbows, wind-sorcery, and trained raptors. She's been hit twice.

She spots a massive ash-oath slave column heading toward Kanezawa — Miyako's former home city. Helisar is expanding his operation there.

**Key Events:** Aerial reconnaissance mapped, anti-air defenses described, slave column spotted heading to Kanezawa, intelligence delivered to Itzil.

**Cliffhanger:** Miyako hears the news. Her jaw sets. The resolution is absolute. "How far?" "Two days' march."
