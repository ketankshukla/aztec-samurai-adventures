# Chapter 4 Summary — THE FACTORY CITY

**POV:** Neyla

Kanezawa is beautiful and wrong. Clean streets, ordered people, no laughter. Neyla feels the wrongness through her healing sense — every person's biological signature identical. Miyako recognizes faces: the flower seller, the teacher, a girl who looks like a student she loved.

They infiltrate as refugees. Inside the temple processing center: people in neat rows, sorcerers pressing ash-oath sigils. The victims don't scream. They just go still. Neyla's hands shake.

**Key Events:** City's wrongness described, Miyako recognizes enslaved people, infiltration as refugees, processing lines witnessed.

**Cliffhanger:** The factory operates. The machine's appetite is constant. And the shadow master opens her eyes and begins planning its destruction.
