# Chapter 5 Summary — THE SAINT'S WELCOME

**POV:** Miyako

Helisar appears — gentle, warm, welcoming. "Welcome to Kanezawa. You'll find peace." Miyako trembles with contained rage beneath her stillness. She sees familiar faces among the enslaved: the flower seller, the teacher, a girl who looks like a student she loved.

Helisar leads them to guest quarters. At the door: "You look familiar. Have we met?" Miyako: "No." He smiles: "Strange. I never forget a face."

**Key Events:** Helisar's genuine warmth described, Miyako's contained fury, familiar faces recognized, Helisar suspects familiarity.

**Cliffhanger:** Helisar never forgets a face. Dawn is coming. And with it, the reckoning.
