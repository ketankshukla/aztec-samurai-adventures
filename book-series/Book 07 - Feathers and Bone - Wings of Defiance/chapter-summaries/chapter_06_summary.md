# Chapter 6 Summary — THE PLAN

**POV:** Zariel

Three objectives: free slaves, shut down factory, evacuate survivors. Force multiplier: destroy the central oath-anchor in the temple basement — weakens every oath simultaneously. Neyla can then break weakened oaths rapidly.

Miyako: "I'll handle the anchor." No room for argument. Zariel sends message to Skyren: "Be ready for mass evacuation." Skyren responds: twelve hawks ready.

**Key Events:** Three-objective plan established, oath-anchor identified as target, Miyako claims anchor mission, Skyren's aerial evacuation prepared, dawn timeline set.

**Cliffhanger:** Dawn. Six hours. Three objectives. One anchor. One shadow master. And her final mission.
