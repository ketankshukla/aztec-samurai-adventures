# Chapter 7 Summary — NEYLA VS. THE OATHS

**POV:** Neyla

Neyla begins reversing oaths pre-dawn — resonance frequency technique, two minutes per person initially. Freed people wake confused, crying, traumatized. Zariel shepherds them to evacuation. After anchor weakens, reversals accelerate to 30 seconds.

Over 200 people freed. Alarm sounds — sorcerers detected the weakening. Neyla keeps going past her limits. Zariel physically carries her out: "You saved two hundred people today. That's not failure. That's a miracle."

**Key Events:** 200+ oaths reversed, freed people's trauma described, alarm triggered, Neyla pushed past depletion, Zariel carries her out.

**Cliffhanger:** "I'll come back. I'll come back for all of you." The gap sealed. Hundreds still inside.
