# Chapter 9 Summary — MIYAKO'S DESCENT

**POV:** Miyako

Miyako descends into the temple basement — shadow-step past guards, through the labyrinth of repurposed corridors. She passes soul-siphon conduits carrying crimson consciousness. Finds the oath-anchor: massive dark crystal pillar pulsing with thousands of enslaved signatures.

Ten opponents — six sorcerers, four guards. She eliminates guards in ten seconds. Takes down four sorcerers. Drives her blade into the anchor's convergence point.

**Key Events:** Basement infiltration, soul-siphon conduits described, oath-anchor found, ten opponents engaged, blade driven into anchor's flaw.

**Cliffhanger:** She drives the blade in. The crystal cracks.
