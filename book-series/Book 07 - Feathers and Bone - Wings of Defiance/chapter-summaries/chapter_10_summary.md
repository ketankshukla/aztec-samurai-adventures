# Chapter 10 Summary — THE ANCHOR FALLS

**POV:** Miyako

The anchor cracks — shockwave of dark energy, every oath in the city weakens simultaneously. Above, enslaved people stumble, blink, begin to remember. Neyla's reversals accelerate from minutes to seconds. Cascading liberation.

Miyako is thrown by the blast. The two remaining sorcerers' combined attack accidentally hits the anchor instead. It shatters completely. Every active oath in Kanezawa breaks simultaneously. Thousands of people freed. Miyako retrieves her blade from the rubble. Guards coming. She begins to climb.

**Key Events:** Anchor shattered, city-wide oath liberation, thousands freed, Miyako injured by blasts, begins fighting her way up.

**Cliffhanger:** The anchor is destroyed. The city is free. Now she just has to get out alive.
