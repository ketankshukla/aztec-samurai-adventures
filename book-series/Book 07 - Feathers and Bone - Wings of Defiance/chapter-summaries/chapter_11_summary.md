# Chapter 11 Summary — SKYREN'S EVACUATION

**POV:** Skyren

Skyren coordinates aerial evacuation with twelve hawks — colored smoke marking safe corridors, dive-bombing pursuit to create confusion. Five thousand freed people stream through the eastern wall gap.

Dominion reinforcements approaching — Skyren flies into the reinforcement column, dropping every smoke charge and explosive. Buys twenty crucial minutes. The evacuation column crosses the river to safety in Coravel territory.

**Key Events:** Twelve-hawk aerial evacuation, smoke corridor guidance, 5,000 refugees extracted, reinforcement column disrupted, river crossing completed.

**Cliffhanger:** Most freed people are out. But Neyla is still inside. And Miyako is still in the basement. The clock is running.
