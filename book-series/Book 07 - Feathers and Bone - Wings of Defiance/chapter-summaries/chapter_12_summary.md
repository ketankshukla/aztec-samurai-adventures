# Chapter 12 Summary — NEYLA'S LIMIT

**POV:** Neyla

Neyla at absolute limit — 200+ people freed, reserves empty, body shaking, vision blurring. Zariel tries to pull her out. She can't leave the hundreds still enslaved. "I can't leave them."

Zariel carries her to the eastern gap: "You saved two hundred people today. That's not failure. That's a miracle." She looks back as the gap seals. "I'll come back for all of you."

**Key Events:** Neyla reaches depletion, 200+ freed total, Zariel carries her out, promise to return, gap sealed with hundreds still inside.

**Cliffhanger:** The healer sleeps. The turquoise light flickers — the first spark of reserves beginning to refill. She will come back.
