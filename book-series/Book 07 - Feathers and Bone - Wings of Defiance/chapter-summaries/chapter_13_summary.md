# Chapter 13 Summary — MIYAKO'S STAND

**POV:** Miyako

Miyako fights her way up from the basement — level by level, wound by wound. Shadow-step failing due to concussion. Raw skill only. Takes cuts across ribs, burn on leg, deep slash on shoulder. Each level harder.

The most beautiful combat sequence in the series — an old woman with a blade, moving like water, striking like lightning. Economy. Precision. Purpose. The shadow school at its most fundamental.

**Key Events:** Level-by-level ascent, accumulating wounds, shadow-step fails, raw skill combat, three levels of guards defeated.

**Cliffhanger:** Ground floor ahead. Twenty guards in formation between her and the temple doors. She raises her blade and charges.
