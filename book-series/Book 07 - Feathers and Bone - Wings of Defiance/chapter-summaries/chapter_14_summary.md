# Chapter 14 Summary — THE EXILE RETURNS

**POV:** Miyako

Miyako breaks the twenty-guard formation by entering the gaps between soldiers. Inside the formation, their density becomes weakness. She fights straight through — not elegant but efficient. Reaches the temple doors. Kicks them open. Sunlight.

Zariel waits with a horse. "MOVE!" They ride. Helisar's cavalry pursues. Skyren dive-bombs the lead horse. They reach the wall gap. Cross the river. Safety. Five thousand freed refugees streaming toward the rally point.

**Key Events:** Formation broken from inside, temple doors reached, horse escape, Skyren covers pursuit, river crossing to safety, Miyako sits on riverbank.

**Cliffhanger:** Miyako watches the freed people walk toward freedom. For the first time in decades, she feels not guilt but completion.
