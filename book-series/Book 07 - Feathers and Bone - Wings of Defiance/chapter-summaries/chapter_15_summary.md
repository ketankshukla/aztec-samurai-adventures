# Chapter 15 Summary — THE PURSUIT

**POV:** Skyren

Skyren covers the final evacuation — twelve hawks marking corridors, dive-bombing pursuit, dropping smoke charges on the Dominion reinforcement column. Buys twenty minutes. Evacuation column crosses the river. Dominion stops at the border.

From altitude, Skyren sees Miyako on the riverbank — motionless, peaceful. Skyren cries at two thousand feet where no one can see. The sky tells her the peace on Miyako's face is not completion. It's ending.

**Key Events:** Aerial evacuation coordination, reinforcement column disrupted, river crossing completed, Dominion pursuit halted, Skyren's aerial grief.

**Cliffhanger:** The peace on Miyako's face is not the peace of completion. It is the peace of ending.
