# Chapter 16 Summary — HELISAR'S LOSS

**POV:** Helisar (Villain)

Helisar surveys the ruins. Anchor destroyed, thousands freed. He doesn't understand why anyone would return pain to people he'd freed from it. Examines the shadow-school blade-work: "I haven't seen that in decades." Connects the infiltrator to Kanezawa's exile.

"I REMEMBER MY NAME" — four words on the wall. The crack in his certainty widens. If freed people remember identity, not just suffering, then his framework is incomplete. His prescription kills the patient instead of curing the disease.

**Key Events:** Ruins surveyed, shadow-school technique identified, exile connection made, "I REMEMBER MY NAME" revisited, certainty cracking deeper.

**Cliffhanger:** He leaves the words on the wall. The monster who is beginning to wonder if he is a monster.
