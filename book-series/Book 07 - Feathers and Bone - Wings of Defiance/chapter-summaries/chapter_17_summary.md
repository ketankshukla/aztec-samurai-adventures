# Chapter 17 Summary — THE REUNION

**POV:** Itzil

All three groups converge at Hidden Valley. Miyako arrives on a stretcher. Korvain reaches for her hand — two old warriors. The last time all ten heroes are together.

They eat together. Genuine laughter — Jagren tells a story about falling off a horse. Even Torvane smiles. Skyren laughs loudly. Miyako listens and smiles. A beautiful moment. The reader should savor it.

**Key Events:** Three groups reunite, Miyako on stretcher assessed, Kanezawa victory briefed, Crown at ~55%, team dinner with genuine laughter.

**Cliffhanger:** It's the last time they'll all be together. Tomorrow will be different.
