# Chapter 18 Summary — THE RACE FOR THE RELIC

**POV:** Kaelen

Intelligence: the Dominion needs the Sunheart relic at the original Sun-Blade temple. Valdremor's forces already moving south. It's a race — whoever gets the Sunheart first controls the endgame.

Itzil must go personally — temple wards require a Sun-Blade bearer. Full army mobilizes south. Miyako volunteers for forward scout team despite injuries. "Let me be useful. Please." The "please" breaks Itzil. She agrees.

**Key Events:** Sunheart relic intelligence, race established, army mobilizes south, roles assigned, Miyako joins forward scouts.

**Cliffhanger:** The race for the Sunheart begins. Valdremor's forces have a head start. The shadow master walks toward her last battle.
