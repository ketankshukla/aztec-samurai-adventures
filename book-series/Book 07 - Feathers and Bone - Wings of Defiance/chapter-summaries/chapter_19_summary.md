# Chapter 19 Summary — MIYAKO'S WOUNDS

**POV:** Neyla

Neyla examines Miyako — cracked ribs, progressive nerve damage, strained organs, weakened heart. "You need to stop. The march is killing you." Miyako: "You can't heal this. Don't waste your gift on me."

"Promise me you won't—" "I don't make promises I can't keep. You taught me that." She smiles warmly. Neyla watches her walk away — slowly, favoring her left side. The body is shutting down. Days, maybe weeks.

**Key Events:** Full medical assessment, terminal prognosis confirmed, Miyako refuses treatment priority, Neyla recognizes terminal pattern.

**Cliffhanger:** Miyako sits at the camp's edge, blade across her knees, looking south. Even at the end, she holds it. Because the blade is who she is.
