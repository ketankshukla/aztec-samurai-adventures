# Chapter 20 Summary — KORVAIN AND MIYAKO

**POV:** Korvain

Two old warriors at twilight. Light and shadow. Both running out of time. "You went back." "I had to." "Was it enough?" "It was what I could do."

"What does Itzil still need?" "To lose us. Both of us. And survive it." The weight settles. Their deaths will be the final lesson — removing the safety net so Itzil stands alone.

"It's a good night." "It is." Neither says: it might be one of the last.

**Key Events:** Korvain-Miyako twilight conversation, reflection on Itzil's development, acceptance that their deaths are necessary lessons, shared peace.

**Cliffhanger:** Two old warriors watching the stars. The Crown grows. The twilight is, despite everything, beautiful.
