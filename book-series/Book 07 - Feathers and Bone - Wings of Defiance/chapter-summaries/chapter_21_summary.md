# Chapter 21 Summary — THE ARMY MOBILIZES

**POV:** Itzil

Seventh day of the southern march. Army moves through high desert — Rainara extracts groundwater to sustain the force. Torvane manages logistics. Skyren detects Dominion force on parallel course, 40 miles southeast.

Kaelen and Miyako scout ahead. She's slower every day but her contribution exceeds her condition. Solkren works quietly — the armorer no one is watching. The race tightens.

**Key Events:** Desert march described, Rainara's water sustenance, Dominion parallel force detected, Miyako declining on forward scouts, race tightening.

**Cliffhanger:** The shadow master walks beside the scout, slower every day, heading toward the battle that will be her last.
