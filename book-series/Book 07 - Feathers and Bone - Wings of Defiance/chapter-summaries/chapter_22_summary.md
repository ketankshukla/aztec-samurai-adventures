# Chapter 22 Summary — MIYAKO'S LAST LESSON

**POV:** Kaelen

Miyako teaches Kaelen the shadow-fade — not invisibility but integration. Becoming indistinguishable from the environment. The shadow school's highest technique. Kaelen achieves it for three seconds.

She tells him about her past, her master. "I taught you to walk in shadows. Now teach yourself to walk in light." Kaelen: "That sounds like a goodbye." Miyako: "It sounds like a lesson. The last one I have." She doesn't meet his eyes.

**Key Events:** Shadow-fade technique taught, highest-level shadow school art, Miyako shares personal history, final lesson delivered, farewell disguised as instruction.

**Cliffhanger:** The last lesson. The final instruction. Tomorrow the march resumes. The battle comes. The cost is paid.
