# Chapter 23 Summary — THE AMBUSH

**POV:** Itzil

Dominion screening force on the southern road — 500 soldiers meant to delay the alliance. Itzil: "We punch through." Brief, fierce battle. Miyako fights in the forward line despite injuries — still devastating, pure economy.

A war-beast breaks through toward the medical corps. Miyako intercepts — sixty-three-year-old woman vs. creature five times her size. She drives it back with shadow-school techniques. Then collapses. Neyla rushes to her. Miyako grabs her wrist: "Stop. Save it for someone you can save."

**Key Events:** Screening force ambush, Itzil decides to punch through, Miyako fights in forward line, war-beast intercepted and driven back, Miyako collapses, terminal diagnosis confirmed.

**Cliffhanger:** "I CAN save you." "No. You can't. And that's all right." The cost is Miyako. The payment is coming due.
