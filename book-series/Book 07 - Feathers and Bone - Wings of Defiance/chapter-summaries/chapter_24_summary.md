# Chapter 24 Summary — FEATHERS AND BONE

**POV:** Itzil

Miyako is dying. The team gathers. She speaks to each:
- Kaelen: "Walk in shadows... now teach yourself to walk in light."
- Itzil: "You don't need to be perfect. You just need to be there."
- Jagren: "The boy who fought for glory became the man who fights for people."
- Neyla: "You healed a city. Don't forget to heal yourself."
- Skyren: "Keep flying, hawk girl. The sky is the only honest place left."

She looks at the sky. Closes her eyes. Breathing slows. Then stops.

**MIYAKO DIES.** The exile sensei. The woman who ran and spent a lifetime returning. She died surrounded by the people she loved, having saved the city she abandoned.

Skyren releases Cielovar with a feather from Miyako's cloak. The hawk circles once, cries, flies south. Feathers and bone — what remains when the spirit leaves.

The army marches at dawn. Miyako's ashes scattered on the wind. The team is now nine. Itzil leads. She doesn't look back. Miyako is with her now — in every step.

**Cliffhanger:** The feather flies south. The bone is ash. The spirit is everywhere. And the army marches on.
