Chapter 1 - WINGS OVER WAR

The world looked different from two thousand feet, and Skyren had learned to read it the way other people read books.

From altitude, the war was a map drawn in scars. Burned cities appeared as dark smudges against the green and brown landscape — the particular char-black of structures consumed by fire, surrounded by the ashen grey of fields that had been razed to deny the alliance food and shelter. Refugee columns appeared as thin, moving lines — streams of displaced people flowing along roads that connected nowhere to nowhere, their destinations uncertain and their origins destroyed.

Dominion patrol lines appeared as dotted patterns — the regular spacing of military units deployed along terrain features, each patrol a node in a network that covered the continent's central corridor like a net. Supply routes appeared as broader lines — the wagon-roads that connected the Dominion's logistics infrastructure, carrying food and weapons and the particular materials that an empire required to maintain the machinery of war.

Skyren mapped everything. The hawk rider's primary contribution to the alliance was information — the aerial perspective that no ground-based scout could provide, the god's-eye view that converted the war's chaos into patterns that could be analyzed and exploited. Every flight produced intelligence. Every intelligence product informed decisions. Every decision moved the alliance one step closer to the next objective.

Cielovar flew beneath her with the effortless power of a golden hawk at the peak of his capability. The bird had grown during the war — not physically but in the intangible quality that distinguished a trained animal from a partner. Cielovar anticipated her commands before she gave them. A shift in her weight produced a banking turn. A pressure from her knees produced a dive. The bond between rider and hawk had evolved from the trained response of a conditioned animal to something deeper — an almost telepathic connection that operated at the level of instinct rather than instruction.

The hawk had scars. A line across his left wing — the mark of a hawk-killer bolt that had grazed him during the Thalendor flight, the crystal tip cutting feather and skin without severing the flight-critical structures beneath. A notch in his right talon — the result of a combat engagement with a Dominion war-raptor, the talon chipped during the strike that had driven the larger bird away. The scars were the hawk's history — the accumulated record of a career of risk that paralleled his rider's own.

Skyren carried messages between the allied positions. The water-communication network that Rainara had established was effective for simple transmissions, but complex intelligence — detailed maps, tactical analyses, the nuanced assessments that informed strategic decisions — required physical delivery. Skyren was the courier. The thread that connected the scattered pieces of an alliance that had been broken and was slowly being stitched back together.

Each flight was a gauntlet. The Dominion had deployed anti-air defenses along every major route — hawk-killer crossbow batteries positioned on ridgelines, wind-sorcery arrays that created turbulence zones designed to destabilize aerial transit, and trained raptors that patrolled the airspace above key installations. Skyren had been hit twice since the scattering — once by a crossbow bolt that had embedded in her saddle six inches from her thigh, once by a wind-sorcery blast that had tumbled Cielovar into a spin that required three hundred feet of altitude to recover from.

She flew anyway. Because flying was what she did and the alliance needed what she did and the alternative — staying on the ground, being grounded, existing in the mud and blood that she had described to Miyako — was unacceptable.

The current flight was a reconnaissance sweep — a circuit of the central corridor that would take her over the Dominion's main patrol routes and the territory between Hidden Valley and the southern territories. The sweep was routine — the kind of intelligence-gathering mission that she had flown dozens of times, the risk managed through altitude, speed, and the instinctive route-selection that years of flying had embedded in her decision-making.

She flew south. The terrain below changed — the forested mountains of the northern territories giving way to the rolling hills of the central corridor, the hills giving way to the coastal lowlands that bordered the southern provinces. The landscape was beautiful from altitude — the particular beauty that existed when scale converted the details of devastation into abstract patterns, when the burned cities and refugee columns and patrol lines became shapes on a canvas rather than evidence of suffering.

Skyren didn't let the beauty fool her. The shapes were people. The patterns were death. The abstract was concrete, and the concrete was the war that she was helping to fight from the only position that made sense to her — above it.

She spotted the column at midday. South-southeast, approximately forty miles from Hidden Valley. A massive formation — not military, not a patrol, not a supply convoy. People. Thousands of people walking in formation along the southern road. The formation was precise — rows and columns, the spacing uniform, the pace identical. No variation. No deviation. No individuality.

Ash-oath slaves. The blank-eyed people that the Dominion's machine produced — consciousness harvested, identities erased, bodies converted into components of a system that served the Great Gate's energy requirements. Thousands of them, walking in perfect order toward a destination that Skyren could identify by checking the map she carried in her flight pouch.

She checked. The destination was a city. A beautiful city — terraced gardens visible from altitude, wooden temples with curved roofs, flowing canals that caught the sunlight and threw it back in silver ribbons. The city's name was on the map.

Kanezawa.

Miyako's home.

Skyren's stomach dropped — not from altitude but from the particular vertigo that accompanied the collision of intelligence with emotion. Helisar was expanding his ash-oath operation to Kanezawa. The people who lived in that beautiful city — the people who had known Miyako, who had trained at her school, who had been her neighbors and friends and colleagues — were about to be processed. Enslaved. Erased.

She banked Cielovar north. The hawk responded instantly — the turn smooth, the acceleration immediate, the bird understanding through the bond that the rider's urgency was real and the mission had changed.

The intelligence had to reach the alliance. Miyako had to know. Itzil had to decide.

Skyren flew north — fast, direct, the gauntlet of anti-air defenses navigated with the particular recklessness that existed when the message was more important than the messenger's safety. She dodged a hawk-killer battery by diving below the bolt's tracking altitude. She outran a wind-sorcery zone by accelerating through it before the turbulence could fully develop. She evaded a patrol of trained raptors by climbing above their operational ceiling — the thin, cold air that golden hawks could tolerate and war-raptors couldn't.

She reached Hidden Valley by evening. The landing was controlled this time — not the crash of the Thalendor arrival but the precise, efficient descent of a rider who had news that couldn't wait and a hawk who understood that precision was required.

She found Itzil at the command position. The commander looked up from the tactical maps that she had been studying — the pale golden light of the Sun-Blade at her hip illuminating the plans and intelligence documents that covered the stone table.

"Skyren. Report."

"Massive ash-oath column moving south. Thousands of slaves. Destination: Kanezawa." She paused. The next words required a breath — not for oxygen but for the particular effort of delivering information that she knew would detonate. "Miyako's home city. Helisar is expanding his operation there."

Itzil's face didn't change. The command mask held — the controlled expression that processed catastrophe without displaying it. But her eyes shifted — the particular movement that indicated the commander's mind was already calculating implications, options, and the specific person who needed to hear this intelligence before anyone else.

"Find Miyako," Itzil said. "Tell her."

Skyren found Miyako at the camp's edge — the shadow master sitting in the evening light, her grey hair catching the sunset, her posture carrying the particular stillness that characterized a person whose mind was active while their body was motionless.

Skyren told her. The words were delivered with the efficient directness that characterized everything Skyren communicated — no softening, no preamble, the intelligence presented as data because data was what Miyako needed, not comfort.

Miyako listened. Her face didn't change. Her posture didn't shift. The stillness deepened — becoming not calm but compression, the particular quality that existed when everything a person felt was being pressed into a space too small to contain it.

She looked south. Toward Kanezawa. Toward the city she had abandoned decades ago. Toward the people she had left behind.

Her jaw set. The compression resolved — not into explosion but into something harder. Resolution. The absolute, structural certainty that preceded irreversible action.

"How far?" she asked.

Skyren could have lied. Could have exaggerated the distance, the difficulty, the impossibility. She didn't.

"Two days' march from Neyla's position in Coravel."

Miyako nodded. The nod was small. Final. The nod of a person who had just made the last decision of their life and was at peace with it.

She stood. She walked toward the command position.

Skyren watched her go. The hawk rider — young, brash, the person who lived for the sky — watched the shadow master walk toward the conversation that would set everything in motion, and she felt something that altitude couldn't provide and speed couldn't escape.

The feeling was grief. Preemptive. The grief of a person who could see the whole picture from above and who understood, with the clarity that altitude provided, that the woman walking toward the command tent was walking toward something she wouldn't walk back from.

The sky was the only honest place. And the sky was telling Skyren that the shadow master's story was approaching its end.
