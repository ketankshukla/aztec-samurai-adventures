Chapter 3 - SKYREN'S MISSION

The flight south took two days, and on the first night Skyren learned something about Miyako that changed how she understood the war.

They launched from Hidden Valley at dawn — Cielovar carrying double weight, the golden hawk's powerful wings compensating for the additional passenger with the characteristic stubbornness of a bird that had opinions about load limits but obeyed his rider's judgment regardless. Miyako sat behind Skyren on the hawk's broad back — the shadow master's weight negligible, her body lean and light from decades of discipline that had stripped everything unnecessary from her physical frame.

The flight path curved south — avoiding the Dominion's central patrol corridor, following the mountain ridgelines that provided concealment from ground observation and thermal updrafts that reduced Cielovar's energy expenditure. Skyren navigated by instinct and memory — the terrain that she had mapped during months of reconnaissance flights now stored in her consciousness as a three-dimensional model that she could reference as naturally as breathing.

Miyako was quiet. The shadow master sat behind Skyren with the particular stillness that characterized everything about her — the absence of unnecessary movement, the conservation of energy, the discipline that converted rest into preparation. She didn't grip the saddle. She didn't tense during banking turns. She moved with the hawk as though she had been flying her entire life — the body's automatic adjustment to an unfamiliar medium, the martial artist's instinct to flow with forces rather than resist them.

They camped on a cliff edge the first night — a narrow ledge on a mountain face that provided shelter from wind and concealment from observation. Cielovar perched above them on a rock outcropping, the golden hawk's amber eyes scanning the valley below with the territorial intensity that never fully switched off.

The fire was small — Kaelen's technique, the smokeless combustion that Skyren had learned from the scout and now employed automatically. The warmth was minimal but sufficient. The cliff edge was cold — the altitude producing the particular chill that existed when the sun's warmth was gone and the rock's heat had radiated into the night.

"Why do you fly?" Miyako asked.

The question was unexpected — not because it was personal but because Miyako didn't typically initiate conversation. The shadow master's default mode was silence — the particular, professional silence of a person who communicated through action rather than words and who considered speech a tool to be deployed strategically rather than habitually.

Skyren answered without thinking — the hawk rider's instinctive honesty, the unfiltered response that existed when a question was genuine and the answer was simple.

"Because up there, everything makes sense. You can see the whole picture. Down here, it's just mud and blood."

Miyako considered this. The consideration was visible — a slight tilt of her head, the particular angle that indicated active processing rather than passive reception.

"The picture looks different from up close," she said. "Don't forget to land."

"What does that mean?"

"It means the view from above is honest but incomplete. You can see the patterns — the troop movements, the supply lines, the terrain features. But you can't see the people. The faces. The individual lives that the patterns contain. The view from above shows you where the war is. The view from the ground shows you what the war costs."

Skyren was quiet. The observation was accurate — uncomfortably so. The hawk rider's aerial perspective was her strength and her limitation simultaneously. She saw everything and felt nothing — the altitude converting suffering into shapes, the distance converting people into patterns.

"I see them," Skyren said. "From up there. The refugee columns. The burned cities. I see them."

"You see the columns. You don't see the child in the column who's carrying a blanket and asking a healer if she's going to die."

The reference was specific — Neyla's story from the retreat to Coravel, the girl with the blanket and the wide eyes. Miyako had heard the story. She was using it now — not as a criticism but as a calibration, adjusting Skyren's perspective the way a teacher adjusted a student's technique.

"I'm not saying stop flying," Miyako continued. "The sky is where you're needed. But when you land — and you must land — see the faces. Remember that every pattern is made of people. Every shape on your map is someone's life."

Skyren looked at the fire. The flames were small — contained, efficient, producing light and warmth without waste. Like Miyako. Everything about the shadow master was contained, efficient, purposeful.

"You sound like you're giving a final lecture," Skyren said. The observation was made lightly — the hawk rider's characteristic humor, the deflection that she employed when conversations approached depths that made her uncomfortable.

Miyako didn't laugh. She didn't deny it. She looked at the fire with the particular attention of a person studying something that they wanted to remember.

"Maybe I am," she said.

They shared something that night — the unexpected connection that existed between two people who were different in every measurable way but who recognized in each other the particular quality that defined them both. Skyren was young, brash, lived for the sky. Miyako was old, measured, lived for duty. But they shared the experience of being the one who survived when others didn't — the particular, isolating knowledge that existed when a person's survival depended on a skill that removed them from the situations that killed the people around them.

Skyren survived by being above the battle. Miyako survived by being invisible within it. Both knew the guilt that accompanied survival — the question that neither asked aloud: why me? Why did I live when others didn't?

The answer, for both of them, was purpose. Skyren flew because the alliance needed her to fly. Miyako fought because the alliance needed her to fight. The purpose justified the survival. The survival served the purpose. The circle was complete — and completely insufficient, because the guilt remained regardless of how many logical justifications were stacked on top of it.

They reached Neyla's group the next afternoon. The Coravel camp was positioned on the coast — a temporary settlement near the port town of Millhaven where the non-combatant refugees from the scattering had been sheltered. Zariel had established the camp with the diplomatic efficiency that characterized everything he did — the shelters organized, the supply lines established, the relationship with Coravel's government managed with the particular grace that converted hosts into allies.

Miyako dismounted from Cielovar. She stood on the ground — the solid, familiar, mud-and-blood ground that Skyren described with such distaste — and looked south. Toward Kanezawa. Toward the city that was two days' march away and a lifetime of guilt behind.

She embraced Zariel. The diplomat received the embrace with the surprised warmth of a man who was not accustomed to physical affection from the shadow master and who understood, from the quality of the embrace, that something significant was happening.

She embraced Neyla. The healer held on — the particular grip of a medical professional who could feel, through touch, the state of another person's body. Neyla's expression shifted during the embrace — the micro-change that indicated she had detected something in Miyako's physical condition that concerned her.

Then Miyako looked south. Her jaw set. The compression that had defined her since the news about Kanezawa resolved into the final, absolute form that preceded action.

"How far?" she asked.

"Two days' march," Zariel said.

"Then we march."

The words were simple. The resolve behind them was not. The shadow master who had run from her city decades ago was going back — not because the war required it, not because the alliance ordered it, but because the debt that she owed the people she had abandoned could only be paid in person.

The march south began the next morning. Three people — Miyako, Neyla, Zariel — plus a small team of volunteers from the Coravel escort. Walking toward a city that was beautiful and enslaved and waiting for the return of the woman who had left it to its fate.

Skyren watched them go from altitude. Cielovar circled above the marching column — the golden hawk's amber eyes tracking the three figures at the column's head, the hawk rider's aerial perspective providing the whole picture that Miyako had told her was honest but incomplete.

From up here, the column was a line. A pattern. A shape on a map.

From down there, the column was Miyako walking toward her past. Neyla walking toward her limit. Zariel walking toward the most dangerous diplomatic situation of his career.

From down there, the column was people. Faces. Lives.

Skyren remembered. She would always remember. The picture looked different from up close.

Don't forget to land.
