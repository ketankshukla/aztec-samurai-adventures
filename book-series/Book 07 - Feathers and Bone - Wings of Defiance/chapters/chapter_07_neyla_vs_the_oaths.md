Chapter 7 - NEYLA VS. THE OATHS

The first oath broke at 5:17 AM, and the man who emerged from it didn't know his name for three seconds.

Neyla knelt beside him in the processing center's outer corridor — the hallway that connected the guest quarters to the main temple hall, the transitional space where new arrivals waited before being led to the processing lines. The corridor was empty at this hour — the pre-dawn gap between the night shift's end and the day shift's beginning, the window that Zariel had identified as the operation's optimal start time.

The man was a guard. Not a Dominion soldier — a Kanezawa citizen who had been ash-oathed and reassigned to security duty, his martial skills repurposed from protecting the city to protecting the mechanism that enslaved it. He had been standing at a corridor junction, his eyes carrying the glazed absence that the oath produced, his body performing the patrol routine that his binding dictated.

Neyla had approached him with the confidence of a person who belonged — the guest quarter resident returning from the latrine, the unremarkable movement that guards were programmed to ignore. She placed her hand on his arm. The turquoise light flowed — calibrated, precise, matching the ash-oath's resonance frequency with the accuracy that practice had refined.

The sigil on his chest cracked. The crimson mark fractured — the dark energy dispersing, the binding dissolving, the consciousness returning.

Three seconds of blankness. Then his eyes cleared. The awareness returned — the spark of individual identity reigniting like a flame from an ember. He blinked. He looked at his hands. He looked at the corridor. He looked at Neyla.

"Where—" His voice was rough. Unused. The vocal cords recovering from weeks of suppression.

"You're free," Neyla whispered. "Follow me. Quietly."

He followed. The first of many — the initial crack in the dam that Neyla would widen throughout the morning.

She worked through the outer corridors. Patient. Methodical. Each oath-bearer approached individually — the turquoise light applied, the resonance matched, the sigil cracked. Each freed person was directed to Zariel, who shepherded them to the evacuation staging point that the bribed guard had opened on the eastern wall.

Ten people. The process was faster than it had been in Coravel — Neyla's technique improving with each application, the resonance matching becoming instinctive rather than calculated. Each reversal took approximately two minutes. The energy cost was significant but manageable — the breathing technique maintaining her reserves, the bridge between exhaustion and capability holding steady.

Twenty people. The freed individuals emerged from their oaths with varying degrees of awareness. Some were lucid within seconds — their consciousness resilient, the oath's suppression shallow enough that the identity reasserted quickly. Others required minutes — the deeper bindings producing a longer recovery period, the consciousness returning in stages rather than all at once.

All of them remembered. That was the devastating part. The ash-oath suppressed consciousness but didn't erase experience. The people who woke from the binding remembered everything that had happened while they were enslaved — every task performed, every order followed, the particular horror of being aware at some level that they were not themselves while being unable to do anything about it.

The psychological damage was immense. Freed people cried. Trembled. Some screamed — the sound suppressed immediately by Zariel, who was managing the emotional fallout with the particular skill that his diplomatic training provided. He was gentle. He was firm. He moved people toward the evacuation point with the authority of a person who understood that shock required direction rather than sympathy.

Thirty people. Neyla was sweating — the physical cost of sustained magical output, the body producing the thermoregulatory response that accompanied exertion. Her turquoise light was dimming — the output decreasing as her reserves depleted, the light that had been bright at the first reversal now muted, the energy that powered it draining.

She breathed. Four counts in. Seven counts hold. Eight counts out. Miyako's lesson, transmitted through Neyla's practice, sustaining her when her body's resources were insufficient. The bridge held. The cup refilled. Not fully — never fully — but enough.

She kept going. Forty people. Fifty. Each one a name restored. Each one a consciousness recovered. Each one a human being who existed again as a person rather than a component.

The processing center's main hall was her next target. The hall contained the processing lines — the benches where new arrivals sat and waited for the sorcerers who would press the ash-oath sigils into their chests. At this hour, the hall held approximately fifty people who had been admitted the previous day and were scheduled for morning processing.

Neyla entered the hall. The turquoise light flowed — not one at a time now but in a sweep, the resonance frequency broadcast across the room like a tuning fork struck in a concert hall. The technique was new — an extension of the individual reversal, scaled to affect multiple targets simultaneously. The energy cost was enormous — each person in the sweep requiring the same output that an individual reversal demanded, the total cost multiplied by the number of targets.

The oaths didn't break. Not with a sweep — the technique wasn't powerful enough for clean reversal at scale. But the oaths weakened. The crimson sigils on fifty chests flickered — the bindings destabilized, the consciousness partially freed, the people in the processing lines blinking and stirring and beginning to remember.

Neyla moved through the hall. Individual reversals on the weakened oaths — faster now, the destabilized bindings requiring less energy to break completely. Two minutes per person became thirty seconds. The math improved. The output increased.

Sixty people freed. Seventy. Eighty. The hall was emptying — the processing line subjects standing, confused, directed by Zariel's volunteers toward the evacuation route.

An alarm sounded. The sound was sharp — the crystal-based alert system that Helisar's security apparatus used, the harmonic that indicated a breach in the operation's normal parameters. The weakened oaths had been detected — the sorcerers who maintained the binding network had felt the disturbance, the collective weakening that Neyla's sweep had produced registering on their monitoring systems.

Guards mobilized. The security response that the alarm triggered — Dominion soldiers and oathed Kanezawa guards converging on the processing center, the systematic response to a threat that the operation's designers had anticipated and planned for.

Neyla had minutes. Maybe less. The guards would find her. The sorcerers would locate the source of the disturbance. The window that had allowed her to work undetected was closing.

She kept going. Ninety people. One hundred. The turquoise light was guttering — the reserves approaching empty, the bridge between exhaustion and capability straining under the weight of continuous output. Her hands were shaking. Her vision was blurring — the particular visual distortion that accompanied magical depletion, the body's systems redirecting resources from non-essential functions to maintain the core processes that kept her alive.

One hundred and ten. One hundred and twenty. Each person freed was a vote against the machine. Each consciousness restored was a brick removed from the Gate's foundation. Each name remembered was a refusal — the stubborn, beautiful, human refusal to be erased.

The guards reached the processing center's entrance. Neyla could hear them — the coordinated footsteps, the shouted orders, the particular urgency that existed when a security apparatus detected a threat it hadn't anticipated.

She freed one more. And another. And another. Each one costing more than the last — the reserves depleting below the threshold that sustained function, the body's systems beginning to fail in the particular sequence that magical exhaustion produced. Her turquoise light was barely visible — a flicker, a ghost, the last embers of a fire that had been burning for hours.

Zariel appeared at her side. The diplomat's composure was intact but his urgency was visible — the particular expression that characterized a person whose plan was succeeding and whose timeline was collapsing simultaneously.

"We have to go. The reinforcements are coming."

Neyla looked at the hall. Still people. Still enslaved. Hundreds more — in the temple, in the streets, in the workshops and homes and markets of a city that had been consumed by the machine. She couldn't save them all. The realization was crushing — the particular, devastating weight of knowing that the effort had been enormous and the result had been insufficient.

She freed one more. The turquoise light flickered — barely there, the last breath of a power that had been pushed past every limit.

Zariel physically carried her. His arms around her waist — the diplomat's strength surprising, the body beneath the refined exterior capable of the physical effort that the situation demanded. He lifted her from the hall and moved her toward the evacuation route.

She cried. The tears were not weakness — they were the overflow of a person whose emotional capacity had been exceeded by the gap between what she had done and what remained undone. She had freed over two hundred people. Two hundred names restored. Two hundred consciousnesses recovered. And hundreds more remained.

"I can't leave them," she said. "I can't—"

"You saved two hundred people today," Zariel said. His voice was steady — the diplomatic delivery that managed emotions by acknowledging them rather than dismissing them. "That's not failure. That's a miracle."

They moved through the evacuation route — the eastern wall gap that Zariel's bribed guard had opened. Outside, the freed refugees were being organized — Zariel's volunteers directing the confused, frightened, newly-conscious people toward the rally point where Skyren's hawk riders would coordinate the extraction.

Neyla looked back. The city was still full of enslaved people she couldn't reach. The processing center was still operational. The machine was still running.

"I'll come back," she whispered. "I'll come back for all of you."

The promise joined the collection of promises she had made — to the girl with the blanket, to the woman named Sera, to every person she had healed and every person she hadn't. The promises were not guarantees. They were commitments — the expression of a will that refused to accept that the current limitation was permanent.

The alarm continued. The guards searched. The operation's clock was running.

And somewhere in the temple's basement, the shadow master was descending toward the anchor that would change everything.
