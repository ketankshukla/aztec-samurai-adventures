Chapter 11 - SKYREN'S EVACUATION

Skyren saw the anchor fall from two thousand feet, and the sky told her everything she needed to know.

The detonation was visible from altitude — a pulse of crimson light that erupted from the temple's foundation and propagated outward through Kanezawa's streets in a shockwave that was more magical than physical. The pulse passed through buildings, through walls, through people — and everywhere it passed, the ash-oaths broke. Skyren could see the effect: the mechanical precision of the city's population stuttering, faltering, dissolving into the beautiful chaos of thousands of people suddenly remembering who they were.

"The anchor's down," she said to Cielovar. The hawk didn't understand the words, but the urgency in her voice produced the response she needed — the golden bird banking toward the city with the aggressive precision of a predator moving to engagement range.

Skyren had recruited twelve hawk riders from Pyrrath's scattered cavalry — the aerial corps that had been dispersed during the scattering and that she had been reassembling during her reconnaissance flights. Twelve hawks carrying ropes, harnesses, smoke charges, and the particular determination of riders who had been grounded for weeks and were eager to fly with purpose.

The evacuation plan was Zariel's design, executed from altitude by Skyren's coordination. The freed people would stream through the eastern wall gap — the breach that Zariel's bribed guard had opened. The hawk riders would mark safe corridors from above, using colored smoke to indicate paths that were clear of Dominion pursuit. The rally point was three miles east of the city — a river crossing that marked the boundary of defensible terrain.

Skyren directed the operation from above. "Blue smoke — eastern boulevard is clear. Red smoke — northern approach is blocked, guards converging. Green smoke — rally point confirmed, medical team in position."

The freed people streamed out. Hundreds — then thousands as the anchor's destruction completed the liberation that Neyla's individual reversals had begun. The streets of Kanezawa were chaos — the particular, human chaos of a population whose consciousness had been restored and whose first instinct was to flee the place where the consciousness had been taken.

Helisar's guards pursued. The Dominion soldiers who had been maintaining security in the city — a garrison of approximately three hundred — mobilized to intercept the evacuation. Their orders were unclear — Helisar's command structure, designed for managing a compliant population, was not equipped for the sudden conversion of that population from obedient subjects to panicked fugitives.

Skyren and her riders dove. Not attacking — creating confusion. The hawks swooped over the pursuit columns at treetop height, the massive birds producing the primal fear response that ground-based humans experienced when large predators passed overhead at speed. The pursuit scattered — soldiers ducking, breaking formation, the instinctive reaction to aerial threat disrupting the coordinated response that catching fleeing civilians required.

Skyren dropped smoke charges on the pursuit's approach routes. The charges produced dense, colored clouds that obscured vision and confused navigation — the particular disorientation that existed when soldiers couldn't see the people they were chasing or the terrain they were crossing.

The confusion bought time. The freed people — guided by Zariel's volunteers on the ground and Skyren's smoke markers from above — flowed toward the eastern gap in a stream that was disorganized but directed. The evacuation was not orderly. It was not controlled. It was the particular, messy, desperate movement of thousands of people who had been enslaved and were now free and were running because running was the first thing that freedom allowed.

Skyren spotted Dominion reinforcements approaching from the east. A column — cavalry and infantry, the rapid-response force that the Dominion maintained in every occupied territory. They were an hour away. Maybe less if they increased pace.

"Get everyone out NOW," she signaled to Zariel. "Reinforcements coming."

The evacuation accelerated. The trickle became a flood — the freed population abandoning any pretense of order and simply running, the human response to imminent danger that overrode every other consideration. The eastern gap — a thirty-foot breach in the city wall — became a bottleneck. People jammed against each other. The panic that large crowds produced in confined spaces began to build.

Zariel managed the bottleneck. The diplomat stood at the gap — physically present, his voice carrying the authority that his training provided, the particular calm that converted panic into direction. He didn't shout. He spoke — firmly, specifically, directing individual people rather than addressing the crowd. "You — through the gap, turn right, follow the blue smoke. You — carry the child, move quickly. You — help the woman with the injured leg."

The specifics worked. The crowd that had been a mass converted into individuals — people who had been given a task and were performing it, the panic replaced by purpose. The bottleneck cleared. The flow resumed.

Most of the freed people were out. The eastern districts were largely empty — the population that had been processing through the gap now streaming toward the rally point three miles east. But the western and central districts still held people — the freed citizens who hadn't reached the eastern gap, who were trapped behind Dominion guard lines, who were hiding in buildings or wandering the streets in the confusion of restored consciousness.

Skyren couldn't save them all. The reinforcements were closing. The guard pursuit was reorganizing. The window that the anchor's destruction had opened was closing with the particular inevitability of opportunity that existed only for a finite time.

She made the assessment from altitude — the hawk rider's perspective, the whole picture that showed the saved and the unsaved and the distance between them. Hundreds of people were still in the city. Hundreds who would be recaptured, re-oathed, re-enslaved when the Dominion's control was restored.

The assessment was devastating. The view from above — honest, complete, merciless — showed Skyren exactly how many people they were leaving behind.

But the view also showed her the thousands who were free. The stream of liberated humanity flowing toward the rally point — three, four, five thousand people who had been enslaved that morning and were now running toward freedom in the afternoon sun. Each one a consciousness restored. Each one a name remembered.

"That's everyone we can get," she transmitted. "Closing the gap. Moving to rally point cover."

The eastern gap was sealed — Zariel's volunteers collapsing the temporary breach, the wall restored to its defensive configuration. The Dominion guards who had been pursuing the evacuation reached the sealed wall and found themselves facing stone rather than fleeing civilians.

Skyren covered the final approach to the rally point. Her riders flew patterns above the evacuation column — the aerial screen that detected threats and diverted them, the hawks' presence deterring the cavalry pursuit that the Dominion's reinforcement column might attempt.

The column reached the river crossing. The rally point — established by Zariel's advance team, equipped with medical supplies and the Coravel escort that had accompanied the mission — received the freed population with the organized efficiency that the diplomat's planning provided.

Five thousand people. Approximately five thousand freed citizens of Kanezawa, crossing the river to safety, their consciousness restored, their identities intact, their futures uncertain but existent.

But Neyla was still inside. Working past her limits, freeing the last people she could reach. And Miyako was still in the basement. Fighting her way up from the destroyed anchor through a building full of guards.

The clock was running. The reinforcements were forty minutes out. The operation's window was closing.

Skyren circled above the city. From altitude, Kanezawa was beautiful — the terraced gardens, the curved temple roofs, the silver canals. And from altitude, the chaos was visible — the freed population streaming east, the guards converging, the smoke from the charges dissipating into the afternoon air.

The picture looked different from up close. Miyako had told her that. The faces. The individual lives. The cost.

Skyren descended. Lower than operational protocol recommended. Low enough to see the faces of the people running through the streets — the fear, the confusion, the particular, devastating hope that existed when a person who had been enslaved discovered that freedom was possible and that the path to it was through a gap in a wall and a river crossing and the rest of their life.

She saw the faces. She would remember them.

Don't forget to land.
