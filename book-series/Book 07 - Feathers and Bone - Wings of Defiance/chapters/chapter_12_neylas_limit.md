Chapter 12 - NEYLA'S LIMIT

Neyla was pouring her life into the healings and her life was running out.

The anchor's destruction had changed everything — the weakened oaths shattering in cascades, the resonance technique amplified by the binding network's collapse. She had freed over two hundred people in the hours since the operation began. Two hundred names restored. Two hundred consciousnesses recovered. Two hundred human beings who existed again as people rather than components.

And it was not enough.

The city still held hundreds of enslaved citizens — the people in the western and central districts who hadn't reached the eastern evacuation route, who were trapped behind Dominion guard lines, who were wandering the streets in the confusion of restored awareness without knowing where to go. Each one was a consciousness that Neyla could restore if she could reach them. Each one was a person she was leaving behind.

She was in the temple's outer courtyard — the space between the processing center and the eastern wall gap, the transitional area where freed people gathered before being directed toward the evacuation route. The courtyard held approximately thirty people who hadn't yet been moved — a mix of newly freed citizens and people whose oaths had been weakened but not broken by the anchor's destruction.

Neyla worked. The turquoise light flowed — diminished, flickering, the reserves that had been depleted by hours of continuous output now approaching the threshold below which the body's systems began to fail. Each reversal cost more than the last — the energy requirements unchanged while the available energy decreased, the mathematics of depletion producing an exponential curve that was approaching vertical.

Her hands shook. The tremor was visible — not the fine, controlled movement that accompanied precision work but the gross, uncontrolled shaking that accompanied systemic failure. Her body was consuming itself — the magical depletion forcing the biological systems to compensate, the muscles and organs providing the energy that the magical reserves could no longer supply.

Her vision blurred. The particular visual distortion that accompanied extreme magical depletion — the body redirecting resources from the visual cortex to maintain core functions, the eyes losing acuity as the brain prioritized survival over perception.

She freed one more. A man — middle-aged, his ash-oath weakened by the anchor's destruction. The turquoise light touched him and the sigil cracked and dissolved and his eyes cleared and he looked at Neyla with the bewildered gratitude of a person who had been drowning and had been pulled to the surface by a hand he didn't know.

"Thank you," he said. The words were hoarse — the voice recovering from weeks of suppression.

"Go east," Neyla said. "Follow the blue smoke. The river crossing. Safety."

He went. Another person saved. Another name restored.

She reached for the next. A woman — young, her oath weakened but holding. Neyla's hands touched her arm. The turquoise light flickered — barely there, the last embers of a fire that had been burning for hours and was approaching the final moments of its fuel.

The light went out. The turquoise glow — the visible manifestation of Neyla's healing magic, the energy that she had been channeling since before dawn — ceased. Her reserves were empty. Not depleted — empty. The particular, absolute zero that existed when every available unit of magical energy had been consumed and the body had nothing left to give.

Neyla's legs buckled. The collapse was not dramatic — not the theatrical fall of a person making a statement but the quiet, undramatic failure of a body whose systems had reached their limit. She went to her knees. Then to her hands. The stone courtyard was cold against her palms.

Zariel was there. The diplomat appeared beside her with the particular urgency that existed when a colleague was failing and the situation required immediate intervention. His hands found her shoulders — supporting, steadying, the physical contact that prevented the complete collapse that Neyla's body was attempting.

"We have to go," he said. "The reinforcements are coming."

"I can't leave them." The words were automatic — the response that existed at the intersection of duty and depletion, the healer's instinct refusing to accept what the healer's body had already demonstrated. "I can't—"

"You saved two hundred people today. That's not failure. That's a miracle."

The words penetrated. Not immediately — the cognitive processing that comprehension required was diminished by the depletion that was affecting every system. But the words reached her. Two hundred. The number that quantified her morning's work. Two hundred people who had names because of what she had done.

And hundreds more who didn't. The number that quantified her morning's failure. Hundreds of people who were still enslaved because her body couldn't do what her will demanded.

Zariel lifted her. The diplomat's arms — stronger than his refined appearance suggested — carried her toward the eastern gap. She was too weak to resist. Too depleted to walk. The body that had been channeling healing magic since before dawn was now a passenger in its own evacuation.

She cried. The tears were the overflow of a person whose emotional capacity had been exceeded by the distance between achievement and need. She had done more than any single person could reasonably be expected to do. She had pushed past every limit that her body imposed and several that her mind had constructed. She had freed two hundred people in a single morning.

And it wasn't enough. Because "enough" meant everyone. And everyone was a number that exceeded one person's capability regardless of how far that person pushed.

The eastern gap was closing. Zariel's volunteers were preparing to seal the breach — the evacuation's final phase, the closure that would protect the freed population from pursuit while leaving the remaining enslaved citizens inside the walls.

Neyla looked back. Through the gap — through the narrowing aperture that was about to seal — she could see the city. The streets. The buildings. The people who were still inside. The enslaved whose oaths she hadn't reached. The freed whose confusion she hadn't managed. The lives that existed on the other side of a wall that was about to close.

"I'll come back," she whispered. The promise was quiet — addressed to the city, to the people, to the gap that was closing between her and the obligation that she couldn't fulfill. "I'll come back for all of you."

The gap sealed. The wall closed. The city was on one side. Neyla was on the other.

Outside, the freed refugees were being organized for the march to the rally point. Five thousand people — confused, frightened, many of them physically weak from weeks of enslavement. They needed medical attention. They needed food. They needed the particular care that restored not just consciousness but the capacity to use it.

Neyla couldn't provide that care. Not now. Not with empty reserves and a body that was consuming itself. She was carried to the medical station — the portable healing setup that the Coravel escort maintained — and placed on a cot beside the patients she should have been treating.

She lay on the cot. The sky above was blue — the particular blue that autumn produced, the deep, clear color that existed when the atmosphere was cool and dry and the light was clean. She looked at the sky and thought about the people she had saved and the people she hadn't and the distance between the two numbers that represented, in the simplest possible terms, the gap between what a healer could do and what a healer needed to do.

Two hundred saved. The miracle.

Hundreds remaining. The failure.

The gap was the war. The gap was the ash-oath crisis. The gap was the fundamental, devastating arithmetic of a conflict where the enemy's capacity for destruction exceeded the alliance's capacity for restoration.

But the gap was narrowing. Neyla's technique was improving. The resonance frequency could be taught. Other healers could learn it. The individual capability that was insufficient today could become the collective capability that was sufficient tomorrow.

The method worked. Methods that worked could be scaled. Scaled methods could close the gap.

She closed her eyes. The exhaustion was absolute — the body demanding unconsciousness the way a drowning person demanded air. She surrendered to it. The healer who had spent months refusing to rest finally rested — not by choice but by necessity, the body overriding the will that had been pushing it past every limit.

She slept. And in her sleep, the turquoise light flickered — faintly, barely visible, the first spark of reserves beginning to refill. The bridge between exhaustion and capability, rebuilding. The cup, empty, starting to fill again.

She would come back. The promise was real. The method was real. The gap would close.

But first, she had to rest. And resting — for Neyla, for the healer who defined herself through what she gave — was the hardest thing of all.
