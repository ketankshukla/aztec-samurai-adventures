Chapter 15 - THE PURSUIT

Skyren covered the final evacuation from the sky and the sky showed her everything she needed to see and everything she didn't want to.

The freed population streamed east — five thousand people moving along the road that connected Kanezawa to the river crossing, the evacuation column stretching for nearly a mile. The column was slow — elderly people, children, the wounded and weakened, the particular pace that a civilian population maintained when urgency was limited by capability.

Dominion reinforcements were closing from the east. The rapid-response column that Skyren had spotted earlier — cavalry and infantry, approximately five hundred soldiers — was thirty minutes from the river crossing. If they reached the crossing before the evacuation column cleared it, the freed population would be caught between the reinforcements ahead and the pursuit behind.

Skyren assessed the timing from altitude. The column's pace. The reinforcements' speed. The distance between them. The mathematics were unfavorable — the reinforcements would reach the crossing approximately ten minutes before the column's tail cleared it.

Ten minutes. The gap between safety and catastrophe.

She spotted Miyako and Zariel riding hard from the temple — the horse galloping through the streets, pursued by Helisar's cavalry. The pursuit was closing — mounted soldiers on fresh horses against a single horse carrying double weight.

Skyren dove. The decision was instantaneous — the hawk rider's combat instinct overriding the operational caution that recommended maintaining altitude. Cielovar descended from two thousand feet in a controlled dive — the golden hawk's wings folded against his body, the aerodynamic profile producing the maximum velocity that gravity and biology could generate.

The dive-bomb struck the leading cavalry horse. Cielovar's talons — the predator's primary weapons, the curved, razor-sharp instruments that evolution had designed for exactly this purpose — raked the horse's hindquarters. The animal screamed. The rider lost control. The horse veered — crashing into the horse beside it, the collision producing the domino effect that disrupted the entire pursuit column.

The pursuit scattered. The cavalry's formation dissolved — horses spooked by the hawk's attack, riders struggling to control animals that were responding to the primal fear of an aerial predator. The scattering bought thirty seconds — the time required for the cavalry to reform and resume the chase.

Thirty seconds was enough. Zariel's horse reached the eastern approach and disappeared through the wall gap.

Skyren climbed. Back to altitude — the hawk rider's domain, the position from which she could see the whole picture and coordinate the operation's final phase. The picture was clear: the evacuation column was moving but too slowly. The reinforcements were approaching but could be delayed. The gap between safety and catastrophe was ten minutes.

She made a decision. The decision was reckless — the particular recklessness that existed when a person calculated the risk and decided that the risk was acceptable because the alternative was worse.

She flew into the Dominion reinforcement column.

Not an attack — a disruption. Skyren and her twelve hawk riders descended on the approaching column with every remaining smoke charge and explosive device they carried. The charges weren't designed for combat — they were signaling and confusion tools, the aerial equivalent of flashbangs, producing dense clouds of colored smoke and loud detonations that obscured vision and disrupted formation.

The effect was spectacular. The reinforcement column — five hundred soldiers marching in formation along the road — was suddenly enveloped in multicolored smoke and punctuated by explosions that were loud but not lethal. The soldiers reacted as soldiers reacted to unexpected aerial assault: they scattered. Formations dissolved. Officers shouted orders that couldn't be heard over the detonations. The organized column became a disorganized mass of confused, smoke-blinded soldiers who couldn't see the road or each other or the evacuation column that they had been sent to intercept.

The confusion bought twenty minutes. Not the ten that the mathematics required — twenty. The additional time was the product of the particular chaos that aerial disruption produced in ground-based formations — the extended period required for officers to reassemble scattered soldiers, confirm that the aerial threat had passed, and resume the march.

Twenty minutes. Enough for the evacuation column to clear the river crossing and establish the distance that safety required.

The column crossed. The freed population — five thousand people, the consciousness of an entire city — forded the river at the crossing point that Zariel's advance team had prepared. The water was cold — the autumn river carrying the chill of mountain runoff — but the crossing was shallow and the current was manageable.

On the far side, the Coravel territory began. The river was the boundary — the natural border that Coravel's maritime forces patrolled and that the Dominion's ground forces respected as the limit of their operational reach. Crossing the river meant crossing into safety — the particular, conditional, temporary safety that existed when geography and politics combined to create a barrier that an enemy chose not to breach.

The Dominion pursuit reached the river. The cavalry that had been chasing Zariel and Miyako. The reinforcement column that had been delayed by Skyren's aerial disruption. They converged at the river crossing and assessed the situation.

Five thousand freed people on the far side. Coravel territory. The diplomatic implications of crossing the river — of violating Coravel's sovereignty to recapture freed slaves — exceeded the tactical value of the recapture.

They stopped. The pursuit ended at the river. The Dominion forces stood on the near bank and watched five thousand people walk away from their enslavement and toward a future that the Dominion's machine had tried to prevent.

Skyren circled above. From altitude, the scene was clear — the river dividing two worlds, the Dominion on one side and freedom on the other, the five thousand freed people streaming into Coravel's territory with the particular, beautiful, chaotic movement of humanity in motion.

The evacuation was complete. The mission was accomplished. The anchor destroyed, the oaths broken, the people freed, the pursuit stopped at the river.

The cost was visible too. From altitude, Skyren could see Miyako — a small figure sitting on the riverbank, motionless, her posture carrying the particular stillness that Skyren had learned to read as something other than calm.

Miyako wasn't meditating. She was holding together. The shadow master who had descended into the temple basement and destroyed the anchor and fought through twenty guards and ridden to the river — that person was sitting on the bank and holding together with the last of the will that had sustained her through the longest day of her life.

Skyren descended. Lower. Low enough to see the face — the particular expression that the shadow master wore, the eyes that were open but looking at something that wasn't the river or the sky or the freed people.

Miyako was looking at something internal. Something that only she could see. And the expression on her face was not pain or grief or anger.

It was peace.

The particular, devastating peace that existed when a person had done what they needed to do and had paid what they needed to pay and was now sitting on a riverbank in the autumn sun, watching the evidence of their purpose walk toward freedom.

Skyren climbed back to altitude. The tears — the hawk rider's tears, falling at two thousand feet where no one could see them — were carried away by the wind before they could reach the ground.

The sky was the only honest place. And the sky was telling Skyren that the peace on Miyako's face was not the peace of completion.

It was the peace of ending.
