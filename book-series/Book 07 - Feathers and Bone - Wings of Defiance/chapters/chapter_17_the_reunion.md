Chapter 17 - THE REUNION

The alliance reunited at Hidden Valley for the second time, and this time the reunion tasted like victory and ash simultaneously.

The three groups converged over three days — Itzil's main army from the north, the Kanezawa team from the south, and the forward scouts who had been maintaining watch on the Dominion's movements. The valley received them with the quiet indifference of geography — the forested depression between mountain ridges unchanged since the first reunion, the stream still flowing, the canopy still blocking aerial observation.

The emotional weight was different this time. The first reunion had been survival — the relief of scattered pieces reconnecting, the discovery that the breaking hadn't been fatal. This reunion was something else. The alliance had struck back. The Kanezawa operation was destroyed. Five thousand people were free. The ash-oath system had suffered its first significant defeat.

But the cost was visible. Miyako arrived on a stretcher — the shadow master who had walked into the valley under her own power during the first reunion now carried by volunteers, her body wrapped in the field bandages that Neyla had applied during the march north. Her wounds were extensive — the accumulated damage from the anchor chamber, the temple fights, the pursuit — and her body's capacity to recover was diminishing with each hour.

Itzil saw everyone. The commander stood at the valley's center — the position that had become her default, the elevated ground where the Sun-Blade's golden light served as beacon and symbol — and watched the groups arrive with the particular attention of a leader who was counting faces and noting absences and assessing the state of an alliance that had been through fire and had emerged changed.

Kaelen was there. The scout had remained at Hidden Valley during the Kanezawa operation — maintaining the base, coordinating communications, performing the hundred tasks that kept the alliance's infrastructure functional while its most capable operatives were deployed elsewhere. He stood at the valley's edge and watched Itzil watch the arrivals and said nothing, because sometimes the most useful thing a scout could do was be present without requiring attention.

She noticed immediately: Miyako was wounded. The stretcher. The bandages. The particular stillness that the shadow master displayed — not the controlled calm of meditation but the rigid immobility of a person whose body couldn't move without producing pain that exceeded the threshold of tolerance.

"How bad?" Itzil asked Neyla. The question was private — delivered during the healer's approach, before the formal reunion gathered the full team.

Neyla's face told the answer before her words did. The healer's expression carried the particular quality that medical professionals displayed when the prognosis was clear and the clarity was unwelcome.

"The surface wounds are treated. But the internal damage — organs, bones, the systems that maintain life — it's beyond field repair. She needs rest. Weeks. Months." A pause. "And even with rest, the trajectory is..."

"Tell me."

"She's dying, Itzil. Not from the wounds — from the accumulated damage. Her body has been pushed past the point of recovery. The Kanezawa mission accelerated what age was already doing."

Itzil processed this. The command mask held — the controlled expression that she had perfected, the face that the alliance needed to see when the news was bad. But behind the mask, the processing was personal. Miyako — the shadow master who had taught Kaelen, who had trained the army, who had given Itzil advice that sounded like a farewell because it was a farewell.

Korvain, on his stretcher, saw Miyako on hers. Two old warriors. The particular recognition that existed between people who were approaching the same destination from different directions.

Korvain reached for her hand. His grip was weak — the trembling fingers that could no longer hold a blade finding the fingers of a woman whose blade-hand was bandaged and swollen.

"You went back," Korvain said.

"I did," Miyako said.

"Good."

The word contained everything — the approval of a martial master for a colleague's decision, the respect of a warrior for another warrior's sacrifice, the understanding that existed between two people who knew the cost of their choices and had paid it.

Itzil briefed the full team. The council assembled — the stone table, the maps, the golden light. All ten heroes present: Itzil, Kaelen, Jagren, Neyla, Torvane, Zariel, Skyren, Rainara, Miyako (on a stretcher), Solkren. Korvain on his stretcher, positioned beside Miyako.

"The Kanezawa operation was a significant victory," Itzil said. Her voice carried the measured confidence that the briefing required — the commander's delivery that balanced achievement with reality. "Five thousand people freed. A major ash-oath facility destroyed. Helisar's operation disrupted."

She paused. The pause was deliberate — the space between achievement and cost, the breath that separated what they had won from what they had paid.

"Korvain is declining. Miyako is wounded. Amalura is still captured. The Starless Crown is at approximately fifty-five percent. The strategic picture has improved but the timeline hasn't changed."

The council absorbed this. The faces around the table were tired but focused — the faces of people who had been through enough to understand that victories in this war were never clean and costs were never optional.

For one night, the team was together. All ten heroes. Korvain. They ate together — the communal meal that the alliance's logistics could provide, the food plain but sufficient, the company irreplaceable.

They laughed. Genuine laughter — the first in months, the particular sound that existed when people who had been through terrible things together allowed themselves to acknowledge that they were alive and that being alive included the capacity for joy.

Jagren told a story about falling off a horse during the Thalendor retreat. The story was self-deprecating — the duelist who had been performing spectacular feats of martial skill described, with theatrical precision, the moment when his horse stopped suddenly and he didn't. The description was detailed. The landing was undignified. The audience's laughter was real.

Even Torvane smiled. The engineer — whose default expression was the focused concentration of a mind perpetually processing calculations — allowed the corners of his mouth to lift in the particular configuration that, for Torvane, constituted hilarity.

Skyren laughed loudly. The hawk rider's laugh was the loudest sound in the valley — the unrestrained expression of a person who processed everything at maximum volume and whose joy was as expansive as her flight paths.

Miyako listened. The shadow master — on her stretcher, her wounds bandaged, her body failing — listened to the laughter and the stories and the particular warmth that existed when people who loved each other were together.

She smiled. The expression was small — the economy of motion that her injuries dictated. But the smile was real. The warmth was real. The presence — the act of being here, with these people, in this moment — was the thing that mattered.

The reader should savor it. The team was together. All of them. The laughter was genuine. The night was warm. The stars were visible — except where the Crown ate them.

It was the last time they would all be together.

The war would take one of them. Soon. The cost that victories demanded and that the people who fought them paid. The particular, devastating arithmetic that converted living people into remembered names.

But tonight, the arithmetic was suspended. Tonight, the team laughed. Tonight, the fire crackled and the stars turned and the people who had chosen to fight the impossible war sat together and remembered that the reason they fought was the capacity for moments exactly like this.

Tonight was enough.

Tomorrow would be different.
