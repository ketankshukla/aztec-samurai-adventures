Chapter 19 - MIYAKO'S WOUNDS

Neyla examined Miyako on the third night of the march and the examination confirmed what the healer already knew.

They were camped in a mountain pass — the army spread along the narrow corridor between peaks, the fires burning low to minimize visibility, the march's rhythm paused for the rest that human bodies required even when the timeline demanded otherwise. The medical tent was positioned at the column's center — the standard deployment that Neyla maintained, the healing infrastructure accessible to the greatest number of soldiers.

Miyako sat on a camp stool. The shadow master's posture was upright — the discipline maintaining the vertical alignment that her body wanted to abandon, the will overriding the systems that were telling her to lie down and not get up. Her wounds were bandaged — the field dressings that Neyla had applied after Kanezawa, changed daily, the treatment that managed the surface damage while the deeper damage progressed.

Neyla's diagnostic perception — the healing sense that allowed her to assess a patient's condition through proximity — told the story that the bandages concealed. The turquoise light flowed from Neyla's hands to Miyako's body — not healing but assessing, the diagnostic mode that mapped the patient's internal state without attempting to alter it.

The map was devastating.

The ribs were cracked in three places. The fractures had been partially set by Neyla's earlier treatment but had been aggravated by the march — every step producing micro-movements that prevented the healing process from completing. The bones were knitting slowly. Too slowly.

The left shoulder's nerve damage was progressive. The numbness that had begun after the anchor chamber's first blast was extending — the affected area spreading from the shoulder down the arm, the fingers losing sensation and motor control in a pattern that indicated nerve death rather than nerve compression.

The internal organs were strained. The liver and kidneys — the organs that processed the metabolic byproducts of extreme physical exertion — were showing the signs of sustained overload. The values that Neyla's diagnostic perception measured were elevated. Not critically — not yet. But the trajectory was toward failure.

The heart was weakened. The cardiac muscle — stressed by the anchor chamber's exertion, the temple fights, the pursuit — was operating at reduced capacity. The rhythm was irregular. The output was diminished. The heart that had sustained sixty-three years of shadow-school training was approaching the limits of its endurance.

Neyla could heal the surface wounds. She could reduce the inflammation. She could manage the pain. But the deep damage — the organs, the nerves, the cardiac muscle — was beyond the field healing that her capabilities provided. The damage required rest. Weeks of rest. Possibly months.

And even with rest, the trajectory was clear.

"You need to stop," Neyla said. Her voice was quiet — the private delivery that medical professionals used when the information was personal and the audience was one. "The march is killing you. Every step aggravates the internal damage. If you push like this again—"

"I know," Miyako said. The interruption was gentle — the shadow master's controlled delivery, the particular calm that existed when a person had accepted information that others were still processing. "I know what's happening."

"Then stop. Rest. Let the army march without you. We can—"

"You can't heal this, Neyla." The words were not cruel — they were factual. The particular, devastating honesty of a patient who understood their own prognosis better than the doctor wanted to admit. "The damage is cumulative. It started before Kanezawa — before the war. My body has been running on borrowed time for years. The war accelerated the debt. Kanezawa collected it."

"I can try—"

"You can try. And you'll spend healing energy on a patient whose trajectory is fixed while other patients — patients who can recover, who have years ahead of them, whose injuries are treatable — wait." Miyako looked at Neyla. The shadow master's dark eyes — still sharp, still carrying the intelligence that had defined her — held the healer's gaze with the particular steadiness that accompanied words that needed to be heard. "Don't waste your gift on me. You taught me that — 'save it for someone you can save.'"

The words stung. Not because they were unkind — because they were the echo of Neyla's own philosophy, the triage principle that she had developed during months of wartime medicine. Prioritize the patients who can be saved. Allocate resources where they produce the greatest return. The principle was sound. The principle was correct. And the principle, applied to Miyako, was devastating.

"Promise me you won't—" Neyla began.

"I don't make promises I can't keep." Miyako smiled. The expression was warm — the particular warmth that existed between two women who had formed a bond during the war, the connection that transcended professional roles and reached the personal. "You taught me that."

Neyla watched Miyako walk away. Slowly — favoring her left side, the gait asymmetric, the body compensating for injuries that it couldn't overcome. The shadow master moved through the camp with the particular dignity that she maintained regardless of circumstances — the upright posture, the measured steps, the economy of motion that was both discipline and necessity.

Neyla knew what she was seeing. She had seen it before — in terminal patients, in the elderly whose bodies were winding down, in the particular category of people whose systems were failing and whose will was the only thing maintaining function. The body was shutting down. The shadow-school discipline was holding it together. When the discipline failed — when the will that sustained it was finally exceeded by the damage that opposed it — the collapse would be swift and final.

Days. Maybe weeks. Not more.

The healer stood in the medical tent and felt the particular, devastating helplessness that existed when a medical professional confronted a patient she couldn't save and a prognosis she couldn't change. The turquoise light dimmed — the healing magic responding to the healer's emotional state, the energy that should have been steady flickering with the particular instability that grief produced.

She breathed. Four counts in. Seven counts hold. Eight counts out. The technique that Miyako had taught her — through Kaelen, through the chain of knowledge that connected the shadow master to the healer through the scout who served as the link between them. Miyako's lesson. Miyako's gift. The bridge between exhaustion and capability that had kept Neyla functional through months of impossible demands.

The bridge held. The reserves stabilized. The turquoise light steadied.

Neyla turned to the next patient. A soldier with a sprained ankle from the march. Treatable. Recoverable. A patient who could be saved.

She saved him. She moved to the next. And the next. The continuous, grinding, essential work of wartime medicine — healing the healable, managing the manageable, accepting the unacceptable.

Miyako walked through the camp. The autumn night was cold. The stars were visible — except where the Crown consumed them. The army slept around her — three thousand seven hundred soldiers resting before tomorrow's march, the breathing of thousands of people creating the particular sound that existed when a population was at rest.

She didn't sleep. She sat at the camp's edge and looked south — toward the temple, toward the relic, toward the battle that was coming. The blade lay across her knees. The weapon that had been her companion for forty years — the extension of her body and her will — rested in hands that could barely hold it.

She held it anyway. Because the blade was who she was. And who she was — even at the end, even failing — was enough.
