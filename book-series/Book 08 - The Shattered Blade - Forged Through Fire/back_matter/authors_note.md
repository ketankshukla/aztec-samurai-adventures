# Author's Note

Thank you for reading *The Shattered Blade*.

This book breaks three things: a weapon, a mentor, and a reader's heart. I know because it broke mine while I was writing it.

The Sun-Blade's destruction was planned from the beginning. The blade was always going to shatter — not because Itzil failed, but because the blade needed to fail so that Itzil could discover she didn't need it. The crutch had to break before the person could stand on their own.

Korvain's death was the hardest scene I've written since Miyako's. Not because of the death itself — Korvain earned his rest, and he died peacefully, which is more than most warriors in this series can hope for. It was hard because of what his death means for Itzil. The safety net is gone. The last person who could catch her if she fell is no longer there. She has to stand alone.

Except she doesn't. That's the lesson that Kaelen delivers in Chapter 18 — the words that pull her back from the edge. "Just you is enough." Not the blade. Not the prophecy. Not the mentors. Her. The person who shows up.

The first kiss between Itzil and Kaelen was not romantic. It was desperate. Two people holding onto each other because everything else had shattered. I think that's more honest than any candlelit scene could be. Love in wartime isn't gentle. It's a grip. It's the refusal to let go.

And Solkren. The armorer no one watches. The quiet man who holds a fragment to the firelight and whispers "I see you." The seed of everything that comes next.

Act II ends here. The Breaking is complete. Books 5 through 8 have scattered the alliance, killed two beloved heroes, shattered the Sun-Blade, and brought the world to the edge of extinction.

Act III begins with Book 9: The Forge of Souls. The rescue. The reforging. The reckoning.

Hold on. It gets better. I promise.

With gratitude,
