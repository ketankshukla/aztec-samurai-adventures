# A Quick Favor

If Korvain's last lesson meant something to you — if "the blade broke, good" hit you the way it hit Itzil — would you consider leaving a review on Amazon?

Reviews help other readers find the series. And they help me keep writing stories about people who lose everything and discover that what remains is enough.

Even a single sentence:

> *"The blade broke and I wasn't ready because..."*

Thank you for reading. Thank you for standing with these characters through the darkest part of their story. Act III is coming. And it starts with a rescue.
