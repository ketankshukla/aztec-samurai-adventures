# Book Description — Aztec Samurai Adventures Book 8: The Shattered Blade - Forged Through Fire

## Subtitle: Forged Through Fire

---

<b>The blade breaks. The mentor dies. And the girl who held the sun discovers what she is without it.</b>

<p>Itzil races south to claim the last sacred relic before the Dominion can seize it. She enters an ancient temple that tests her soul — three fears, three truths, no mercy. She passes. She claims the Sunheart. She emerges into a battle she wasn't prepared for.</p>

<p><b>In this book:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>A temple trial that shows the bearer her deepest fears — and kills her if she lies</li>
<li>The duel of the series: Sun-Blade bearer vs. blood-magic spymaster</li>
<li>The Sun-Blade shatters — destroyed from within by a corrosion spell no one saw coming</li>
<li>A commander fights without her weapon and discovers the weapon was never the point</li>
<li>A mentor's final lesson: "The blade broke. Good."</li>
<li>The first kiss — desperate, raw, real — between two people holding onto each other because everything else has shattered</li>
<li>An armorer holds a fragment to the firelight and whispers: "I see you"</li>
</ul>

<p>The Shattered Blade is the climax of Act II — the moment where everything breaks so that everything can be rebuilt. The lowest point becomes the launch pad. The girl in the dark becomes the leader who doesn't need the light.</p>

<p>For fans of <i>The Way of Kings</i>, <i>The Poppy War</i>, and stories where the hero's greatest weapon isn't what they carry but who they are — a book about losing everything and discovering that what remains is enough.</p>

<p><i>"Just you is enough."</i></p>

<p><b>Book 8 of 12 in the <i>Aztec Samurai Adventures</i> series. The final book of Act II: The Breaking. From Ketan Shukla, published by Metronagon.</b></p>
