# Chapter 1 Summary — THE RACE SOUTH

**POV:** Itzil

Alliance army races south toward the Sun-Blade temple. Miyako's death is days old — Itzil moves harder, faster, with an edge. Korvain rides in a wagon, mind sharp, body failing.

Skyren's intelligence: Dominion force led by Nightshade and the surviving Ashvanar brother. They'll reach the temple in five days. Alliance will reach it in four — if they don't stop. "We don't stop."

**Key Events:** Southern march, Miyako's grief driving Itzil, Dominion race confirmed, one-day lead established.

**Cliffhanger:** Four days. One-day lead. The race for the Sunheart relic has begun.
