# Chapter 2 Summary — KORVAIN'S LAST MAP

**POV:** Korvain

Korvain briefs Itzil on the temple: three levels — outer ruins, warded inner sanctum, Heart Chamber. The wards test the bearer's soul, not combat. "It shows you what you fear most. If you lie, it kills you."

He reveals: "The Sun-Blade can be reforged. But only if it's first broken." He doesn't explain further. Coughs — wet, deep. Waves Neyla away: "Save your magic."

**Key Events:** Temple layout briefed, soul-test wards described, blade reforging revelation, Korvain's declining health.

**Cliffhanger:** He needs to last long enough to see her through this. The hours are running out.
