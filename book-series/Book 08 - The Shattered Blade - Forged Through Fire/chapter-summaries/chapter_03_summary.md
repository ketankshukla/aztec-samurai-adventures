# Chapter 3 Summary — NIGHTSHADE'S PURSUIT

**POV:** Nightshade (Villain)

Nightshade leads the Dominion force south. The Ashvanar brother burns with revenge. Valdremor's plan via blood-mirror: let the heroes reach the temple first. If the trial kills the bearer, walk in. If she succeeds, break her blade.

Valdremor provides the corrosion technique — blood-magic targeting the blade's core resonance, eating it from within. Nightshade memorizes it. The one weapon she fears — now she knows how to destroy it.

**Key Events:** Ashvanar brother managed, Valdremor's plan received, corrosion spell technique memorized, two-pronged strategy (weaken blade + disable Kaelen).

**Cliffhanger:** Nightshade knows how to destroy the Sun-Blade. The mechanism is complete.
