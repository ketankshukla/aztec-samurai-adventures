# Chapter 4 Summary — THE TEMPLE RUINS

**POV:** Itzil

Alliance arrives first. Temple ruins are breathtaking — sun-glyphs, golden vines, sacred ground. Torvane establishes defenses. Jagren organizes perimeter. Dominion one day behind.

Korvain is carried to the entrance. "I can't go in. Only you." He looks at her like a parent watching a child leave home. Itzil steps through the ward-wall alone. Inside: the temple is restored, not ruined. A voice speaks: "Sun-Blade bearer. Welcome. Your trial begins."

**Key Events:** Temple reached, defenses established, Korvain's farewell look, Itzil enters alone, temple restored inside wards.

**Cliffhanger:** Inside the ward, the world changes. The trial begins.
