# Chapter 5 Summary — THE TRIAL OF FEARS

**POV:** Itzil

Three chambers, three fears. Fear One: her team dead — every one of them. "Can you face it?" She walks through, accepting the fear without denial. Fear Two: herself as Volzentar, powerful and alone. "Will won't save you. Only vigilance will." Fear Three: nothing. Emptiness. Just a girl in the dark.

"I'm not the perfect leader. I'm the one who showed up." The emptiness dissolves. The Heart Chamber opens.

**Key Events:** Three fears faced — failure, corruption, emptiness. All passed through honesty, not denial. Heart Chamber opens.

**Cliffhanger:** Not perfection. Presence. That's what the temple required.
