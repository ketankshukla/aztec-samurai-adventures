# Chapter 6 Summary — THE SUNHEART

**POV:** Itzil

The Heart Chamber. The Sunheart — a crystal burning with inner fire. When Itzil touches it, a vision: the Great Gate fully open, VASTRIX pressing through — not a creature but a FORCE, an ocean of hunger wearing a crown of dead stars.

The temple's final words: "The blade will break. It was always going to break. What matters is what you do after." She exits the ward-wall carrying the Sunheart — directly into a battle. Nightshade's forces attacking the perimeter.

**Key Events:** Sunheart claimed, Vastrix vision experienced, temple prophecy delivered, emergence into battle.

**Cliffhanger:** "There she is. Break her." Nightshade's voice cuts through the chaos.
