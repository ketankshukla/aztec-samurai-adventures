# Chapter 8 Summary — THE ASHVANAR'S FURY

**POV:** Itzil

The surviving Ashvanar brother attacks with berserk rage — lightning, earthquakes, cascading fire. Screams his dead brother's name with every spell. Jagren intercepts — this is personal.

Torvane deploys a ward-disruptor weakening sorcery by 40%. Jagren closes to blade range. Vicious three-minute duel. Jagren wounds the Ashvanar badly. Sorcerer retreats — not dead but neutralized.

**Key Events:** Ashvanar's berserk assault, Torvane's ward-disruptor, Jagren vs. Ashvanar duel, Ashvanar wounded and neutralized.

**Cliffhanger:** The Ashvanar is down. Nightshade remains. And the real attack hasn't started yet.
