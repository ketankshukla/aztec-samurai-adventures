# Chapter 9 Summary — NIGHTSHADE STRIKES

**POV:** Nightshade (Villain)

Nightshade deploys the corrosion spell from distance — blood-magic targeting the blade's core resonance through blood-mirrors. Subtle, invisible, eating the blade from within. Also targets Kaelen through old blood-magic scars — pain lancing through his wounds.

Two-pronged attack: weaken the blade, disable the scout. Strip Itzil of weapon and closest ally. The final syllable spoken. Inside the blade, something cracks. Microscopic. Internal. The damage has begun.

**Key Events:** Corrosion spell initiated via blood-mirrors, Kaelen targeted through old wounds, blade's dimensional foundation compromised.

**Cliffhanger:** The blade doesn't notice yet. But the damage has begun.
