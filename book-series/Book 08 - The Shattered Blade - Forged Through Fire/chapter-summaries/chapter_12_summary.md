# Chapter 12 Summary — THE BLADE SHATTERS

**POV:** Itzil

The Sun-Blade explodes. Catastrophic failure — golden light collapses inward, erupts outward. Everyone knocked flat. Itzil thrown ten feet. She looks at her hand: a hilt. No blade. Golden shards scattered, cooling, dying.

Silence on the battlefield. Both sides stare. Nightshade stands over her: "Just a girl with a broken sword. That's all you ever were." For the first time since Book 1, Itzil has nothing.

**Key Events:** Sun-Blade destroyed, shockwave across battlefield, Itzil disarmed, Nightshade dominant, total silence.

**Cliffhanger:** The blade is dust. The temple's words echo: "What matters is what you do after."
