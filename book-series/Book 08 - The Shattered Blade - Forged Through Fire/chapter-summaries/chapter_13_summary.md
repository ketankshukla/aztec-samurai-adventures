# Chapter 13 Summary — FIGHTING WITH NOTHING

**POV:** Itzil

Itzil fights without the blade — fists, kicks, scavenged sword. She doesn't win but doesn't die. Every technique Korvain taught her, every discipline Miyako modeled.

Kaelen arrives despite his wound. Jagren charges from the flank. Rainara creates a water-wall blocking blood-magic. The team protects their commander — not because of the blade, because of HER. Nightshade retreats, taking a blade fragment as trophy.

**Key Events:** Bladeless combat, team rallies to protect Itzil, Nightshade takes fragment and retreats, strategic trade — Dominion broke blade but didn't get relic.

**Cliffhanger:** They don't need her blade. They need HER. The person remained.
