# Chapter 14 Summary — THE AFTERMATH

**POV:** Itzil

Itzil sits in the ruins holding blade fragments — collecting every shard on hands and knees. The fragments are cold. No golden light. Just metal. She arranges them in the blade's shape. Incomplete.

The blade was more than a weapon — it was her identity. Without it: "Just a girl in the dark." She collects every fragment. She doesn't know why. She just can't leave them behind.

**Key Events:** Fragment collection, emotional devastation, identity crisis, strategic assessment (Dominion traded relic for blade).

**Cliffhanger:** She collects every fragment. The evidence of loss that is also, somehow, possibility.
