# Chapter 15 Summary — KORVAIN'S LAST NIGHT

**POV:** Korvain

That night. Korvain is worse. He asks to see Itzil. She shows him the fragments, trying not to cry. "It's gone." He touches a fragment. Closes his eyes. And smiles.

"The blade broke. Good." His final lesson: the blade was a crutch — the certainty it gave her. "Now you know you don't need it. You never did." She opens her mouth to argue — and closes it. Because he's right.

**Key Events:** Korvain's final lesson delivered, "the blade broke — good," blade as crutch explained, Itzil accepts the truth.

**Cliffhanger:** The last thing he teaches her. The most important lesson of all.
