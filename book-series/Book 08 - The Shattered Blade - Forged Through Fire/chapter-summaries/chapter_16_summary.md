# Chapter 16 Summary — KORVAIN DIES

**POV:** Itzil

Korvain sleeps peacefully. Itzil sits beside him through the night. At dawn, she wakes. He's still. His hand is cold.

**KORVAIN DIES.** The Last Grandmaster. Peacefully, in his sleep. He earned his rest. Itzil holds his hand for a long time. Walks outside. The camp sees her face. They know. Kaelen finds her crying openly — the only time in the series. "I just wish he was still here to be right about things."

Eulogy: "He was the best of us. He taught me everything. And his last lesson was that he didn't need to teach me anymore."

**Key Events:** Korvain's peaceful death, Itzil's open grief, Kaelen's silent support, cremation in Sun-Blade tradition, three-sentence eulogy.

**Cliffhanger:** The safety net is gone. The student stands alone.
