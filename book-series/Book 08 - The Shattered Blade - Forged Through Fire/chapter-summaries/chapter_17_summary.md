# Chapter 17 Summary — THE LOWEST POINT

**POV:** Itzil

The absolute lowest: blade shattered, Korvain dead, Miyako dead, Amalura captive, army depleted, Crown at ~60%. Itzil goes through motions of command but her eyes are empty.

Council debates retreat, attack, negotiation. Itzil says nothing. The silence terrifies her allies. In her tent, fragments on the table, she considers for the first time that the war is lost.

**Key Events:** Strategic picture at worst, council debates without decision, Itzil's silence, consideration of surrender.

**Cliffhanger:** Just a girl in the dark. Without the blade. Without the teacher. The lowest point waits.
