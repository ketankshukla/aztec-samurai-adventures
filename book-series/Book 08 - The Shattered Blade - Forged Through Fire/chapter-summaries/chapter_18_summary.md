# Chapter 18 Summary — KAELEN'S WORDS

**POV:** Kaelen

Kaelen finds Itzil in her tent. "Are you done? Because I'm not." He kneels, takes her hands. "The blade is broken. Korvain is gone. And you're still HERE. That's you, Itzil. Just you. And just you is enough."

She says: "Don't leave." "Never." She kisses him. **THE FIRST KISS.** Not romantic — desperate, raw, real. Two people holding onto each other because everything else has shattered.

**Key Events:** Kaelen's intervention, "just you is enough" speech, first kiss, emotional connection acknowledged, lowest point ends.

**Cliffhanger:** The world is falling apart. But they're not. The ascent begins.
