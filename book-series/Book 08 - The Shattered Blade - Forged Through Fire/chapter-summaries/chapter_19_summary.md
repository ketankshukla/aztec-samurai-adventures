# Chapter 19 Summary — SOLKREN NOTICES

**POV:** Solkren

First extended Solkren POV. The armorer examines the blade fragments — they still resonate. Not dead but dormant. Like seeds waiting to grow. The blade was DESIGNED to break. To be reforged into something greater.

He holds a fragment to the firelight. It pulses — faint golden light deep inside. Still alive. He whispers: "I see you." The seed of Book 9's soul forge.

**Key Events:** Fragment resonance discovered, dormant not dead, reforging potential confirmed, "I see you" moment, nobody notices the armorer.

**Cliffhanger:** The most important discovery of the war, made by the person no one is watching.
