# Chapter 20 Summary — VALDREMOR'S TRANSMISSION

**POV:** Valdremor (Villain)

Valdremor receives Nightshade's report: Sun-Blade destroyed. He doesn't need the Sunheart — ash-oath energy can substitute. Less elegant but sufficient. He accelerates Gate preparations.

Ultimatum broadcast to all kingdoms: "Surrender now or face what comes through the Gate." The sky above the capital cracks — a fissure, red light bleeding through. For the first time: a flicker of doubt. "Have I gone too far?" He pushes it aside.

**Key Events:** Strategic assessment, ash-oath energy as relic substitute, Gate acceleration, surrender ultimatum, sky fissure, Valdremor's doubt, Serenthar weeps.

**Cliffhanger:** The sky cracks. Vastrix whispers: "Soon."
