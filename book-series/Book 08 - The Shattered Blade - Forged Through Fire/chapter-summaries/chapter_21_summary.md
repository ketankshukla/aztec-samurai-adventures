# Chapter 21 Summary — THE ARMY DECIDES

**POV:** Itzil

Itzil emerges from grief. Addresses the council: "The blade is broken. But I'm not. And neither are we." Presents the situation honestly — need to rescue Amalura, the one person whose knowledge can counter Valdremor.

"If we do nothing, everyone dies. If we do something, MAYBE everyone lives. I choose maybe." The army votes with their feet. They stand. They follow. Not because of the blade. Because of her.

**Key Events:** Itzil's return to leadership, honest strategic assessment, Amalura rescue prioritized, "I choose maybe," army follows.

**Cliffhanger:** They follow because of her. Just her. And just her is enough.
