# Chapter 22 Summary — PLANNING ACT III

**POV:** Kaelen

Kaelen maps the next phase: 1) Rescue Amalura, 2) Reforge the blade, 3) Close/disrupt the Great Gate, 4) Defeat Vastrix. "Any one is nearly impossible. All four together is insane." Itzil: "Then we'd better be fast."

Detailed rescue plan: detention tower on unwarded river, Rainara's water vector, guard rotations mapped. Neyla's ash-oath reversal now reliable. Eleven anchors to destroy to drain the Gate's power source.

**Key Events:** Four strategic objectives mapped, Amalura rescue planned in detail, ash-oath network strategy, eleven-anchor campaign proposed.

**Cliffhanger:** "When do we move?" "Yesterday. But tomorrow works too."
