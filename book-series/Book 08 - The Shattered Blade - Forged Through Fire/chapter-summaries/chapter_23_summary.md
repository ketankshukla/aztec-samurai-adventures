# Chapter 23 Summary — THE SKY BREAKS

**POV:** Itzil

Starless Crown jumps to 65% — visible worldwide. Refugees flood allied territory. Dominion deserters bring intel: Gate being forced open, Valdremor burning ash-oath slaves at accelerating rate. Fissure above capital growing.

Itzil feels the wrongness even without the blade. Public declaration: "The sky is breaking. We are the only people standing between that door and everyone we've ever loved. So we stand." Grim cheer — the sound of people who know and face it anyway.

**Key Events:** Crown visible worldwide, refugees and deserters arriving, sky fissure growing, Itzil's speech, army's grim determination.

**Cliffhanger:** The army stands. Not a triumphant cheer. A grim one. They know what's coming.
