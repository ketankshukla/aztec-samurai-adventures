# Chapter 24 Summary — THE PROMISE

**POV:** Itzil

Night. Itzil and Kaelen at the edge of camp, looking at the Crown. Partners. Equals. The fragments are warm — faintly, like something alive. "Solkren's been spending a lot of time with those fragments."

"We're going to rescue Amalura. We're going to reforge the blade. And we're going to close that Gate." "That's impossible." "Then it's a good thing we're not the kind of people who do possible things."

Hand in hand, they look at the broken sky. Valdremor's ultimatum echoes. Serenthar weeps as futures converge. Solkren holds a fragment to the firelight — golden pulse. And Vastrix whispers: **"Soon."**

**Key Events:** Itzil-Kaelen partnership solidified, warm fragments noted, four-objective promise made, Serenthar's prophecy, Solkren's discovery, Vastrix stirs.

**Cliffhanger:** Act II ends. The promise is made. The chain is fragile. The probability is not zero. And not-zero is enough.
