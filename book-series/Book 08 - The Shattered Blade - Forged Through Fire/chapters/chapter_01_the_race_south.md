Chapter 1 - THE RACE SOUTH

The army moved with the particular urgency of people who understood that every hour mattered and that the hours were running out.

Itzil led from the front — the commander's position in the column's vanguard, the Sun-Blade warm at her hip, the golden light a constant that the marching soldiers oriented toward the way travelers oriented toward a star. She moved harder than she had before Miyako's death. Faster. With an edge that hadn't been there before — the particular sharpness that grief produced when grief was compressed into purpose rather than allowed to expand into paralysis.

She didn't talk about Miyako. She didn't need to. Everyone could see it — in the way she moved, in the set of her jaw, in the particular quality of her silence that was different from the command silence she had maintained before. The before-silence had been control. This silence was armor. The difference was visible to anyone who knew her well enough to read it.

Kaelen knew her well enough. The scout moved at the column's edge — the position that his role demanded, the perimeter awareness that kept the army safe from ambush and surprise. But his attention, beneath the professional scanning that was his default state, tracked Itzil with the particular focus that existed when a person was worried about someone they cared about and was managing the worry by maintaining proximity.

The southern march had entered its second week. The terrain was ancient — the landscape that the pre-Gate civilization had occupied three thousand years ago, the geography carrying the traces of a culture that had left its mark on the world in weathered stone foundations and the faint hum of magical residue. The air was different here — charged with something that the soldiers couldn't name but could feel, the particular quality that existed in places where enormous power had been concentrated and where the residue of that power persisted long after the power itself was gone.

The Sun-Blade responded to the terrain. The weapon's warmth increased as they moved south — the ancient connection between the blade and the land that had created it producing a resonance that Itzil felt as a deepening of the warmth at her hip. The blade was coming home. The weapon that had been carried by generations of bearers across centuries of time was approaching the place where it had been forged, and the approach was producing a response that was simultaneously physical and dimensional.

Skyren's intelligence arrived at midday — the hawk rider descending from altitude with the efficient urgency that characterized her reconnaissance reports. The delivery was clipped. Essential.

"Dominion force confirmed. Southeast approach, different route, same destination. Led by Nightshade and the surviving Ashvanar brother. Current pace puts them at the temple in five days."

Nightshade. The spymaster who had taken Amalura. The blood-magic practitioner whose operational capability had been demonstrated at Thornhaven with devastating effectiveness. And the Ashvanar brother — the surviving half of the sorcerer pair, the one whose sibling had been killed in Book 4, the one whose grief had been fermenting into rage for months.

"Five days for them," Itzil said. "How long for us?"

"Four. If you don't stop."

Four days. A one-day lead — the margin between reaching the Sunheart first and arriving to find it already in Dominion hands. The margin was thin. The margin required the army to maintain the accelerated pace that had been grinding the soldiers' endurance for days.

"We don't stop," Itzil said.

Korvain rode in a wagon — the grandmaster's body too weak for walking, too fragile for horseback, the particular accommodation that the army provided for a person whose mind was invaluable and whose body was failing. The wagon was positioned at the column's center — protected, accessible, the strategic counsel that Korvain provided available to the command staff without requiring the grandmaster to move.

He studied maps. The ancient charts of the southern territories that the alliance's intelligence archive contained — documents that predated the current war by centuries, the cartographic records of a region that few living people had visited. Korvain had been to the Sun-Blade temple once — fifty years ago, as a young warrior making the pilgrimage that the light school's tradition required. The memory was old but clear. The temple had been sacred then. Sacred and deadly.

He briefed Itzil during the evening halt — the brief rest that the column took before the night march that the accelerated timeline demanded. The briefing was delivered from the wagon, Korvain's voice carrying the diminished volume that his failing lungs produced but maintaining the clarity that his undimmed mind ensured.

"Three levels. The outer ruins are accessible — that's where you'll establish the defensive perimeter. The inner sanctum is warded — only a Sun-Blade bearer can pass. The Heart Chamber is the deepest level — that's where the Sunheart rests."

"What about the wards?"

"Ancient. Designed by the original builders. They don't test combat capability — they test something else." He paused. The particular pause that preceded important information that the speaker was choosing how to deliver. "The temple tests the bearer's soul. It shows you what you fear most. It asks if you're willing to face it. If you lie, it kills you."

The information settled. The ward system was not a defense — it was a filter. The temple's designers had created a mechanism that allowed only a worthy bearer to access the relic, and worthiness was measured not by power but by honesty. The ability to face fear without denial. The willingness to acknowledge what was true rather than what was comfortable.

"I'll go in alone," Itzil said.

"You have to. The wards don't admit companions."

The army marched. Night fell. The column moved through darkness — the particular, exhausting night march that the timeline demanded, the soldiers navigating by the golden light of the Sun-Blade that Itzil carried and by the stars that remained visible despite the Starless Crown's consumption.

The Crown was larger. Visible even from the southern territories — the ring of void hanging above the northern horizon, the darkness eating stars with the accelerating pace that the Dominion's expanded ash-oath operations were producing. The Crown was at approximately fifty-eight percent. The closure was accelerating.

Kaelen's scout report arrived before dawn. The scout had been ranging ahead of the main column — two miles, three, the forward reconnaissance that identified the terrain the army would cross during the next day's march. His report was delivered with the flat professionalism that characterized all his intelligence products.

"Dominion force adjusted course. They're pushing harder — double-time march. The Ashvanar brother is driving them. Nightshade is maintaining tactical discipline but the brother's urgency is increasing the pace." A pause. "They'll reach the temple in five days at their current rate. We'll reach it in four. If we don't stop."

"We don't stop," Itzil repeated.

The race continued. Two forces moving south through ancient territory — one led by a commander with a golden blade, the other led by a spymaster with blood-magic. One carrying hope. The other carrying a plan to destroy it.

The temple waited. The Sunheart waited. The trial waited.

And the clock — the Starless Crown's inexorable consumption of the sky — continued to count down the time that everyone had left.
