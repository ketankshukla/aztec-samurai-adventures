Chapter 2 - KORVAIN'S LAST MAP

The maps were old and the man reading them was older, and both were running out of time.

Korvain spread the ancient charts across the wagon's flat surface — the documents that the alliance's intelligence archive had preserved from a era when the southern territories were studied rather than feared. The charts were hand-drawn — the cartographic techniques of a civilization that predated the current nations by centuries, the precise linework and symbolic notation that scholars like Amalura could read fluently and that Korvain could read adequately.

He had been to the Sun-Blade temple once. Fifty years ago — a young warrior of twenty-three, making the pilgrimage that the light school's tradition required of every practitioner who achieved the rank of journeyman. The pilgrimage was a test — not the temple's test, which was reserved for Sun-Blade bearers, but the school's test, which required the journeyman to travel to the temple's outer ruins, meditate for three days, and return with an account of what they had experienced.

The memory was clear. The temple had been magnificent — ancient stone carved with sun-glyphs that caught the light and threw it back in patterns that seemed to move, golden vines growing over the ruins with the particular vitality that magical soil produced, the entire structure half-swallowed by the earth as though the land itself was trying to reclaim the building that had been placed upon it.

Sacred. Deadly. The two qualities existing simultaneously in a place where enormous power had been concentrated for an enormous purpose and where the residue of that power persisted with the particular patience of magic that had been designed to last forever.

He briefed Itzil in the evening. The commander sat across from him in the wagon — the small space that served as his quarters, his study, his hospital room. The lamp's light was warm. The maps covered the surface between them.

"Three levels," Korvain said. His voice was quiet — the diminished volume that had become his permanent register, each word requiring the conscious effort that speech had become. "The outer ruins are accessible to anyone. Stone walls, collapsed sections, the archaeological remains of a building that was ancient when the current civilizations were young. That's where you'll establish the defensive perimeter."

"The inner sanctum is warded." He traced the map's notation — the symbolic markers that indicated the ward boundaries, the ancient defenses that the temple's designers had erected to protect the structure's deepest chambers. "Only a Sun-Blade bearer can pass. The wards are keyed to the weapon's dimensional signature — the same frequency that Solkren detected, the resonance that the blade shares with the relics and the barrier."

"The Heart Chamber." He pointed to the map's center — the circular notation that marked the temple's deepest room, the chamber where the Sunheart relic had been stored for three thousand years. "The deepest level. That's where the Sunheart rests."

"And the wards?" Itzil asked. "What exactly do they do?"

Korvain was quiet for a moment. The particular silence that preceded information that the speaker had been considering how to deliver — not withholding but packaging, the careful construction of words that would convey the essential meaning without the unnecessary detail that could distort it.

"The temple doesn't test combat capability," he said. "It tests the bearer's soul. Three chambers. Three fears. The temple will show you what you fear most. It will ask you if you're willing to face it."

"And if I'm not willing?"

"Then you don't leave." The statement was simple. The implication was final. "The temple's designers didn't create a test that could be failed and repeated. The test is pass or die. Face the fear or be consumed by it."

"And if I lie? If I pretend to face it?"

"The temple knows. The wards are keyed to the bearer's consciousness — the same dimensional resonance that connects the blade to the barrier. The temple doesn't read your words. It reads your soul. If you lie to it, it kills you."

The information was devastating in its simplicity. The trial was not about skill. Not about power. Not about the military capability that Itzil had spent months developing. The trial was about honesty — the particular, brutal honesty that required a person to confront the things they were most afraid of and to acknowledge them without denial or deflection.

Itzil absorbed the briefing. Her face was steady — the command mask maintaining the composure that the situation required. But Korvain could see beneath the mask — the student he had trained for six years, the person whose fears he knew better than anyone alive.

"There's something else," Korvain said. "Something I've been holding back."

Itzil's eyes sharpened. The particular focus that appeared when she detected withheld information — the commander's instinct for identifying the gaps between what was said and what was known.

"The Sun-Blade can be reforged," Korvain said. "But only if it's first broken."

The words landed with a weight that exceeded their simplicity. Itzil's hand moved to the blade at her hip — the unconscious gesture of a person reaching for the thing that defined them when the thing was threatened.

"Why would I break my own weapon?"

"You wouldn't. But if it breaks on its own — if the blade shatters not through your action but through the forces that act upon it — that means something different."

"What does it mean?"

"It means the blade has completed its current form. The weapon you carry is a fragment — a piece of what the original Sun-Blade was designed to be. The fragments that Solkren examined, the resonance he detected — those are the other pieces. The blade was never complete. It was always waiting to be broken so that it could be rebuilt."

"Rebuilt into what?"

"Into what it was designed to be. Not a weapon. A key. A dimensional key that can seal the barrier between worlds."

The revelation was enormous. The Sun-Blade — the weapon that Itzil had manifested, that had defined her identity as the bearer, that had been the symbol of the alliance's hope — was incomplete. A fraction of its intended form. The breaking that Korvain was describing was not destruction but transformation — the necessary shattering that preceded the reconstruction of something greater.

Korvain didn't explain further. The briefing had reached the limit of what he could share — the boundary between knowledge that would help Itzil and knowledge that would overwhelm her. She needed to enter the temple with enough understanding to face the trial and enough uncertainty to face it honestly.

"You'll understand when the time comes," he said.

Itzil stared at him. The student looking at the teacher — the person who had shaped her from potential into capability, who had carried the knowledge that she needed and had released it in portions that her development could absorb.

She wanted to argue. She wanted to demand the full explanation — the complete picture that her analytical mind craved. But she recognized the technique. Korvain had been doing this for six years — releasing information when she was ready to receive it, trusting that the readiness would come when the moment required it.

"You always knew more than you told me," she said.

"That's what teachers do. We know things our students don't need yet. And we trust them to know when they need them."

A cough interrupted. Wet, deep, agonizing — the particular sound that Korvain's lungs produced when the fluid accumulation exceeded the threshold that quiet breathing could manage. The cough racked his body — the frail frame shaking with the force that the compromised lungs demanded.

Neyla appeared at the wagon's entrance. The healer's turquoise light was already active — the diagnostic perception assessing Korvain's condition with the automatic attention that months of monitoring had produced.

Korvain waved her away. The gesture was weak — the hand that had once commanded training grounds and council chambers now barely able to lift from the blanket that covered him.

"Save your magic," he said. The rasp in his voice was worse — the cough having disrupted what little capacity his lungs had been maintaining. "Save it for the soldiers."

"You ARE my patient," Neyla said.

"I'm a patient you can't save. And you know it."

The exchange was familiar — the same conversation they had been having for weeks, the healer's refusal to accept the prognosis confronting the patient's refusal to consume resources that others needed more. The stalemate continued. Neyla's turquoise light remained active. Korvain's dismissal remained standing.

Itzil watched the exchange. The commander who had been receiving tactical intelligence about the temple trial was now watching the tactical reality of her mentor's decline — the two timelines converging, the race to the temple and the race against Korvain's body running simultaneously toward conclusions that were both approaching and both unavoidable.

He needed to last long enough. Long enough to see her through the temple. Long enough to deliver the final lessons that his knowledge contained. Long enough to be there when she needed him — because being there, as Miyako had taught, was the thing that mattered.

The wagon moved with the army. The maps covered the surface. The lamp burned low.

And the grandmaster — seventy-three years old, his body failing, his mind sharp, his purpose clear — settled into the blankets and began planning how to use the time he had left.

Every hour mattered. And the hours were running out.
