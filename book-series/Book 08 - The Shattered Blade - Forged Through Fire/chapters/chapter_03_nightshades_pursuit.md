Chapter 3 - NIGHTSHADE'S PURSUIT

Nightshade led the Dominion force south with the cold efficiency of a mechanism executing its design, and the Ashvanar brother burned beside her like a fire that refused to be contained.

The southern expedition was five hundred soldiers — a strike force rather than an army, the operational size that Nightshade preferred for missions that required speed over mass. The force was professional — Dominion veterans selected for endurance and discipline, the kind of soldiers who could maintain a double-time march through hostile terrain without the complaints and breakdowns that lesser troops produced.

The Ashvanar brother was the variable that Nightshade couldn't fully control. The surviving half of the sorcerer pair — Gravos, his name was, though Nightshade rarely used it — carried his dead sibling's memory like a weapon and his grief like a fuel source. The grief had been fermenting since Book 4 — the months between his brother's death and this moment converting raw loss into something volatile and dangerous.

He wanted revenge. The desire was simple, absolute, and tactically inconvenient. Gravos didn't care about the Sunheart relic. He didn't care about the Great Gate's activation timeline. He didn't care about Valdremor's strategic objectives or the empire's long-term plans. He cared about one thing: killing the people who had killed his brother.

Nightshade kept him in check. The spymaster's management technique was surgical — the particular combination of authority, manipulation, and implied threat that she deployed when a volatile asset needed direction rather than restraint.

"Your grief is useful," she told him during the march's evening halt. Her voice carried the flat, professional delivery that characterized everything she communicated — the tone that made every statement sound like an intelligence briefing rather than a conversation. "Your rage is not. Channel it or I'll channel it for you."

Gravos glared at her. The sorcerer's eyes carried the particular intensity of a person whose emotional state was permanently elevated — the volcanic energy of unprocessed grief maintaining a temperature that prevented rational assessment. He was dangerous. Not because of his power — though his power was considerable — but because his judgment was compromised by an emotion that he couldn't manage and wouldn't acknowledge.

"I'll kill them," he said. "The commander. The duelist who murdered my brother. All of them."

"You'll kill whoever I point you at, when I point you at them. That's the arrangement. Deviate from it and I'll report to Valdremor that you're a liability."

The threat was effective. Gravos feared Valdremor — the Architect's reputation for precise, emotionless elimination of liabilities having reached every corner of the Dominion's military apparatus. The fear didn't eliminate the rage. It contained it — the way a furnace contained fire, the structure directing the energy rather than preventing it.

Nightshade communicated with Valdremor via blood-mirror — the encrypted channel that her blood-magic provided, the communication medium that required no crystal relays and couldn't be intercepted by conventional intelligence methods. The blood-mirror was a pool of her own blood, contained in a silver basin, the surface reflecting not her face but Valdremor's — the Architect's image appearing in the crimson liquid with the particular, unsettling clarity that blood-magic produced.

Valdremor's instructions were precise. The Architect's voice carried through the blood-mirror with the controlled delivery that characterized everything he communicated — the flat, analytical tone that made every instruction sound like a mathematical proof rather than a command.

"Let the heroes reach the temple first," he said. "The wards will test the Sun-Blade bearer. If she fails, the wards kill her and you walk in unopposed. If she succeeds and retrieves the relic, she'll be weakened by the trial. You take it from her exhausted body."

"And if she succeeds and ISN'T weakened?" Nightshade asked. The question was professional — the spymaster's assessment of contingencies, the operational planning that required every scenario to be addressed.

"Then break her blade." Valdremor's crystal eye glinted in the blood-mirror's surface. "I've analyzed the Sun-Blade's magical signature from Amalura's copied knowledge. The blade has a core resonance — a dimensional frequency that maintains its structural integrity. Blood-magic, applied to that frequency, will corrode the blade from within. Like rust eating iron. The process is irreversible once initiated."

The technique was specific. Valdremor described it with the particular precision that his analytical mind applied to every mechanism — the frequency parameters, the blood-magic modulation required, the timing of application. The technique was not an attack on the blade's physical structure. It was an attack on its dimensional foundation — the magical substrate that gave the Sun-Blade its power and that, once corrupted, would cause the blade to consume itself.

Nightshade memorized the technique. The memorization was professional — the spymaster's trained capacity for absorbing and retaining complex information, the skill that had made her the Dominion's most effective intelligence operative.

She was excited. Not the cruel excitement of a person anticipating suffering — the professional excitement of a person who had identified the solution to a problem that had been constraining her operational capability. The Sun-Blade was the one weapon she feared. Not because of its power — Nightshade feared very little — but because of its unpredictability. The blade's dimensional resonance interfered with her blood-magic in ways she couldn't fully model. Every engagement with the Sun-Blade bearer carried risk that her other operations didn't.

Now she knew how to destroy it. The risk was eliminated. The variable was controlled. The mechanism was complete.

"The bearer's emotional state is compromised," Nightshade added. "The shadow master died days ago. The grandmaster is failing. She's grieving. Grieving people make mistakes."

"Factor the emotional state into your timing," Valdremor said. "Apply the corrosion when she's at maximum emotional and physical depletion — after the temple trial, during combat. The blade's defenses are linked to the bearer's psychological state. Grief weakens both."

The communication ended. The blood-mirror settled — the crimson surface returning to its natural reflective state, Valdremor's image dissolving into the liquid's depth.

Nightshade cleaned the mirror. She stored it in the padded case that she carried in her personal kit — the operational equipment that accompanied her on every mission, the tools of a trade that she had practiced for decades.

She looked south. The temple was four days away at current pace — five if Gravos's rage produced the discipline problems that she anticipated. The alliance would arrive first. The Sun-Blade bearer would enter the temple. The trial would test her.

And when the bearer emerged — weakened, exhausted, carrying the relic that the Dominion needed — Nightshade would be waiting. With the corrosion spell. With the blood-magic that would eat the Sun-Blade from within. With the professional precision that had made her the most dangerous person on the continent.

The Sun-Blade's time was ending. Nightshade could feel it — the professional instinct that decades of intelligence work had developed, the sense for operational trajectories that told her when a target was approaching the point of maximum vulnerability.

The blade would break. The bearer would fall. The relic would change hands.

And the Great Gate would open.

Nightshade smiled. The expression was rare — the spymaster's default being the flat, professional composure that revealed nothing. But this smile was earned. The plan was elegant. The timing was precise. The outcome was certain.

The mechanism was complete. All that remained was execution.
