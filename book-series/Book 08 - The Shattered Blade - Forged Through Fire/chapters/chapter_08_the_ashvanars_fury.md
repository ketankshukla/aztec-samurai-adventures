Chapter 8 - THE ASHVANAR'S FURY

The surviving Ashvanar brother hit the alliance's line like a storm made of grief and lightning, and Jagren was the one who stepped into his path.

Gravos attacked with the uncontrolled fury that months of fermenting rage produced — not tactical sorcery but raw, devastation-focused power. Lightning storms erupted from his hands — the electrical energy arcing across the battlefield in branching patterns that struck everything within range without discrimination. The ground shook — the seismic manipulation that Ashvanar sorcerers commanded, the earth-magic that converted stable terrain into a weapon. Cascading fire rolled across the southern approach — the thermal energy that Gravos channeled without precision, the heat signature of a person who was burning his power as fast as he could generate it.

The temple shook. The ancient stone — three thousand years old, designed to withstand dimensional forces that exceeded anything the current conflict produced — vibrated with the Ashvanar's assault. Rubble fell from compromised walls. Dust filled the air. The particular, grinding destruction that uncontrolled sorcery produced when it was deployed in an enclosed space.

Gravos screamed his dead brother's name with every spell. "KALTHOS!" The name was a weapon — the emotional payload that powered the sorcery, the grief converted into energy that exceeded what the sorcerer's training should have been able to produce. Grief was fuel. The Ashvanar tradition had always understood this — the emotional connection between practitioner and power, the relationship that made the Ashvanar brothers the Dominion's most volatile and most effective sorcerers.

Jagren intercepted. The duelist moved into the Ashvanar's path with the deliberate, professional precision that characterized everything he did in combat — not the dramatic entrance of a challenger seeking a duel but the controlled positioning of a defender occupying the space that the threat needed to pass through.

This was personal. Jagren had killed Kalthos — the other Ashvanar brother, the sorcerer who had died in Book 4. The kill had been necessary. The kill had been justified. The kill had been the kind of combat decision that warriors made when the alternative was allowing the enemy to destroy something worth protecting.

But the kill was also the reason that Gravos existed in his current state — the bereaved, rage-fueled, uncontrollable force that was tearing through the alliance's defensive perimeter. Jagren's action had created the consequence. The consequence was now attacking his friends.

He didn't flinch from the responsibility. The duelist who had been transformed by the war — from performer to professional, from glory-seeker to defender — accepted the personal dimension of the engagement without allowing it to alter his tactical approach.

Torvane deployed a mobile ward-disruptor — the engineering solution that the alliance had developed for sorcerer-class threats. The device was portable — a crystalline array mounted on a wheeled platform that Torvane could position within the ward-disruptor's effective radius. The device produced a localized field that dampened magical energy — reducing the sorcerer's output without eliminating it, the technological counter to magical superiority.

The ward-disruptor weakened Gravos's output by approximately forty percent. The lightning storms diminished — the arcs shorter, less powerful, the electrical energy reduced from lethal to merely dangerous. The seismic manipulation softened — the ground tremors decreasing from structural damage to tactical inconvenience. The fire cascades cooled — the thermal output reduced from incineration to burns.

Forty percent reduction. Enough to convert the Ashvanar's assault from overwhelming to manageable. Enough for a duelist to close to blade range.

Jagren attacked. The distance between the duelist's position and the sorcerer's — approximately thirty feet of fire-scarred, lightning-blasted terrain — was closed in a sprint that lasted four seconds. Four seconds during which Gravos launched three spells at the approaching fighter. Four seconds during which Jagren evaded, deflected, and absorbed the magical assault with the particular combination of agility and armor that his training had developed.

The duel began. Duelist versus sorcerer — the second encounter, the return match that Gravos had been craving since his brother's death. The first encounter had been decisive — Jagren had killed Kalthos in a fight that lasted ninety seconds. This encounter would not be as quick.

Gravos was stronger than his brother had been. The grief — the fuel that powered his sorcery — exceeded anything that normal emotional states could produce. The power output, even with the ward-disruptor's forty percent reduction, was formidable. His attacks were not precise — the rage that drove them prevented the calculation that precision required — but they were numerous and powerful and relentless.

Jagren countered with technique. The duelist's blade work was the antithesis of the sorcerer's approach — where Gravos was explosive and uncontrolled, Jagren was measured and precise. Where the sorcerer spent energy lavishly, the duelist conserved it ruthlessly. Where rage produced power, discipline produced efficiency.

The duel was vicious. Gravos screamed his brother's name — the continuous invocation that powered his spells and expressed his grief simultaneously. Jagren didn't respond with words. He responded with his blade — the silent, professional answer that action provided when words were inadequate.

The exchange lasted three minutes — an eternity in close combat, the sustained engagement that existed when both combatants were skilled enough to prevent the quick resolution that lesser fighters produced. Jagren took burns — the thermal energy that leaked through his defenses scorching his armor and heating the blade in his hand. Gravos took cuts — the duelist's blade finding the gaps in the sorcerer's magical defense, the steel reaching flesh that the magic couldn't fully protect.

Jagren found the opening. The Ashvanar's rage — the same fuel that powered his sorcery — produced the gap that discipline would have prevented. Gravos overextended — a lightning blast that required both hands and all his concentration, the offensive commitment that created the defensive vulnerability that Jagren had been waiting for.

The duelist's blade found the sorcerer's side. The cut was deep — the steel penetrating the magical defense that Gravos's concentration lapse had weakened, reaching the flesh beneath with the particular, decisive impact that combat wounds produced when they were placed by a professional.

Gravos staggered. The wound's pain broke the concentration that his sorcery required — the magical output stuttering, the spells faltering. The lightning died. The ground stopped shaking. The fire guttered.

He retreated. Not voluntarily — the wound's impact and the sorcery's interruption producing the involuntary withdrawal that injured fighters experienced when the body's survival instinct overrode the mind's aggressive intent. He stumbled behind Nightshade's lines — the Dominion formation absorbing him, the soldiers closing around the wounded sorcerer with the protective instinct that military units displayed when a valuable asset was injured.

Not dead. The wound was serious — deep enough to require medical attention, painful enough to prevent the concentration that sorcery demanded. But not fatal. Gravos would survive. He would heal. He would return.

But for this battle, he was neutralized. The Ashvanar's fury — the uncontrolled, devastating force that had been tearing through the alliance's defenses — was silenced. The particular quiet that followed the removal of a dominant threat — the battlefield's acoustic landscape changing as the source of the most dramatic sounds was eliminated.

Jagren stood in the space that the Ashvanar had occupied. The duelist was burned — the thermal damage visible on his armor, the skin beneath reddened by heat that the metal had transmitted. His blade was dark with blood — the Ashvanar's and his own, the combat's exchange visible on the weapon that had delivered it.

He didn't celebrate. He didn't perform. He turned to the next threat — the professional's response to the completion of one engagement and the beginning of the next. The wall that Itzil needed him to be, redirecting to the next section of wall that needed reinforcing.

The battle continued. The Ashvanar was down. Nightshade remained.

And the Sun-Blade's golden light — blazing from the temple entrance where Itzil stood — was about to attract the spymaster's attention in the way that the Architect had designed.
