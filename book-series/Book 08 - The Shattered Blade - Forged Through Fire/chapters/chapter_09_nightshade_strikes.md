Chapter 9 - NIGHTSHADE STRIKES

Nightshade had been waiting for this moment since Valdremor gave her the frequency, and the moment was perfect.

The spymaster observed the battle from the Dominion's rear line — the position that her operational philosophy demanded, the distance that allowed strategic assessment while maintaining the proximity that intervention required. She watched the Ashvanar's assault with professional detachment — Gravos's fury was useful as a distraction, his defeat by Jagren was anticipated, and the entire engagement served its purpose by drawing the alliance's attention to the southern approach while Nightshade prepared the real attack.

Itzil had emerged from the temple. The Sun-Blade bearer stood at the entrance to the inner sanctum — the golden light blazing from the weapon in her right hand, the Sunheart relic burning in her left. She was magnificent. The particular magnificence of a person who had passed a divine trial and was radiating the confidence that the passage provided.

She was also exhausted. The temple trial — the three fears, the Sunheart vision, the dimensional energy that the experience had required her consciousness to process — had depleted her. Not physically — the trial hadn't damaged her body. Psychologically. The emotional processing that confronting her deepest fears demanded had consumed the cognitive resources that sustained the Sun-Blade's full operation.

The blade's defenses were linked to the bearer's psychological state. Valdremor had identified this from Amalura's copied knowledge — the particular vulnerability that existed when the weapon's dimensional integrity depended on the wielder's emotional coherence. A bearer at full psychological capacity produced a blade at full defensive capability. A bearer whose psychology was compromised — by grief, by exhaustion, by the particular depletion that divine trials produced — generated a blade whose defenses were proportionally reduced.

Nightshade began the corrosion spell from a distance. The technique was subtle — not the dramatic, visible magic that Gravos deployed but the particular, surgical application that blood-magic specialized in. She channeled through the blood-mirrors that her soldiers carried — small reflective surfaces distributed across the battlefield, each one a node in the network that her blood-magic used to extend its reach.

The corrosion targeted the blade's core resonance — the dimensional frequency that maintained the Sun-Blade's structural integrity. The blood-magic didn't attack the blade's surface. It attacked the foundation — the dimensional substrate that gave the weapon its power. The corrosion was internal, invisible, the magical equivalent of rust eating iron from the inside out.

Itzil wouldn't feel it immediately. The blade's defenses would resist — the dimensional integrity fighting the corruption the way an immune system fought infection. But the defenses were compromised by the bearer's psychological depletion. The resistance was weaker than it should have been. The corrosion was progressing faster than it would have against a bearer at full capacity.

Nightshade also targeted Kaelen. The secondary attack — the two-pronged approach that Valdremor's plan specified. She remembered Kaelen's blood from Gravok's old wound — the blood-magic connection that persisted once established, the permanent link that allowed the practitioner to affect the target at distance.

She sent pain lancing through his scars. The old wounds — the injuries that Gravok's interrogation had produced in Book 3 — flared with the sudden, intense pain that blood-magic could generate in tissue it had previously touched. The pain was not random — it was calibrated to distract, to disrupt, to prevent the scout from performing the support role that his presence beside Itzil normally provided.

Kaelen staggered. The pain hit him mid-stride — the scout moving toward Itzil's position, the protective instinct that drove him toward the person he was committed to defending. The stagger was brief — his training and discipline converting the pain into a managed variable rather than a disabling condition. But the seconds that the stagger cost — the moments of disrupted attention and compromised movement — were seconds during which Itzil was unsupported.

Two-pronged attack. The blade corroding from within. The scout disabled by old wounds. The commander stripped of her weapon and her closest ally simultaneously.

Nightshade murmured the final syllable of the corrosion spell. The word was precise — the phonetic component that completed the blood-magic's activation sequence, the sound that released the corruption from its controlled state into its active form.

Across the battlefield, inside the Sun-Blade's golden light, something cracked.

Microscopic. Internal. The dimensional substrate that maintained the blade's structure — the foundation that three thousand years of accumulated bearer-energy had built — developed a flaw. The flaw was small — invisible to observation, undetectable by any sense except the particular, intimate awareness that existed between a bearer and a weapon.

The blade didn't notice. The golden light continued to blaze. The warmth continued to radiate. The weapon continued to function as if nothing had changed.

But the damage had begun. The corrosion was active. The flaw was growing. The dimensional foundation that sustained the Sun-Blade was being eaten from within by the blood-magic that Valdremor had designed and Nightshade had deployed.

The clock was ticking. Not the Starless Crown's clock — the blade's. The time between the corrosion's initiation and the blade's failure was finite. Hours. Maybe less. The blood-magic worked at the pace that dimensional corruption set — steady, irreversible, the progressive failure of a system whose foundation had been compromised.

Nightshade watched. The professional satisfaction that she had anticipated was present — the particular fulfillment of a plan's execution, the craftsman's pleasure in watching a mechanism perform as designed. The Sun-Blade was dying. The bearer didn't know it. The alliance didn't know it.

Only Nightshade knew. And knowing was her weapon.

She waited. Patient. Professional. The spymaster who had spent decades building the intelligence apparatus that made the Dominion's strategic decisions possible was now watching the most important operation of the war unfold with the particular patience that important operations required.

The blade would break. The bearer would fall. The relic would change hands.

The mechanism was executing. All that remained was time.
