Chapter 10 - THE BLADE FALTERS

Something was wrong with the Sun-Blade, and Itzil couldn't name it.

She fought through Dominion soldiers — the combat engagement that the temple's exit had thrust her into, the battle that had been raging while she completed the trial. The Sun-Blade blazed in her hand — the golden light cutting through the battlefield's chaos with the particular authority that the weapon's power provided. Each swing produced the devastating effect that the Sun-Blade's dimensional energy generated — the strikes that cut through armor, through magical defenses, through the Dominion's professional discipline with the particular, overwhelming force that no conventional weapon could match.

But something was wrong.

The blade was flickering. The golden light — which had been steady and constant since the manifestation, the reliable output that Itzil had come to depend on — was stuttering. Brief interruptions, microseconds of dimming that were almost imperceptible but that she could feel through the bond that connected bearer to weapon. The flickers were not the blade's normal energy fluctuation — the minor variations that combat demand produced. They were something else. Something internal. Something wrong.

She pushed harder. The blade responded — the golden light surging back to full intensity, the weapon's energy answering the bearer's will with the particular, powerful compliance that the bond produced. The response was strong. The blade was strong. Whatever the flickering was, the weapon's overall capability didn't seem diminished.

But each swing cost more energy than it should. The effort that the blade required — the will-to-power that the bearer provided and the weapon converted into dimensional force — was increasing. The efficiency was decreasing. The same output required more input. The exchange rate between Itzil's will and the blade's power was degrading.

Dark threads appeared in the golden light. Barely visible — thin lines of something that was not gold, something that interrupted the light's continuous warmth with the particular quality of corruption. The threads were internal — embedded in the blade's dimensional structure, the visual manifestation of the corrosion that Nightshade's blood-magic was producing.

Itzil didn't understand what was happening. The blade's behavior was unprecedented — nothing in her experience as bearer, nothing in Korvain's briefings, nothing in the accumulated knowledge of the Sun-Blade tradition described the phenomenon she was experiencing. The blade was weakening from within. The power that it had reliably provided since the manifestation was being consumed by something that was eating the weapon's foundation.

Amalura would know. The scholar whose knowledge encompassed the pre-Gate civilization's dimensional technology would have recognized the corrosion immediately — the blood-magic attack on the blade's core resonance, the technique that Valdremor had designed from the intelligence that Amalura's captured knowledge had provided. But Amalura was in a detention tower four hundred miles north. Her knowledge was unavailable. The person who could have explained what was happening and how to stop it was the person the alliance hadn't been able to rescue.

Korvain might know. The grandmaster's understanding of the Sun-Blade tradition was deep — the accumulated knowledge of decades of study and practice. But Korvain was in the rear — on his stretcher in the wagon, too frail to reach the battlefield, his body too weak to survive the journey from the camp to the ruins.

Itzil fought on. The blade flickered. The dark threads spread. The power degraded.

Nightshade appeared at the front line. The spymaster emerged from the Dominion's formation with the particular, controlled authority of a person who owned every space they occupied — the blood-magic deflecting the attacks that allied soldiers directed at her, the crimson energy creating a barrier that turned blades and arrows and the conventional weapons that the alliance's infantry wielded.

She walked through the battle. Not fighting — walking. The distinction was deliberate. Nightshade wanted the alliance to see her — to observe the casual, unhurried approach that communicated supreme confidence. She wanted Itzil to see her — to understand that the person approaching was not a soldier engaging in combat but a professional executing a plan.

She faced Itzil across a clearing — the open space that the battle had created, the particular gap that formed when two forces withdrew from a section of the battlefield to allow their commanders to engage. The clearing was approximately thirty feet across. The distance between the two women was the distance between everything the alliance hoped for and everything the Dominion intended.

"Hello again, Sun-Blade bearer," Nightshade said. Her voice carried the flat, professional delivery that was her signature — the tone that made every statement sound like an intelligence briefing. "I've been looking forward to this."

Itzil raised the Sun-Blade. The golden light blazed — brighter than the flickering had suggested, the weapon's energy surging in response to the threat that Nightshade represented. The dark threads were visible now — thin lines of corruption running through the golden light like veins through marble.

Nightshade saw the threads. The professional satisfaction was invisible — the spymaster's control preventing any readable expression. But she knew. The corrosion was working. The blade was dying.

They charged each other. Itzil — Sun-Blade forward, the bearer's combat technique deployed at maximum intensity. Nightshade — blood-magic barriers active, the crimson energy forming the defensive and offensive configuration that her decades of practice had perfected.

The Sun-Blade met Nightshade's blood-barrier. The impact was enormous — the collision of dimensional energy and blood-magic producing a shockwave that radiated outward from the point of contact and staggered every soldier within fifty feet. The ground cracked. The air compressed. The particular, devastating force that two masters-level practitioners produced when they engaged at full power.

And inside the blade, the cracks spread. The impact's force — the enormous energy that the collision demanded — accelerated the corrosion. The dimensional foundation that was being eaten from within was stressed by the combat demand from without. The cracks that had been microscopic became visible. The dark threads that had been thin became broader.

The blade was dying. And Itzil could feel it now — the particular, intimate awareness that existed between bearer and weapon, the bond that transmitted the blade's state to the bearer's consciousness with the fidelity of a nervous system transmitting pain.

The Sun-Blade was in distress. The weapon that had been her companion, her symbol, her identity — the golden light that defined who she was — was failing.

And the duel with Nightshade was just beginning.
