Chapter 20 - VALDREMOR'S TRANSMISSION

Valdremor received Nightshade's report in his study and the numbers confirmed what his analysis had predicted.

The Architect sat at his desk — the crystalline surface that served as both workspace and computation medium, the material responding to his touch with the analytical displays that his dimensional engineering required. The study was quiet — the controlled environment that Valdremor maintained, the particular silence that his concentration demanded and that the palace's architecture provided.

Nightshade's report arrived through the blood-mirror network — the encrypted transmission that the spymaster's magic provided, the intelligence product delivered with the clinical precision that characterized all her communications.

The Sun-Blade is destroyed. Corrosion spell executed as designed. Blade shattered during engagement with bearer. Fragment secured — contains trace relic energy. Sun-Blade bearer survived but is disarmed. Grandmaster died overnight — natural causes, declining health. Alliance army depleted, morale compromised. Sunheart relic remains in bearer's possession.

Valdremor processed the report with the analytical attention that he applied to every intelligence product. The variables were evaluated. The implications were calculated. The strategic picture was updated.

He was satisfied. The satisfaction was not emotional — the Architect's responses were analytical rather than affective, the professional assessment that the plan's execution had produced the intended result. The Sun-Blade — the largest threat to the Dominion's strategic objectives — was neutralized. The bearer was disarmed. The grandmaster was dead. The alliance's military capability was reduced to a level that conventional Dominion forces could overcome.

The Sunheart relic remained in alliance hands. This was a variable that Nightshade's report flagged — the relic that the Dominion needed was still with the enemy. But Valdremor's analysis had already produced the solution.

He didn't need the Sunheart.

The realization had emerged from his study of Amalura's copied knowledge — the dimensional engineering data that the scholar's consciousness had contained and that Valdremor's interrogation had extracted. The Great Gate's activation required energy — the dimensional force that powered the portal's opening. The sacred relics were the original design's energy source — the concentrated dimensional energy that the pre-Gate civilization had stored in physical objects.

But the relics were not the only energy source. The ash-oath system — the consciousness-harvesting mechanism that Helisar had developed — produced dimensional energy as a byproduct. Each enslaved consciousness contributed a unit of energy to the Gate's reservoir. The contribution was smaller than what a relic provided — orders of magnitude smaller. But the quantity compensated for the quality. Thousands of enslaved consciousnesses, each contributing a small amount, produced a total that approached the relic's output.

It was less elegant. The original design — relics as energy source, the Sun-Blade as dimensional key — was the refined, precise mechanism that the pre-Gate civilization had created. The substitute — ash-oath energy, brute-forced through the Gate's activation sequence — was crude. Wasteful. The particular inelegance that existed when a sophisticated design was forced to accept an inferior input.

But sufficient. The mathematics confirmed it. The ash-oath energy, accumulated at the current rate, would reach the threshold for Gate activation within weeks. The Sunheart relic was unnecessary. The original design's elegant mechanism had been replaced by the Dominion's industrial-scale alternative.

Valdremor accelerated the Great Gate preparations. The orders were dispatched through the mirror-network — the communication infrastructure that connected the Dominion's administrative centers. Every ash-oath facility was to increase production. Every occupied territory was to expand the conversion program. The energy reservoir was to be filled at maximum rate.

He sent a message to all kingdoms. The transmission was broadcast — not encrypted, not targeted, the deliberate, public communication that was designed to be received by every government, every military command, every leader on the continent.

"Surrender now, and you will be spared what comes through the Gate. This is not a threat. It is a kindness I will only offer once."

The ultimatum was calculated. The timing — delivered after the Sun-Blade's destruction, after the alliance's military setback — was designed to maximize the psychological impact. The content — the explicit reference to "what comes through the Gate" — was designed to communicate that Valdremor understood what was on the other side and was choosing to open it anyway.

The Starless Crown pulsed. The dimensional distortion that hung above the Dominion's capital responded to the accelerated energy flow — the barrier weakening faster, the void growing, the stars being consumed at a rate that exceeded the previous progression. The Crown was at approximately sixty percent. The acceleration was pushing it toward sixty-five.

Something on the other side of reality heard. The barrier — the dimensional wall that separated the human world from Vastrix's domain — vibrated with the particular frequency that indicated pressure from the other side. Vastrix stirred. The ocean of hunger — patient, consuming, vast — detected the barrier's weakening and pressed harder.

The sky above the Dominion capital cracked.

The fissure was visible — a line of red light splitting the sky above the palace, the dimensional distortion producing a visual manifestation that everyone in the capital could see. The crack was not a portal — not the controlled opening that the Great Gate was designed to produce. It was a tear — the uncontrolled rupture that occurred when dimensional stress exceeded the barrier's capacity to contain it.

Red light bled through the gap. The light was wrong — not the warmth of sunlight or the coldness of starlight but something else, the particular quality of illumination that existed in Vastrix's domain and that was now leaking into the human world through the fissure that the accelerated energy flow had produced.

Valdremor watched the fissure from his study window. The crystal eye — the prosthetic that replaced the eye he had sacrificed for dimensional sight — registered the fissure's properties with the analytical precision that the device provided. The data was clear: the fissure was a stress fracture. The barrier was failing ahead of schedule. The accelerated energy flow was producing uncontrolled results.

For the first time: a flicker of doubt. The particular, microsecond hesitation that existed when an analytical mind encountered data that contradicted its model. The Gate was supposed to open in a controlled sequence — the precise, managed activation that Valdremor's engineering had designed. The fissure was not controlled. The fissure was the barrier breaking under pressure that exceeded the design parameters.

"Have I gone too far?" The thought was brief. The doubt was momentary. The analytical mind — the mechanism that had built the Gate and designed the corrosion spell and extracted knowledge from Amalura — evaluated the doubt and dismissed it. The acceleration was necessary. The timeline was compressing. The alliance's remaining capability — diminished but not eliminated — required the Gate's opening to proceed at maximum speed.

He pushed the thought aside. The doubt was filed — the way all variables were filed, assessed, stored for later evaluation if the assessment's parameters changed. The doubt was not resolved. It was contained.

The sky cracked. The red light bled through. Vastrix pressed against the barrier with the increased pressure that the weakening provided.

And somewhere in the palace's depths, Serenthar wept. The demon-bound seer — who could see the futures converging, who could feel the pressure of what was coming — wept louder than she ever had. Because she could see the fissure not just in the sky but in the timeline — the crack in the plan that would eventually shatter the plan the way the corrosion spell had shattered the blade.

The mechanism was executing. The doubt was contained. The sky was breaking.

And the hunger on the other side was growing.
