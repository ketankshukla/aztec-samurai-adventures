Chapter 22 - PLANNING ACT III

Kaelen spread the maps across the command table and the next phase of the war took shape in the space between intelligence and imagination.

The planning session was the most important strategic meeting since the alliance's formation — the moment when the war's trajectory shifted from reactive to proactive, from surviving the Dominion's assaults to executing the operations that would determine the conflict's outcome. Itzil sat at the table's center. Kaelen stood beside her — the scout's position, the proximity that was now both professional and personal.

The team was present. All of them — the surviving heroes, the military advisors, the key staff who contributed to the alliance's strategic decisions. The faces around the table were tired but focused — the particular quality that existed when people who had been through the worst discovered that the worst hadn't killed them and that the work of recovery required the same determination that the work of survival had demanded.

Kaelen mapped the next phase with the analytical precision that his intelligence training provided. The strategic objectives were four — the interconnected goals that the war's endgame required.

"One: rescue Amalura." The first objective — the operation that would recover the scholar whose knowledge was essential to every subsequent objective. "She's in the Dominion's detention tower. I've been tracking the location since Book 6 via Rainara's water-sense. The tower sits on a river — unwarded, because the Dominion doesn't consider water a threat vector. Rainara can get us in through the river. The tower's guard rotation, internal layout, and security protocols are mapped."

"Two: reforge the blade." The second objective — the transformation that Korvain had described and that Solkren's discovery suggested was possible. "If possible. The fragments still resonate — Solkren can confirm this. Korvain said the blade was designed to break and be reforged into something greater. Amalura's knowledge may contain the technique."

"Three: find a way to close or disrupt the Great Gate." The third objective — the strategic goal that prevented the Dominion from achieving its endgame. "The Gate's activation requires energy. The ash-oath system provides that energy. Disrupting the ash-oath network disrupts the Gate. Neyla's reversal technique is the key — if we can scale it, we can drain the Gate's power source."

"Four: defeat Vastrix before it fully manifests." The fourth objective — the existential threat that everything else served. "The barrier is weakening. The Crown is growing. Something is pressing through from the other side. Even if we close the Gate, we need to seal the barrier. That requires the reforged blade — the dimensional key that the Sun-Blade was designed to become."

Kaelen paused. The four objectives hung in the air — the interconnected chain of goals that, if achieved, would save the world, and that, if any single link failed, would result in the world's destruction.

"Any one of these is nearly impossible," he said. The honest assessment that his analytical mind produced — the scout's refusal to soften the reality that the data presented. "All four together is insane."

"Then we'd better be fast," Itzil said.

They planned the Amalura rescue in detail. The operation was the first link in the chain — the objective that had to be achieved before the others could be attempted. Kaelen presented the intelligence that months of tracking had accumulated.

The detention tower was in the Dominion's northern territory — approximately four hundred miles from the army's current position. The tower sat on a river — the geographical feature that Rainara's water-sense had used to track Amalura's location. The river was unwarded — the Dominion's security focused on conventional approaches, the architects not considering water as a viable infiltration vector.

The guard rotation was mapped. Rainara's water-sense — the expanded perception that detected human bodies through their water content — had provided the patrol patterns that the tower's security maintained. The rotation was regular — the predictable schedule that military discipline produced and that intelligence exploitation targeted.

The internal layout was partially known. Rainara could sense the tower's occupants — the number and approximate position of guards, prisoners, and administrative staff. The specific layout — corridors, doors, security checkpoints — was inferred from the movement patterns that the water-sense detected.

The approach route was through the river. Rainara could transport a small team — four or five people — through the waterway that connected the river to the tower's foundation. The approach was unconventional. The Dominion wouldn't expect it. The element of surprise was the operation's primary advantage.

Neyla reported on her ash-oath reversal capability. The healer's technique — refined through months of practice and the Kanezawa operation — was now reliable. She could break oaths consistently. The scaling challenge remained — individual reversals were effective but slow. The technique could be taught to other healers, but the training time exceeded the timeline that the Gate's acceleration imposed.

"If we can free enough slaves, the Gate's power source drains," Neyla said. "Every reversed oath reduces the energy flowing to the Gate. The question is rate — can we reverse oaths faster than the Dominion can create them?"

"Not one at a time," Kaelen said. "We need the anchor-destruction technique that Miyako used at Kanezawa. Destroy the central anchors and the oaths weaken. Then Neyla's technique can finish them."

"How many anchors?" Itzil asked.

"Eleven. Eleven cities with active ash-oath facilities. Eleven anchors. Destroy them all and the Gate's energy source collapses."

"Eleven simultaneous operations," Zariel said. The diplomat's assessment was immediate — the strategic mind evaluating the operational requirement. "We don't have the forces for that."

"We don't need forces. We need the right people in the right places at the right time." Kaelen looked at Itzil. "The rescue first. Amalura's knowledge tells us how to reforge the blade. The reforged blade gives us the power to tackle the anchors and the Gate."

The plan took shape. Audacious. Multi-layered. Requiring everything the alliance had — every person, every skill, every resource that the war had left them. The plan was not a guaranteed path to victory. It was a possible path to survival. The distinction was the honest assessment that Itzil's new leadership style provided — the willingness to acknowledge uncertainty while choosing action.

"When do we move?" Itzil asked.

"Yesterday," Kaelen said. The scout's characteristic humor — rare, dry, deployed at the moments when humor was most needed. "But tomorrow works too."

The council ended. The plan was set. The army would move north — toward the detention tower, toward Amalura, toward the first link in the chain that connected the present to the future.

The team dispersed. Each person to their role — the preparations that the rescue operation demanded, the logistics and intelligence and tactical planning that converted a strategic decision into an executable plan.

Itzil stood at the command table. The maps spread before her — the strategic picture that the war had drawn, the geography of conflict and possibility and the thin, fragile line between survival and extinction.

She looked at the maps. She looked at the plan. She looked at the future that the plan described — uncertain, dangerous, the particular future that existed when impossible things were attempted by people who refused to accept impossibility.

"All three?" Kaelen had asked.

All four, actually. Rescue. Reforge. Close. Defeat.

The chain was long. The links were fragile. The probability was low.

But the probability was not zero. And not-zero was enough for people who didn't do possible things.
