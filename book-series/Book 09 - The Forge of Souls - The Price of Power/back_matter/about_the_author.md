# About the Author

**Ketan Shukla** is the author of the *Aztec Samurai Adventures* series and multiple non-fiction titles. He writes stories about people who give pieces of themselves to each other — and discover that what they build together is greater than what they could ever build alone.

He lives with his wife Nimisha and believes that the quiet ones — the armorers, the builders, the people who work with their hands while others stand in the light — are the ones who hold the world together.

*Aztec Samurai Adventures* is his first fiction series.
