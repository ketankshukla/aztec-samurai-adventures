# Author's Note

Thank you for reading *The Forge of Souls*.

This book is about Solkren. The quiet man. The armorer no one watched. The person who spent eight books in the background — fixing weapons, maintaining equipment, doing the invisible work that kept everything functional while the heroes fought and the commanders led and the world burned around him.

And then, when everything depended on it, he stepped to the center of the forge and channeled nine people's souls through his hands and nearly died creating the most powerful weapon the world had ever seen.

"I just listened to the metal."

That's the line that defines this book. Not a battle cry. Not a heroic declaration. A craftsman explaining his method. The quiet statement of a person who understood that the work was never about him — it was about the material, the process, the conversation between maker and made.

The soul-forge sequence — nine contributions, each one a person giving their defining memory to the blade — was the most emotionally complex thing I've written in this series. Each contribution is a miniature character study. Itzil gives her need for a mentor. Kaelen gives his fear of belonging. Jagren gives his hunger for glory. Neyla gives her crushing grief. And each one, after giving, discovers they're lighter. Better. Not healed — but better.

Amalura's return was a joy to write. Three months in a cell, and she spent the entire time planting bombs in Valdremor's stolen knowledge. "Child, I have been fighting for eighty years. A cell doesn't change that." That's the most Amalura sentence in the series.

Act III has begun. The blade is reforged. The scholar is rescued. Vastrix has spoken. The army is charging.

Three books remain. The Mirror Queen. Crown of Stars. The Sun That Never Sets.

Hold on tight.

With gratitude,
Ketan Shukla
