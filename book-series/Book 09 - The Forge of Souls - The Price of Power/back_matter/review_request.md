# A Quick Favor

If Solkren's forge made you hold your breath — if "I just listened to the metal" hit you the way it hit me — would you consider leaving a review on Amazon?

Reviews help other readers find the series. And they help me keep writing stories about the quiet ones who hold the world together.

Even a single sentence:

> *"Nine souls. One blade. I wasn't ready."*

Thank you for reading. The final war has begun. Three books remain.
