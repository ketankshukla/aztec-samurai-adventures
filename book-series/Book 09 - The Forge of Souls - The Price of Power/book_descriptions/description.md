# Book Description — Aztec Samurai Adventures Book 9: The Forge of Souls - The Price of Power

## Subtitle: The Price of Power

---

<b>Nine heroes. Nine memories. One blade. The quiet man no one watched is about to save the world.</b>

<p>The Sun-Blade is shattered. But the armorer has been studying the fragments — and the fragments have been talking back. They're not dead. They're dormant. Waiting to be reforged into something greater.</p>

<p>The price? Each hero must give a piece of their soul.</p>

<p><b>In this book:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>An armorer channels nine people's souls through his hands — and nearly dies creating the most powerful weapon in the world</li>
<li>A parallel rescue mission infiltrates the Dominion's most secure prison through its unwarded river</li>
<li>A scholar reveals the bombs she planted in the villain's stolen knowledge: "He stole my data. But he couldn't steal my judgment."</li>
<li>An entity the size of a continent speaks to the world: "I SEE YOU. ALL OF YOU. AND I AM HUNGRY."</li>
<li>A blade reforged from nine colors blazes against a bleeding sky</li>
<li>The final charge begins</li>
</ul>

<p><i>The Forge of Souls</i> opens Act III with the series' most emotionally complex sequence — nine soul-contributions, each one a character study in what people are willing to give up to protect each other. The blade that emerges is not one person's weapon. It's everyone's.</p>

<p>For fans of <i>The Way of Kings</i>, <i>The Name of the Wind</i>, and stories where the quiet person in the background turns out to be the one who matters most — a book about what happens when you listen to the metal.</p>

<p><i>"I just listened to the metal."</i></p>

<p><b>Book 9 of 12 in the <i>Aztec Samurai Adventures</i> series. The first book of Act III: The Reckoning. From Ketan Shukla, published by Metronagon.</b></p>
