# Chapter 1 Summary — THE ARMORER'S SECRET

**POV:** Solkren

Solkren has been studying blade fragments in secret for weeks. They still resonate — dormant, not dead. Ancient texts reveal: the First Bearer was a weaponsmith, not a warrior. The blade was always meant to break and be reforged.

Three requirements: original fragments, Sunheart relic, and "the fire of many" — soul-contributions from each hero. The reforged blade won't be one person's weapon. It will be everyone's.

**Key Events:** Fragment resonance confirmed, reforging requirements discovered, soul-contribution concept identified.

**Cliffhanger:** Solkren brings findings to Itzil. "You can reforge it?" "I can. But the cost isn't metal or magic. It's... personal."
