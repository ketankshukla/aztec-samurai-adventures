# Chapter 2 Summary — THE PROPOSAL

**POV:** Itzil

Solkren explains the soul-forge to the full team. Each hero gives a defining memory — the emotional weight transfers to the blade. "Not take. Share." Risk for contributors: emotional discomfort. Risk for Solkren: channeling nine souls could kill him.

Itzil won't order it — must be voluntary. Jagren volunteers first (surprising everyone). Then Neyla, Rainara, Kaelen, Skyren, Zariel, Torvane. All nine agree.

**Key Events:** Soul-forge explained, risks outlined, all nine heroes volunteer, parallel operations planned.

**Cliffhanger:** Nine agreements. The forge needs three days. The rescue team departs before the forging.
