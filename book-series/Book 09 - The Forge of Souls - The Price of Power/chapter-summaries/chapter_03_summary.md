# Chapter 3 Summary — PARALLEL MISSION: THE RESCUE

**POV:** Kaelen

Kaelen leads the rescue team — himself, Jagren, Rainara — into enemy territory. Shadow-fade technique extending to eight seconds. Rainara masks their trail by manipulating moisture.

They reach the detention tower: black stone spire on a river. Heavy guard, blood-mirror surveillance, anti-magic wards. But the river approach is unwarded. "This is going to be fun." "Your definition of fun is terrible."

**Key Events:** Rescue team departs, enemy territory traversed, tower perimeter reached, vulnerabilities identified.

**Cliffhanger:** Twenty-four hours of observation. Then the infiltration begins.
