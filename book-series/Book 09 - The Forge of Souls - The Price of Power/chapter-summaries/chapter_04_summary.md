# Chapter 4 Summary — THE FORGE BEGINS

**POV:** Solkren

Solkren transforms a volcanic cave into the soul-forge workshop. Fragments arranged in crystalline pattern. Sunheart suspended above. The forge design matches ancient texts — rebuilt from memory.

He's terrified. The quiet one. The invisible one. Now everything depends on his hands. He lights the forge. Volcanic vents flare. Fragments begin to glow — faint gold, like embers. "I just listen to the metal." The metal listens back.

**Key Events:** Forge cave prepared, fragment array arranged, Sunheart positioned, forge lit, fragments activate.

**Cliffhanger:** The forge is ready. Now he needs the souls.
