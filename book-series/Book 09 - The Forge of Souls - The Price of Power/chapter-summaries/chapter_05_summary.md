# Chapter 5 Summary — ITZIL'S MEMORY

**POV:** Itzil

First soul-contribution. Itzil's defining memory: Korvain's last lesson — "Now you know you don't need it." She gives up her need for a mentor. Not the love — the dependency.

A golden thread connects her to the fragments. The metal drinks it in. She gasps — the memory is still there but lighter. The crushing weight of needing Korvain's approval is in the blade now. "One."

**Key Events:** First soul-contribution, Korvain's lesson as defining memory, dependency transferred, lightness experienced.

**Cliffhanger:** One thread connected. Eight more to go.
