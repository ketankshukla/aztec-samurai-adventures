# Chapter 6 Summary — KAELEN'S MEMORY / THE INFILTRATION

**POV:** Kaelen

Split chapter. Kaelen contributes remotely via Rainara's water-link while infiltrating the tower. His memory: the night his scout unit died. Sitting alone in the dark. The vow to never let anyone close again. He gives up his fear of belonging.

Simultaneously, the rescue breaches the outer perimeter. Rainara floods the moat. Jagren engages gate guards. Kaelen shadow-steps inside. "Two."

**Key Events:** Remote soul-contribution, fear of belonging transferred, tower infiltration begun, moat flooded.

**Cliffhanger:** The golden thread pulses across four hundred miles. He pushes deeper into the tower.
