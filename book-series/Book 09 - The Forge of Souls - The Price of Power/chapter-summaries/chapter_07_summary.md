# Chapter 7 Summary — JAGREN'S MEMORY

**POV:** Jagren

Jagren contributes while fighting gate guards. His memory: the arena. The roar of the crowd. The perfect strike. The glory. He gives up his need to be seen. Keeps the lesson — the dying boy at Fortress Ashfall when glory became horror. The blade gets the need; he keeps the lesson.

No flourishes. No performance. Just protection. "Three." Path is clear.

**Key Events:** Third soul-contribution during combat, need for glory transferred, arena memory given, protective fighting.

**Cliffhanger:** Three down. Jagren signals Kaelen: path is clear.
