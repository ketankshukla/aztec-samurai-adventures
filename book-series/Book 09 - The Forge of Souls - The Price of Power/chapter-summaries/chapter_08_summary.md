# Chapter 8 Summary — NEYLA'S MEMORY

**POV:** Neyla

Neyla contributes at the forge. Her memory: her family — the last time she saw them before the ash-oaths took them. Mother's face. Father's hands. Sister's laugh. She gives up her crushing grief. Not the love — the paralyzing weight.

The turquoise light weeps with her. When it's done, she feels lighter. "Are you all right?" "Better. Actually... better."

**Key Events:** Fourth soul-contribution, family grief transferred, turquoise light weeps, unexpected relief experienced.

**Cliffhanger:** "Four." The healer who heals others has, through the forge, been healed herself.
