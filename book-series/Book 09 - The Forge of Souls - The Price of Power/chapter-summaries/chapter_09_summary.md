# Chapter 9 Summary — RAINARA, SKYREN, ZARIEL

**POV:** Solkren

Three rapid contributions as the forge builds momentum. Rainara gives her need for vengeance — fierce protectiveness remains without the poison. Skyren gives her need to escape — the choice to land remains. Zariel gives his need for the right answer — willingness to say "I don't know" remains.

Fragments flowing together — molten gold and starlight. Solkren's hands shake. Seven contributions through one person. He grits his teeth and holds. "Seven."

**Key Events:** Three contributions in rapid succession, forge momentum building, fragments merging, Solkren straining.

**Cliffhanger:** Liquid light in the form of a weapon. Not yet solid. Two more to go.
