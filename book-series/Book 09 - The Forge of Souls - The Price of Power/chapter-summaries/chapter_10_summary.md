# Chapter 10 Summary — TORVANE'S MEMORY

**POV:** Torvane

Torvane gives his need to control — the compulsion to engineer every outcome. What remains: willingness to build without guarantees. "It's beautiful." "It's not beautiful yet. It's honest. That's different."

"Eight." One more — Solkren himself. He must contribute while simultaneously controlling the forge. No one has ever done this.

**Key Events:** Eighth contribution, control compulsion transferred, blade nearly complete, Solkren's impossible dual task ahead.

**Cliffhanger:** The armorer looks at his hands. The hands that must now do two things at once — or die trying.
