# Chapter 11 Summary — THE ARMORER'S SACRIFICE

**POV:** Solkren

The final contribution nearly kills him. Solkren gives his invisibility — the safety of being no one — while controlling the forge simultaneously. Split consciousness. All nine threads blaze. The forge SURGES. The Sunheart cracks. The metal screams.

His hands burn. His mind tears. But he holds. In his hands: a blade. Golden with nine colored threads. Blue, red, green, silver, white, gold, bronze, iron-grey. At the core: Itzil's golden light binding them all. "Nine."

**Key Events:** Ninth contribution while controlling forge, near-fatal surge, Sunheart exhausted, blade completed with nine-colored threads.

**Cliffhanger:** The blade is complete. The armorer who no one watched just saved the world — quietly, with his hands.
