# Chapter 12 Summary — FINDING AMALURA

**POV:** Kaelen

Inside the tower. Kaelen navigates using Rainara's water-sense. Finds Amalura sitting upright, alert, unsurprised. "Took you long enough." She's thinner but her mind is a fortress.

Revelation: "Valdremor copied my knowledge. But I gave him errors." Corrosion technique won't work on reforged blade. Gate energy calculation 15% too low. Relic location incorrect. "Can you walk?" "I can do more than walk. Give me a weapon."

**Key Events:** Amalura found, cell breached, planted errors revealed, scholar armed and ready.

**Cliffhanger:** She holds the guard's sword like she means it. Three months of saved energy — now deployed.
