# Chapter 13 Summary — THE EXTRACTION

**POV:** Jagren

Rescue team extracts Amalura. Jagren clears the exit — disciplined fury, no flourishes. Rainara floods corridors behind them, disrupts blood-wards by diluting blood-magic with water. Portcullis gates jammed via hydraulic manipulation.

Amalura refuses to slow them down despite three months' captivity. They breach the outer wall. Freedom. "Run. Don't stop." They run.

**Key Events:** Tower extraction, Jagren's rearguard fighting, Rainara's water vs. blood-magic, blood-ward dilution, outer wall breached.

**Cliffhanger:** The open night. Freedom. Pursuit organizing behind them.
