# Chapter 15 Summary — THE NEW BLADE

**POV:** Itzil

Solkren presents the reforged blade. Stunning — longer, more refined, nine colored threads woven through golden metal. When Itzil takes it, she FEELS everyone. Kaelen's sharpness. Jagren's discipline. Neyla's compassion. Every soul-thread tangible.

It's heavier emotionally — carries nine souls. It resonates, not just cuts. "Thank you." Solkren: "It's what I do." The light fills the cave. They are no longer a team. They are a weapon. A family.

**Key Events:** Blade presented, nine-thread sensations experienced, resonance effect discovered, team transformed into unified weapon.

**Cliffhanger:** Nine souls. One weapon. The forge of souls complete.
