# Chapter 16 Summary — AMALURA RETURNS

**POV:** Amalura

Amalura reunites with the alliance. Immediately asks about Korvain. The silence tells her. "When?" "Three weeks ago. In his sleep." "Good. He earned rest." She doesn't cry — not in front of anyone.

Debriefs: every error planted in Valdremor's knowledge. Serenthar visited her in captivity — prophesied "an armorer no one watches." Examines the reforged blade: "He took everything I know. But he couldn't take what I understand."

**Key Events:** Emotional reunion, Korvain's death learned, planted errors detailed, Serenthar's prophecy fulfilled, blade examined.

**Cliffhanger:** The alliance is complete. Every piece in place. The endgame can begin.
