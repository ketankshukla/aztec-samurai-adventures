# Chapter 17 Summary — VALDREMOR'S ANGER

**POV:** Valdremor (Villain)

Valdremor receives news: Amalura escaped AND blade reforged. His two greatest victories undone. For the first time, he loses composure — goes very, very still. Crystal eye blazes.

He can't replicate the soul-forge (requires willing sacrifice — antithetical to the Dominion). Decision: overwhelm the blade. "Burn them all. Every reserve. Open the Gate." Maximum-rate burn. The sky tears wider. Red light floods the clouds.

**Key Events:** Valdremor loses composure, soul-forge unreplicable, maximum burn ordered, Gate acceleration, sky tears wider.

**Cliffhanger:** The mechanism is executing. The desperation is driving it. Vastrix presses harder.
