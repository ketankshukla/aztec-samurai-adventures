# Chapter 18 Summary — VASTRIX SPEAKS

**POV:** Itzil

The entire continent hears it — not with ears, with minds. "I SEE YOU. ALL OF YOU. AND I AM HUNGRY." Soldiers drop to their knees. Children cry. Animals bolt.

The reforged blade pushes back — nine soul-threads blazing defensively. Amalura: "The Gate is partially open. This is just its voice." Itzil: "If that's just its VOICE, what happens when it gets through?" Amalura: "Everything ends."

**Key Events:** Vastrix's psychic projection worldwide, blade's defensive response, scale of threat revealed, "everything ends."

**Cliffhanger:** They've been seen. They've been measured. Now they have to march toward it.
