# Chapter 19 Summary — THE STRATEGIC PICTURE

**POV:** Kaelen

Full war council. Crown at 75%. Gate partially open. Valdremor burning reserves. Kaelen maps the endgame: march on capital, free ash-oath slaves, defeat Dominion army, confront Vastrix, close the Gate.

Method for closing the Gate unknown. Amalura: "Serenthar might know. She prophesied the armorer. If she was right about that..." Serenthar is inside the Dominion capital. Reaching her requires the offensive.

**Key Events:** Five strategic objectives mapped, Amalura's planted errors as weapons, Serenthar as potential source for Gate-closing technique.

**Cliffhanger:** "Any one is nearly impossible. All five together is—" "Is what we're going to do."
