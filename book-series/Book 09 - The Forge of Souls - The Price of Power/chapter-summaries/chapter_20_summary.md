# Chapter 20 Summary — THE MARCH BEGINS

**POV:** Itzil

The alliance mobilizes everything. Itzil addresses the army: "Some of us won't come back. But if we don't march, NO ONE comes back. So we march." The army moves north toward the Dominion capital.

The blade blazes at Itzil's hip — nine-colored light visible in daylight. Every hero walks with her. Skyren reports from altitude: the capital under a bleeding sky, the Crown circling, and through the fissure — a shadow. Vast. Moving. "It's bigger than a continent."

**Key Events:** Full mobilization, honest speech to army, northward march, Skyren's reconnaissance of the capital.

**Cliffhanger:** A shadow visible through the fissure. Vast. Moving. Watching. Waiting.
