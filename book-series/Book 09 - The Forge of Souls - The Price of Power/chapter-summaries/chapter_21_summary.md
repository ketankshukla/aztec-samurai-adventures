# Chapter 21 Summary — SOLKREN'S REFLECTION

**POV:** Solkren

On the march, Solkren adjusts to being visible. People approach him — soldiers thank him, officers ask opinions, Itzil consults him. He's uncomfortable but quietly proud.

Discovery: the blade responds to all nine soul-threads. Each hero can channel a fraction of the blade's power through their own weapon — a force multiplier. "The blade is alive. It listens. Treat it like a partner, not a tool." "Like Korvain taught me to treat people." "Exactly."

**Key Events:** Solkren's adjustment to visibility, blade's distributed power discovered, force multiplier effect, partner not tool philosophy.

**Cliffhanger:** The foundation that holds everything together — the person who mattered most and believed he didn't matter at all.
