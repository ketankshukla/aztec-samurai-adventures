# Chapter 22 Summary — AMALURA'S ERRORS

**POV:** Amalura

Amalura briefs the team on every error she planted. Error 1: corrosion technique targets wrong frequency — useless against reforged blade. Error 2: Gate energy calculation 15% too low — activation will fail. Error 3: relic location displaced 200 miles.

The activation failure will create a window — hours, maybe a day. Alliance must reach the Gate during the window. Twelve days to the capital. Valdremor's attempt in ten. "Can we make it?" "If you don't stop." "We don't stop."

**Key Events:** Three errors detailed, activation failure predicted, window timing calculated, march pace critical.

**Cliffhanger:** The smartest person in the Dominion is about to discover his stolen knowledge is a weapon aimed at himself.
