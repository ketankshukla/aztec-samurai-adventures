# Chapter 23 Summary — THE EVE OF BATTLE

**POV:** Itzil

Army camps within sight of the Dominion capital. The fissure dominates the sky — red light flooding, Crown at 78%. The night is surreal. Soldiers write letters, sharpen blades, hold each other, pray, drink, sit in silence.

Itzil visits each hero — Kaelen (holding hands), Jagren (nodding), Neyla (sorting bandages), Rainara (watching the sky), Skyren, Zariel, Torvane, Solkren, Amalura. Returns to her tent. Whispers to the blade: "Tomorrow we finish this. Together." Nine threads pulse in response.

**Key Events:** Eve of battle rituals, Itzil visits each hero, personal moments with each, blade communion, nine pulses.

**Cliffhanger:** Tomorrow, everything ends or everything begins.
