# Chapter 24 Summary — THE GATE SCREAMS

**POV:** Itzil

Dawn breaks red. The army forms up. Vastrix's shadow visible through the fissure — bigger than a continent. Psychic pressure intensifies — soldiers stagger. The reforged blade flares, pushing back the assault for everyone in range.

The army cheers — not bravery, defiance. Itzil thinks of Korvain: "Show up." Miyako: "You don't need to be perfect." Kaelen: "Just you is enough." She points the blade forward. The army charges.

The Gate screams — Valdremor's mechanism tearing itself apart under the uncontrolled force. The final battle begins.

**Key Events:** Final charge launched, Vastrix visible, blade's defensive flare, Gate screaming as mechanism fails, battle for Dominion capital begins.

**Cliffhanger:** The final war has begun. Nine colors against the darkness. The army charges toward the Gate.
