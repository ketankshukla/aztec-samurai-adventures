Chapter 2 - THE PROPOSAL

Solkren explained the soul-forge to the full team, and the room went very quiet.

They gathered in the command tent — the space that had hosted a hundred strategic briefings, the table that usually held maps now holding Solkren's notes and the blade fragments arranged in the crystalline pattern that his study had identified. The tent was full — all nine heroes present, the complete team minus the dead and the captive, the surviving members of the alliance that had been built to fight an impossible war.

Solkren stood at the table's center. The position was unfamiliar — the armorer who occupied peripheries now standing at the focal point of the room's attention. His hands were steady. His voice was quiet. The delivery was the same delivery he always used — measured, factual, the particular register that made every statement sound like a technical specification rather than a request.

"Each hero must willingly give a defining memory," he said. "The core of who they are. The one moment that made them the person they became. The memory isn't lost — you'll still remember it. But its emotional weight transfers to the blade."

The silence that followed was the particular silence of people processing information that affected them personally. Strategic briefings produced focused silence — the attention of minds evaluating tactical options. This silence was different. This was the silence of people being asked to give something that couldn't be measured or replaced.

Jagren spoke first. The duelist's voice cut through the silence with the directness that had become his signature — the professional delivery that had replaced the theatrical flourishes of his pre-war personality.

"You want to take our memories?"

"Not take. Share." Solkren's correction was precise — the particular, important distinction that the process required. "You'll still remember everything. The memory stays. But the emotional weight — the feeling that the memory carries, the part that makes it who you are rather than just something that happened — that transfers to the blade."

Kaelen was practical. The scout's analytical mind evaluated the proposal with the intelligence assessment that he applied to every operational question. "What happens if someone refuses?"

"The forge is incomplete. The blade will be weaker. Each missing contribution reduces the weapon's capability proportionally. Nine contributions produce a blade that exceeds the original. Eight produce one that matches it. Fewer than that — the blade may not be strong enough for what we need it to do."

Neyla was concerned. The healer's medical perspective evaluated the process's risk profile with the diagnostic attention that she applied to every procedure that affected her patients. "Is it dangerous?"

Solkren paused. The particular pause that preceded honesty that the speaker wished could be avoided. "For you, no. The contribution is painless — uncomfortable, emotional, but not physically harmful. For me..." He looked at his hands — the large, scarred hands that decades of metalwork had shaped. "I'll be channeling the combined soul-energy of nine people through my hands. If I lose control, it could kill me."

The information settled. The risk was not distributed — it was concentrated. The process that asked each hero to give a piece of themselves asked the armorer to give everything. The conduit through which nine souls' energy would flow was one person's body, and the body's capacity to withstand that energy was not guaranteed.

Itzil looked at each of them. The commander's assessment was not tactical — it was personal. She was evaluating not their capability but their willingness. The soul-forge required voluntary contribution. Conscripted souls — memories given under pressure or obligation — would corrupt the process. The texts were explicit: the fire of many must burn willingly.

"I won't order this," she said. "This has to be your choice. Each of you. Freely given or not at all."

The silence returned. The particular, weighted quiet of people making a decision that would change them — not externally but internally, the choice to give a piece of identity to a weapon that would carry it forward.

Jagren spoke first. Again — the duelist stepping forward with the particular courage that his transformation had produced, the man who had learned to lead by going first.

"I'll do it."

The agreement surprised everyone. Jagren — who had been the most skeptical, who had asked the sharpest question — was the first to volunteer. The contradiction was the man himself — the performer who had learned that the most important performance was the one that wasn't performed at all.

Neyla agreed next. The healer's decision was delivered with the quiet certainty that characterized her medical judgments — the professional assessment that the benefit exceeded the risk, the willingness to undergo a procedure that she had evaluated and accepted.

Rainara agreed. The water-mystic's assent was a nod — the minimal gesture that communicated maximum commitment, the particular economy that Rainara employed when words were insufficient for the weight of what was being communicated.

Kaelen agreed. The scout's acceptance was professional — the analytical assessment that the mission required the contribution and that the contribution was within his capacity to provide. But beneath the professional assessment, something personal — the willingness to give a piece of himself to a weapon that would protect the person he loved.

Skyren agreed loudly. The hawk rider's assent was the most Skyren response possible — enthusiastic, immediate, the particular volume that she applied to everything. "Yes. Obviously. What are we waiting for?"

Zariel agreed with diplomatic precision. The spymaster's acceptance was carefully worded — the professional communicator selecting the language that conveyed both willingness and understanding. "I contribute willingly and with full awareness of the process's requirements."

Torvane agreed after a calculation. The engineer's acceptance followed a visible processing period — the analytical mind evaluating the variables, computing the outcomes, arriving at the conclusion that the process was sound. "The mathematics work. I'm in."

Nine heroes. Nine agreements. Each one voluntary. Each one carrying the weight of a choice that would change the person who made it.

Solkren looked at them. The armorer who had spent his life being invisible — the quiet man in the corner, the person no one watched — looked at the nine people who had agreed to give him pieces of their souls and felt the particular, overwhelming weight of trust that their agreement represented.

"Thank you," he said. The words were simple. The gratitude was immeasurable.

"When do we start?" Itzil asked.

"The forge needs preparation. Three days. And the rescue team needs to depart before the forging — the timing has to align."

"Kaelen leads the rescue," Itzil said. The decision was immediate — the commander's authority deploying the assignment with the confidence that the plan required. "Jagren and Rainara with him. The rest stay for the forge."

The plan was set. Parallel operations — the soul-forge and the rescue, running simultaneously, converging at the moment when the reforged blade and the rescued scholar would join the alliance's capability at the same time.

The team dispersed. Each person to their preparation — the internal work that the soul-forge required, the examination of memory and identity that preceded the contribution.

Solkren remained at the table. The fragments pulsed — the golden light responding to the agreement that nine people had made, the dormant energy sensing that the conditions for its awakening were approaching.

The armorer looked at the fragments. The metal that would become the most powerful weapon in the world. The material that would carry nine souls.

His hands were steady. His heart was not.

Three days. Then the forge would burn. And the blade would be reborn.
