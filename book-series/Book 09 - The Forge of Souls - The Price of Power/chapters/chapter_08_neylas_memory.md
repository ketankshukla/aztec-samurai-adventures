Chapter 8 - NEYLA'S MEMORY

Neyla contributed at the forge and the turquoise light wept with her.

The healer stepped to the forge's edge — the boundary between the cave's cooler air and the volcanic heat that Solkren's workspace generated. The Sunheart pulsed above the fragment array — four golden threads now connecting the relic to the growing blade, the soul-contributions of Itzil, Kaelen, Jagren, and the space that waited for the fifth.

Solkren guided her. The armorer's voice was steady — the professional delivery maintained despite the accumulated strain of channeling three soul-contributions through his body. His hands glowed faintly — the residual energy of the souls he had processed visible on his skin, the particular luminosity that the forge's conduit produced.

"Think of the memory," he said. "The one that defined you."

Neyla closed her eyes. The healer's diagnostic perception — the sense that assessed patients and injuries and biological states — turned inward. The particular, uncomfortable experience of a person trained to examine others being asked to examine themselves.

Her memory was immediate. Not searched for — it was there, at the surface, the defining experience that she had been carrying since before the war began. The memory that had made her a healer. The memory that had driven every decision, every technique, every midnight healing session that the war had demanded.

Her family. The last time she saw them.

Her mother's face — the expression that existed between composure and collapse, the particular quality that a parent's face displayed when they were trying to be brave for their child and the bravery was failing. Her mother's eyes were bright with unshed tears. Her smile was the particular, devastating smile that people produced when they knew that the moment they were in was the last moment and they wanted the last image to be one of warmth rather than grief.

Her father's hands — the large, calloused hands that had held her as a child, that had taught her to mix medicines, that had guided her first attempts at the healing arts that would become her life's work. His hands were shaking. The tremor that fear produced — the fear of what was coming, the fear for the child they were sending away, the fear that the goodbye was permanent.

Her sister's laugh — the bright, spontaneous sound that her younger sister produced at the most inappropriate moments, the particular gift that some people had for finding joy in circumstances that joy shouldn't survive. Her sister laughed because Neyla was crying, and the laugh said: don't cry, I'll be fine, we'll see each other again.

They didn't see each other again. The ash-oaths took them. Her family — her mother, her father, her sister — were enslaved by the Dominion's binding system, their consciousness harvested, their identities erased. They became the particular, devastating absence that the ash-oath produced — bodies that moved and functioned and performed tasks without the awareness that made them people.

Neyla was giving up her grief. Not the love — the love was permanent, embedded at a depth that the forge couldn't reach. The paralyzing, crushing weight of what was lost. The grief that had been pressing her down since the day she learned what had happened to her family. The weight that made every healing feel like an attempt to repair the irreparable. The sorrow that colored every moment of her life with the particular, persistent darkness that loss produced when loss was total.

She let it go. The release was accompanied by tears — the physical expression of emotional weight being removed, the body responding to the internal shift with the moisture that grief produced. The turquoise light — her healing magic, the energy that was connected to her emotional state — surged. The light wept with her — the particular, luminous tears that her magic produced when the healer's emotional state reached the threshold that the magic responded to.

The golden thread connected. The soul-contribution flowed from Neyla's consciousness to the forge — the grief, the loss, the crushing weight of a family that was gone. The fragments absorbed it. The blade drank the sorrow with the particular, hungry reception that the forge maintained for every contribution.

Neyla wept as the memory transferred. The tears were real — the physical, involuntary response that the release produced. But the quality of the tears changed as the contribution completed. The tears that began as grief ended as relief — the particular, unexpected lightness that existed when a weight that had been carried for years was finally shared.

The grief was still there. The loss was still present. Her family was still gone. But the weight — the crushing, paralyzing, consuming weight that had been pressing her into the ground since the day she learned — was lighter. Not eliminated. Redistributed. The blade carried what she could not.

"Four," Solkren said. His hands were glowing brighter — the accumulated soul-energy producing a luminosity that exceeded what the previous contributions had generated. Four threads connected to the fragments. The metal was warming. Reshaping. The dimensional structure that the contributions were building was becoming visible — the fragments losing their individual shapes and beginning to flow together, the separate pieces merging into the continuous structure that a blade required.

Neyla wiped her eyes. The turquoise light steadied — the healer's magic stabilizing as the emotional surge subsided, the energy returning to the constant, reliable output that her professional discipline maintained.

"Are you all right?" Solkren asked. The question was genuine — the armorer's concern for the person whose soul he had just channeled through his hands, the particular care that existed when a craftsman recognized the cost of the material he was working with.

"Better," Neyla said. The word surprised her. The assessment was not the response she expected — not the depletion or the disorientation that she had anticipated. Better. Actually, genuinely, unexpectedly better. The grief was lighter. The darkness was less. The healing that she had spent months providing to others had, through the forge's mechanism, been applied to herself.

"Actually... better."

The words hung in the cave's heated air. The healer who healed others — who had never been able to heal herself, who had carried the grief of her family's loss as a permanent, untreatable wound — was better. Not healed. Better.

Solkren nodded. The armorer's acknowledgment was simple — the professional's recognition that the process was working as designed, that the soul-forge was not just creating a weapon but was providing the contributors with the particular, unexpected gift that sharing produced.

Four down. Five to go. The forge burned. The blade grew. And the healer — lighter, clearer, carrying only the love and not the weight — returned to her station and prepared for whatever came next.
