Chapter 18 - VASTRIX SPEAKS

The voice hit the continent like a fist made of hunger, and every living thing heard it.

Not with ears. The transmission was not acoustic — it was dimensional. The psychic projection that Vastrix produced traveled through the barrier's weakening structure and into the consciousness of every person on the continent simultaneously. The voice was not words — it was pressure and intent and the particular, devastating communication that existed when something vast enough to have its own gravity expressed itself in a medium that human minds could barely process.

**I SEE YOU. ALL OF YOU. AND I AM HUNGRY.**

The impact was universal. Every person on the continent — soldier and civilian, alliance and Dominion, adult and child — felt it. The voice pressed against consciousness like an ocean pressing against a wall — the sheer mass of the entity's awareness overwhelming the defenses that individual minds maintained against external psychic intrusion.

Soldiers dropped to their knees. The alliance army — three thousand seven hundred people camped in the terrain that the southern march had brought them to — experienced the voice as a physical force. Men and women who had fought through months of war, who had maintained discipline through battles and losses and the grinding attrition that conflict produced, fell to the ground under the weight of a consciousness that exceeded anything human perception was designed to process.

Children cried. Across the continent — in the cities and villages and refugee camps that the war had produced — the youngest and most vulnerable experienced the voice as terror. The particular, primal fear that existed when a predator's attention found prey and the prey understood, at the deepest level of biological instinct, that the predator was incomprehensibly larger than anything the prey had ever encountered.

Animals bolted. The non-human inhabitants of the continent — the horses, the dogs, the birds, the creatures whose instincts were less filtered by cognitive processing than human instincts — responded with the immediate, unmodulated flight response that overwhelming threat produced.

Itzil felt it press against her mind. The weight — the particular, grinding pressure of Vastrix's awareness focused on the human world — pushed against her consciousness with the force that an ocean exerted against a seawall. The pressure was not targeted — Vastrix didn't single her out. The entity's awareness was omnidirectional — the hunger that perceived everything simultaneously, the attention that didn't distinguish between individuals because individuals were irrelevant to an appetite that consumed worlds.

The reforged blade responded. The nine soul-threads that the weapon contained blazed — the collective energy activating in defensive mode, the blade's dimensional architecture producing a counter-frequency that pushed back against the psychic pressure. The pushback was not aggressive — it was protective. The blade created a space around Itzil where the voice's pressure was reduced, the dimensional shield that the nine contributions provided converting the overwhelming force into the manageable weight that the bearer could withstand.

The protection extended. The blade's defensive field — the dimensional counter-frequency that the nine threads produced — radiated outward from Itzil's position, creating a zone of reduced psychic pressure that encompassed the soldiers nearest to her. The people within the zone felt the voice but were not crushed by it — the blade's protection converting the unbearable into the merely terrifying.

The allied army was shaken to its core. The soldiers who had maintained discipline through every previous challenge — through battles and losses and the breaking of the Sun-Blade and the death of their commanders' mentors — were confronted with something that exceeded the category of challenges they had been trained to face.

This wasn't a warlord. This wasn't a sorcerer. This wasn't an army or a weapon or a strategic threat that could be analyzed and countered. This was something beyond comprehension — a hunger that was bigger than a continent, an awareness that perceived everything simultaneously, a force that existed on a scale that made human conflict seem like the territorial disputes of insects.

The voice faded. The psychic projection withdrew — Vastrix's attention releasing the human world with the particular, casual disinterest of a predator that had assessed its prey and was content to wait for the barrier to weaken further before pressing through. The withdrawal was not retreat. It was patience. The entity knew the barrier was failing. The entity knew the Gate was opening. The entity could afford to wait.

The aftermath was silence. The particular, devastating quiet that existed when a large number of people had experienced something that exceeded their capacity to process and were sitting in the cognitive vacuum that overwhelm produced.

Amalura broke the silence. The scholar — who had been standing at the command tent's entrance when the voice hit, who had experienced the psychic projection with the analytical attention that her training demanded — spoke with the particular, clinical delivery that converted terror into information.

"The Gate is partially open," she said. "Vastrix is projecting through the crack — using the fissure as a channel for psychic communication. It's not here yet. This is just its voice."

The distinction was essential. The voice — the overwhelming, continent-spanning psychic projection that had driven soldiers to their knees and children to tears — was not Vastrix's physical presence. It was communication. The entity was speaking through the crack in the barrier the way a person spoke through a gap in a door. The voice could reach them. The entity could not. Not yet.

"If that's just its VOICE," Itzil said, "what happens when it gets through?"

Amalura was quiet. The particular, weighted silence that preceded information that the speaker wished could be avoided.

"Everything ends," she said. The words were simple. The finality they contained was absolute. "Vastrix doesn't conquer. It doesn't rule. It consumes. Every living thing. Every consciousness. Every spark of awareness on the continent — human, animal, magical. All of it. Consumed. Absorbed into an appetite that is never satisfied because satisfaction isn't part of its nature."

The information settled. The team — the nine heroes who had given pieces of their souls to the reforged blade — absorbed the scale of the threat they were facing. Not an enemy that could be defeated in combat. A force of nature that could only be contained — sealed behind the barrier that the Sun-Blade had been designed to maintain.

"The blade can push it back," Amalura continued. "The reforged blade — with its nine-soul architecture — has the dimensional frequency required to reinforce the barrier. To seal the Gate. To close the crack. But it has to be used at the Gate itself. The bearer has to be physically present at the dimensional breach."

"The Dominion capital," Itzil said.

"The Dominion capital. Where the Gate is. Where the fissure is. Where Vastrix is pressing through."

The destination was clear. The objective was clear. The impossibility was clear.

March an army to the Dominion capital. Fight through the Dominion's military forces. Reach the Gate. Use the reforged blade to seal the barrier. Close the crack. Push Vastrix back.

Simple. Impossible. Necessary.

The team looked at each other. Nine heroes. One scholar. One army. Against a hunger the size of a continent.

The blade pulsed on Itzil's hip. Nine threads blazing. Nine souls ready.

The voice echoed in memory. I SEE YOU. ALL OF YOU. AND I AM HUNGRY.

They had been seen. They had been measured. The hunger knew they existed.

Now they had to march toward it.
