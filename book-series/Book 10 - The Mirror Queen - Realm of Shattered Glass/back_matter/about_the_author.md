# About the Author

**Ketan Shukla** is the author of the *Aztec Samurai Adventures* series and multiple non-fiction titles. He writes stories about compassion as a weapon — about the people who heal what others break, who see what others can't, and who offer open doors to those who tried to kill them.

He lives with his wife Nimisha and believes that the most powerful thing a person can say to another is: *"I see you. I'm here. You're going home."*

*Aztec Samurai Adventures* is his first fiction series.
