# Author's Note

Thank you for reading *The Mirror Queen*.

This book belongs to Neyla. The healer. The woman who walked into a shattered glass dimension to free the souls that the Dominion had stolen — and who, when she found the assassin who had been sent to kill her, looked at her and said: "I can see what they did to you."

That line is the heart of this book. Not a battle cry. Not a defiant speech. A diagnosis. A healer looking at a person who had been modified against her will and seeing — not the assassin, not the enemy — the patient.

Neyla left the door open. A healing ward on Mirathane's prison. An invitation that might never be accepted. The offer of healing extended to someone who tried to kill her. That's who Neyla is. That's who I wanted her to be — the character who demonstrates that compassion isn't weakness. Compassion is the weapon that the Dominion can't understand and can't counter.

The Mirror-Realm sequence was a joy and a terror to write. The fractured glass dimension, the recursive reflections, Rainara fighting an assassin made of mirrors with water that warped every surface — all of it built toward the cascade. Thousands of souls freed. The Gate shuddering. Vastrix screaming. The Starless Crown flickering.

And then: Neyla's new sight. The ability to see soul-threads — the golden connections between every living thing. Beautiful and terrifying. Because now she can see Vastrix's true form: not a creature. A dimension. Bigger than the world.

The siege has begun. The outer ring has fallen. The inner walls wait. Two books remain.

Hold on tight. The hardest part hasn't even started.

With gratitude,
Ketan Shukla
