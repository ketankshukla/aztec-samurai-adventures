# A Quick Favor

If Neyla's words — "I can see what they did to you" — hit you the way they hit me, would you consider leaving a review on Amazon?

Reviews help other readers find the series. And they help me keep writing stories about healers who offer open doors to the people who tried to kill them.

Even a single sentence:

> *"Compassion as a weapon. I wasn't ready for that."*

Thank you for reading. The siege has begun. Two books remain.
