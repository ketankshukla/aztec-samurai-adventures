# Aztec Samurai Adventures Book 10: The Mirror Queen - Realm of Shattered Glass

Compassion becomes the most devastating weapon in the war. Neyla's healing magic — the power to reverse ash-oaths — becomes the key to unraveling the Dominion's entire infrastructure. The Mirror-Realm awaits, and with it, the assassin Mirathane.

THE LIBERATION CAMPAIGN: The allied army advances toward the Dominion capital, liberating cities along the way. Neyla works at the front — reversing oaths in seconds, freeing hundreds per day. Each freed person is a strategic blow: every broken oath drains power from the Great Gate.

VALDREMOR'S COUNTER: Valdremor detects the power drain. "She's more dangerous than the Sun-Blade." He deploys his ultimate counter: Mirathane, the mirrorcraft assassin who kills through reflections and moves through mirrors. Mission: kill Neyla.

THE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS: Mirathane strikes from a water bowl — a blade of light nearly takes Neyla's head off. One inch saved her life. Kaelen orders every mirror smashed, every water barrel covered. The second strike comes from a polished stone. Kaelen intercepts with a thrown blade. "We can't block surfaces — there are too many." Itzil: "Then we go to her. Into the Mirror-Realm."

THE MIRROR-REALM: Amalura reveals the dimension where ash-oath souls are stored — trapped in mirror-cells, slowly consumed. Neyla enters with Rainara as escort. The realm is beautiful and horrifying: shattered glass sky, recursive reflections, shifting floors. They find thousands of trapped souls pressing against the glass in silent screams.

MIRATHANE VS. RAINARA: The assassin attacks in her domain — terrifying, flowing from surface to surface. Rainara fights water vs. mirrors: flooding surfaces to warp Mirathane's portals, shattering mirror-walls to collapse movement options. Mirathane fragments into twelve reflections. Rainara pulls water from EVERY surface, creating a sphere that distorts all mirrors. The reflections blur. Mirathane screams.

THE CASCADE: While Rainara fights, Neyla frees souls — ten, fifty, a hundred. The chain reaction begins: each freed soul's energy helps free the next. Thousands freed. The Mirror-Realm shudders. The Great Gate SHUDDERS. The Starless Crown flickers.

MIRATHANE DEFEATED: Trapped in a recursive loop — fighting her own reflections forever. Neyla sees the demon-bond: "I can see what they did to you." The assassin hesitates — the first hesitation of her life. Neyla places a healing ward on the prison: "If you change your mind, the door is open." Fifth villain defeated.

AFTERMATH: The Gate's energy drops 30%. The Crown stutters. Vastrix screams. Across the continent, ash-oath slaves wake up. Neyla gains soul-sight — can see the golden connections between all living things. She sees Vastrix's true form: not a creature but a DIMENSION. "It's bigger than our WORLD."

THE PUSH: The army capitalizes — rapid advance, liberating cities. Dominion morale collapses. Zariel's disinformation campaign fractures the empire from within. Regional governors surrender. Military commanders defect. Helisar sends a cryptic message: "I'm beginning to wonder if peace was the wrong word for what I built."

THE SIEGE: The army reaches the capital's outer defenses. Dawn assault: Thalendor infantry behind Torvane's ward-shields, Pyrrath cavalry flanking, shock troops hitting the northwestern weakness. Itzil fights at the front with the reforged blade. Torvane detonates wall charges. The outer wall breaks. The army pours through.

Street fighting in the outskirts — block by block toward the inner walls. Nightshade's blood-ward soldiers fight like automatons. Neyla reverses blood-wards on captured soldiers. The army reaches the inner wall.

Beyond: the palace district, Nightshade's flag, Valdremor's Spire, and the Great Gate — the fissure pulsing red, the shadow pressing through. The final battle is here.
