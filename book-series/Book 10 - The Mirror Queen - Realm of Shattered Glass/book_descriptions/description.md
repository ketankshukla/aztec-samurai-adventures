# Book Description — Aztec Samurai Adventures Book 10: The Mirror Queen - Realm of Shattered Glass

## Subtitle: Realm of Shattered Glass

---

<b>The healer walks into a dimension made of shattered glass. Every mirror is a weapon. Every reflection hides an assassin. And the only way to free thousands of trapped souls is to survive long enough to reach them.</b>

<p>Neyla's ash-oath reversal technique is draining the Great Gate's power — one freed soul at a time. Valdremor's response? Send Mirathane, an assassin who kills through reflections. Any mirror. Any water. Any polished surface. She never fails.</p>

<p><b>In this book:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>A healer enters a fractured glass dimension to free the souls that power the enemy's doomsday weapon</li>
<li>A water-mystic fights a mirror-assassin in the assassin's own domain — water vs. reflections in a realm where physics is a suggestion</li>
<li>Thousands of trapped souls freed in a cascade that shakes the Gate and makes a continent-sized entity SCREAM</li>
<li>A healer looks at the assassin who tried to kill her and says: "I can see what they did to you"</li>
<li>A new sight reveals the truth: Vastrix isn't a creature — it's a dimension. Bigger than the world.</li>
<li>The siege of the Dominion capital begins — and the outer wall falls</li>
</ul>

<p><i>The Mirror Queen</i> is the book where compassion becomes a weapon of mass liberation. Neyla's turquoise light doesn't destroy — it reverses. It doesn't attack — it heals. And in a war where the enemy's power comes from stolen souls, healing is the most devastating force on the battlefield.</p>

<p>For fans of <i>The Poppy War</i>, <i>Mistborn</i>, and stories where the healer is the most dangerous person in the room — a book about what happens when you offer an open door to someone who tried to kill you.</p>

<p><i>"I see you. I'm here. You're going home."</i></p>

<p><b>Book 10 of 12 in the <i>Aztec Samurai Adventures</i> series. Act III: The Reckoning continues. From Ketan Shukla, published by Metronagon.</b></p>
