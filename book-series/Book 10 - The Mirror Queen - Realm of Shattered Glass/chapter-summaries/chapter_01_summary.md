# Chapter 1 Summary — THE LIBERATION CAMPAIGN

**POV:** Neyla

Allied army advances, liberating cities. Neyla works at the front — reversing oaths in seconds. Each freed person is a strategic blow draining the Gate. Freed people collapse, scream, cry. Neyla holds their hands: "I see you. I'm here. You're going home."

After a full day: 500+ freed. Exhausted. Amalura: "The Gate's energy output has dropped measurably. It's working."

**Key Events:** Liberation campaign begins, 500+ freed in one day, Gate energy dropping, cascade effect starting.

**Cliffhanger:** Every soul freed weakens the Gate. The healer's hands are the most dangerous weapon in the war.
