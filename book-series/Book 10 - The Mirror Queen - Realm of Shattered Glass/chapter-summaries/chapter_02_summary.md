# Chapter 2 Summary — VALDREMOR'S COUNTER

**POV:** Valdremor (Villain)

Valdremor detects the power drain. "She's more dangerous than the Sun-Blade." Deploys Mirathane — mirrorcraft assassin who kills through reflections, moves through mirrors. Never failed. Mission: kill Neyla. Not capture — kill.

Mirathane receives orders. Doesn't speak. Nods. Steps into a mirror and vanishes.

**Key Events:** Power drain detected, healer identified as primary threat, Mirathane deployed, assassination mission initiated.

**Cliffhanger:** The mirror on the wall is watching. The healer doesn't know.
