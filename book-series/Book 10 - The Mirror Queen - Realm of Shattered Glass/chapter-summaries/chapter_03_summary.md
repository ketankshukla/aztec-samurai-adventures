# Chapter 3 Summary — THE FIRST STRIKE

**POV:** Neyla

Neyla's water bowl EXPLODES. A mirror-bright blade nearly takes her head off — one inch from death. The blade retracts into the water's surface. No evidence. Mirathane's first strike.

Kaelen orders: every mirror smashed, every water barrel covered, every polished surface dulled. That night, Neyla can't sleep. Every shadow might contain a blade.

**Key Events:** First assassination attempt, one-inch margin, camp-wide mirror elimination, Neyla terrorized.

**Cliffhanger:** Mirathane has weaponized Neyla's entire environment.
