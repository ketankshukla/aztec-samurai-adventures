# Chapter 4 Summary — MIRATHANE'S WORLD

**POV:** Mirathane (Villain)

First Mirathane POV. She exists in the Mirror-Realm — shattered glass mosaic dimension. Cold, precise, barely human. Demon-bond replaced emotions with geometric certainty. Doesn't hate the healer — simply executes the equation.

Watches Neyla through every reflective surface: dewdrops, belt buckles, beads of sweat. Plans the kill: tomorrow, town square fountain. Perfect mirror. Perfect angle.

**Key Events:** Mirror-Realm revealed, Mirathane's demon-bond nature, surveillance through micro-reflections, kill-shot planned.

**Cliffhanger:** Tomorrow. The fountain. The still water. The equation demands a solution.
