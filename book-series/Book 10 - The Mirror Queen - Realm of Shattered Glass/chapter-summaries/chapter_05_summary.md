# Chapter 5 Summary — THE SECOND STRIKE

**POV:** Kaelen

Kaelen anticipates the attack — shadow-sense detects light distortions. Fountain covered with tarp (his order). Mirathane adapts: strikes from a polished courtyard stone. Blade aimed at Neyla's back.

Kaelen's thrown blade deflects the mirror-strike. Mirathane retreats into the stone. "She's adapting. We can't just block surfaces — there are too many." Itzil: "Then we go to her. Into the Mirror-Realm."

**Key Events:** Second assassination attempt blocked by Kaelen, Mirathane adapts to countermeasures, decision to enter Mirror-Realm.

**Cliffhanger:** The insanity of entering the assassin's domain is preferable to living in a world where every reflection is a weapon.
