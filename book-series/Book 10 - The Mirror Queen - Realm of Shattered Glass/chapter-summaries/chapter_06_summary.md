# Chapter 6 Summary — AMALURA'S REVELATION

**POV:** Amalura

Amalura explains: the Mirror-Realm is where ash-oath souls are stored — trapped in mirror-cells. Neyla's healing magic links her to the souls inside. The plan: Neyla enters and frees souls en masse. Rainara escorts and fights Mirathane.

"You'll be blind and lost. She'll be at home. Your only advantage: compassion. She can't see soul-threads. You can." Neyla: "Those souls are trapped because of me. I'm going in." Rainara: "I'm coming. Water and mirrors are cousins."

**Key Events:** Mirror-Realm explained, soul storage revealed, mission planned, Neyla and Rainara volunteer.

**Cliffhanger:** Compassion is coming. The assassin's equations can't solve it.
