# Chapter 7 Summary — ENTERING THE MIRROR

**POV:** Neyla

Neyla touches a still pool and falls through the world. The Mirror-Realm: shattered glass sky, recursive reflections, shifting ground. Beautiful and horrifying. Rainara slides through after her — water-magic works here.

They find the trapped souls: thousands of flickering figures in mirror-cells, pressing against the glass, mouths open in silent screams. Neyla touches the first cell. It cracks. "I see you. I'm here. You're going home."

**Key Events:** Mirror-Realm entered, dimension described, soul-threads as navigation, first mirror-cell cracked, first soul freed.

**Cliffhanger:** One freed. Thousands remaining. And the assassin feels the intrusion.
