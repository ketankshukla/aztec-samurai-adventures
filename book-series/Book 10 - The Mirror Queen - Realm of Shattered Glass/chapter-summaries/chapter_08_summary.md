# Chapter 8 Summary — MIRATHANE ATTACKS

**POV:** Rainara

Mirathane materializes — fractured light, blade in each hand. Terrifying in her domain: flows from surface to surface, attacks from any direction. Rainara fights her: water floods mirrors, warps portals. Mirathane hits a water-wall instead of passing through a mirror.

Mirathane fragments into twelve reflections. Rainara pulls water from EVERY surface — a sphere that distorts all mirrors. The reflections blur. Mirathane screams. Twelve collapse into one.

**Key Events:** Mirathane attacks in her domain, water vs. mirrors combat, fragmentation technique countered, Rainara's water-sphere.

**Cliffhanger:** "Your move." Behind Rainara, Neyla continues freeing souls.
