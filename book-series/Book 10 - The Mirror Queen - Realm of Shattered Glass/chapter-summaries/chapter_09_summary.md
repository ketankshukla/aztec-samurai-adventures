# Chapter 9 Summary — FREEING SOULS

**POV:** Neyla

While Rainara fights, Neyla works. Ten freed. Fifty. A hundred. Her magic amplifies in the Mirror-Realm — closer to the source. She discovers chaining: free one soul and its energy helps free the next. Cascade effect.

She opens her arms and lets the chain run. Hundreds. Thousands. The Mirror-Realm shudders. The Great Gate SHUDDERS. They escape through Rainara's water-portal as the dimension collapses. Neyla collapses — exhausted beyond measure. But thousands freed.

**Key Events:** Cascade liberation, chain reaction, thousands freed, Mirror-Realm destabilized, Gate shudders, dimension collapses.

**Cliffhanger:** The healer freed thousands with compassion. The dimension is emptied of prisoners.
