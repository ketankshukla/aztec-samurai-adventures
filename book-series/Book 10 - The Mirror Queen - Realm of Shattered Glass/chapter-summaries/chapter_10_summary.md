# Chapter 10 Summary — MIRATHANE CORNERED

**POV:** Rainara

Mirathane losing — domain collapsing, mirrors dissolving. Fights with desperate fury. Rainara creates a trap: water-sphere encasing a mirror-wall, then collapses it. Mirathane caught half in, half out of a mirror.

Neyla approaches. Sees the demon-bond — dark threads. "I can see what they did to you." Mirathane hesitates — first hesitation of her life. Then strikes. Rainara creates a recursive mirror loop. Mirathane trapped fighting herself forever.

**Key Events:** Mirathane cornered, demon-bond visible, "I can see what they did to you," first hesitation, recursive loop prison.

**Cliffhanger:** Fifth villain defeated. Mirror assassin trapped by mirrors.
