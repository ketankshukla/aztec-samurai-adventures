# Chapter 11 Summary — THE ASSASSIN'S PRISON

**POV:** Neyla

Neyla studies the prison. The demon-bond was imposed in childhood — Mirathane was modified against her will. The child still exists beneath the assassin. Neyla places a healing ward on the prison boundary: "If you change your mind, the door is open."

They escape the collapsing Mirror-Realm through Rainara's water-portal. The dimension seals shut — emptied of prisoners. The recursive loop persists in the void. The door remains open.

**Key Events:** Demon-bond diagnosed as childhood imposition, healing ward placed, Mirror-Realm sealed, door left open.

**Cliffhanger:** The offer of healing persists regardless of whether the patient accepts.
