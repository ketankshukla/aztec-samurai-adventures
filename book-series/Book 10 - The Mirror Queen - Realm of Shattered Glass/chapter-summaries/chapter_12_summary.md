# Chapter 12 Summary — THE MASS LIBERATION

**POV:** Neyla

The cascade continues in the physical world. Weakened oaths crack easily — trained healers perform reversals. The Gate's energy reserves plummet. Starless Crown flickers. Fissure wavers. VASTRIX SCREAMS — a psychic howl shaking both dimensions.

Across the continent, ash-oath slaves wake up. Thousands freed. Itzil grips the blade: "Now. While they're reeling. We push."

**Key Events:** Physical-world cascade, Gate energy drops 30%, Crown stutters, Vastrix screams, continent-wide liberation, aggressive push ordered.

**Cliffhanger:** The compassion is working. The Gate is shuddering. The push begins.
