# Chapter 13 Summary — THE GATE WEAKENS

**POV:** Itzil

Immediate effects: Starless Crown stutters, fissure narrows, Vastrix's psychic pressure lessens. Soldiers stand taller. Reports: ash-oath slaves waking across the continent. Dominion infrastructure crumbling.

Amalura calculates: Gate energy dropped 30%. Threshold failure approaching — Valdremor's activation attempt will fail due to planted errors. Window: 8-12 hours. "We need to be at the Gate when the window opens." Itzil: "Push."

**Key Events:** Crown stutters, fissure narrows, pressure lessens, 30% energy drop, window timing calculated, aggressive push ordered.

**Cliffhanger:** The blade blazes at the army's head like a dawn that arrived early.
