# Chapter 14 Summary — NEYLA'S NEW SIGHT

**POV:** Neyla

Neyla wakes changed — can see soul-threads. Golden connections between all living things. The reforged blade's nine colored threads visible. Beautiful.

She looks at the Dominion capital: a web of dark threads converging on the Gate. And through it — Vastrix. Not a creature. A DIMENSION. An entire plane of existence made of hunger. "It's bigger than a continent." Pause. "It's bigger than our WORLD."

**Key Events:** Soul-sight gained, golden web visible, blade threads seen, Vastrix's true nature revealed — a dimension, not a creature.

**Cliffhanger:** The stakes went from apocalyptic to existential.
