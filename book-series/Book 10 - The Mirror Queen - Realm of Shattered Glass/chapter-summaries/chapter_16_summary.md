# Chapter 16 Summary — THE DOMINION FRACTURES

**POV:** Zariel

Zariel's disinformation campaign bears fruit. Regional governors surrender. Military commanders defect. The Dominion's monolithic facade cracks from within.

Helisar sends a cryptic message: "I'm beginning to wonder if peace was the wrong word for what I built." Itzil: "Cracked people make interesting choices." Filed for Book 12.

**Key Events:** Dominion fracturing, surrenders negotiated, defections managed, Helisar's doubt emerges.

**Cliffhanger:** The shell is cracking. Cracked shells are easier to break than intact ones.
