# Chapter 17 Summary — RAINARA'S HEALING

**POV:** Rainara

After the Mirror-Realm, Rainara's rage has cooled — shifted from vengeance to guardianship. She patrols the army's water supply, detecting and purifying poisoned wells. The army's silent guardian.

Develops water-scrying: reads flowing water patterns to detect troop movements miles away. Better than scouts. She stands at a river — the water is cleaner. Cups some and drinks. It tastes like home. She almost smiles.

**Key Events:** Rage-to-protectiveness shift complete, water purification role, water-scrying ability, emotional healing.

**Cliffhanger:** The water flows. The rage is quieter. The protectiveness is stronger. Almost whole.
