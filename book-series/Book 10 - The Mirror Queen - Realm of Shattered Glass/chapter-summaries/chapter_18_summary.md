# Chapter 18 Summary — THE OUTER DEFENSES

**POV:** Itzil

Army reaches the capital's outer defenses: fortifications, trenches, ward-barriers. Every remaining Dominion soldier, sorcerer, and war-beast consolidated here. Itzil assigns assault teams — three waves: breach outer defenses, take capital walls, reach the Gate.

Draws the reforged blade. All nine colors blaze. The army sees it and knows: this is the final push. "Forward."

**Key Events:** Outer defenses assessed, three-wave assault planned, blade drawn, army mobilized.

**Cliffhanger:** No retreat. No surrender. Just forward.
