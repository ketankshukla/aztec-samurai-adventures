# Chapter 19 Summary — SKYREN'S RECONNAISSANCE

**POV:** Skyren

Most dangerous flight of the war. Anti-air batteries every hundred yards, wind-sorcery turbulence. Cielovar dodges everything — they've become one being. Maps the capital: Gate at dead center, fissure fifty yards wide, shadow moving through it.

Key positions: Nightshade's blood-ward perimeter (three rings), Ashvanar's sorcery tower, Valdremor's Spire. Unexpected: Serenthar's chamber beneath the palace — the oracle is waiting. Returns arrow-grazed: "Here's how we get in. It won't be easy."

**Key Events:** Final recon, capital mapped, defensive positions identified, Serenthar located, assault route planned.

**Cliffhanger:** "It might not be possible. But here's how."
