# Chapter 20 Summary — THE EVE OF THE SIEGE

**POV:** Itzil

Night before the siege. Soldiers write letters, sharpen blades, hold each other, pray, drink, sit in silence. Itzil walks the camp visiting each hero: Kaelen (holding hands over maps), Jagren (praying — first time), Neyla (distributing medical supplies), Rainara, Skyren, Zariel, Torvane, Solkren, Amalura.

Returns to tent. Holds the blade. Whispers: "Tomorrow." Nine threads pulse in response. Not alone.

**Key Events:** Eve of battle rituals, personal moments with each hero, Jagren praying, blade communion.

**Cliffhanger:** Tomorrow, everything ends or everything begins.
