# Chapter 21 Summary — TORVANE'S PREPARATIONS

**POV:** Torvane

Torvane deploys engineering for the siege: siege engines, ward-disruptors, explosive charges, communication arrays. Special creation: mobile ward-shield powered by Starshard relic's residual energy — protects advancing columns from sorcery.

Checks every device personally. Every bolt tight. Every charge stable. "Everything has a weakness. Even empires." Northwestern wall section — thinner stone, older construction. That's where they breach.

**Key Events:** Siege engineering deployed, mobile ward-shield revealed, personal verification of every device, breach point confirmed.

**Cliffhanger:** The engineer's care is the weapon. Tomorrow tests everything he built.
