# Chapter 22 Summary — VALDREMOR PREPARES

**POV:** Valdremor (Villain)

Valdremor in his Spire of Glass — prepared but with flawed data. Expects corrosion spell to work on reforged blade (it won't). Expects Gate to have more energy than it does. Expects defenses to hold longer. Still brilliant — layered redundancies.

Visits Serenthar: "How does this end?" "In one future, you win. In another, you lose. In both, you wish you'd done things differently." For the first time, Valdremor wonders if he should be afraid.

**Key Events:** Flawed calculations active, redundant defenses layered, Serenthar's prophecy of regret, first hint of doubt.

**Cliffhanger:** Should I be afraid? The absence of an answer is the most frightening thing he's experienced.
