# Chapter 23 Summary — THE SIEGE BEGINS

**POV:** Itzil

Dawn assault. Thalendor infantry behind Torvane's ward-shields. Pyrrath cavalry flanks. Shock troops hit the northwest weakness. Dominion responds with everything: arrows, sorcery, war-beasts, blood-wards.

Itzil fights at the front — blade's shockwaves of golden light. Soul-threads resonate — every nearby hero boosted. Rainara creates water-walls. Skyren coordinates from air. Jagren leads breach team. Torvane detonates wall charges. The outer wall cracks. Then breaks. Army pours through.

**Key Events:** Dawn assault launched, ward-shields hold, coordinated multi-sector attack, wall breached, outer ring falls.

**Cliffhanger:** The outer ring is down. But the inner walls, the palace, and the Gate still wait. The hardest part hasn't started.
