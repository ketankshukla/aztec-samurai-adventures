# Chapter 24 Summary — THROUGH THE BREACH

**POV:** Itzil

Street fighting in the capital's outskirts. Close quarters, brutal. Nightshade's blood-ward soldiers fight like automatons. Neyla reverses blood-wards on captured soldiers — each one freed is one less enemy.

Block by block toward the inner walls. Vastrix's pressure intensifies. The blade pushes back. They reach the inner wall. Beyond: Nightshade's flag, Valdremor's Spire, and the Gate — fissure pulsing red, shadow pressing through. The final battle is here.

**Key Events:** Street fighting, blood-ward soldiers engaged, Neyla reversing wards, inner wall reached, final defenses visible.

**Cliffhanger:** Beyond the inner wall: Nightshade, Valdremor, the Gate, and the hunger. The fight that determines everything.
