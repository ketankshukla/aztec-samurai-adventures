Chapter 2 - VALDREMOR'S COUNTER

Valdremor detected the power drain in his study and the numbers confirmed what his instincts had already told him: the healer was more dangerous than the blade.

The Architect sat at his crystalline desk — the analytical surface displaying the real-time energy metrics that the Gate's monitoring system provided. The numbers were wrong. Not the numbers themselves — those were accurate, the precise measurements that the dimensional engineering instruments produced. The numbers were wrong relative to his calculations — the projected energy levels that his models had predicted based on the data he possessed.

The Gate was losing power faster than expected. The energy reservoir — the accumulated consciousness-energy that the ash-oath network fed into the dimensional portal — was draining at a rate that exceeded his calculations by a significant margin. The drain was not gradual — it was accelerating. Each hour produced a larger deficit than the previous one. The cascade that Amalura's intelligence had predicted was visible in the numbers: a feedback loop where each freed slave weakened the network's capacity to resist subsequent reversals.

Valdremor's corrupted calculations — the data that Amalura had deliberately sabotaged during the extraction — told him the Gate needed less energy than it actually did. The fifteen percent error meant that his threshold was already too low. Combined with the accelerating drain, the margin between the Gate's current energy level and the minimum required for activation was shrinking at a rate that his models couldn't explain.

He analyzed. The Architect's response to unexpected data was always analytical — the systematic evaluation that identified the cause and projected the consequence. The cause was clear: someone was reversing ash-oaths at a rate that exceeded anything his threat models had anticipated. The healer. The woman whose capability he had categorized as tactically significant but strategically secondary.

He had been wrong. The realization was delivered with the clinical precision that characterized all his self-assessments — the analytical mind evaluating its own performance and identifying the error. He had focused on the Sun-Blade as the primary threat — the weapon that could damage the Gate's dimensional structure. He had designed the corrosion spell to destroy it. He had celebrated the blade's shattering as a strategic victory.

But the blade was a sword. It could cut things. The healer was something else — a force that didn't destroy but reversed. The healer didn't attack the Gate's structure. She attacked its fuel supply. Every consciousness she freed was a unit of energy denied to the Gate. And unlike the blade — which required proximity and combat conditions to deploy — the healer could operate continuously, freed slave by freed slave, draining the Gate's reserves at a rate that no military defense could counter.

"She's more dangerous than the Sun-Blade," he said. The words were addressed to the empty study — the Architect speaking his assessment aloud, the verbalization that helped his analytical mind process conclusions that exceeded the complexity that silent thought could manage.

He deployed his ultimate counter. The decision was immediate — the strategic response that the threat's severity demanded. The response was not military. It was surgical. The healer had to be eliminated. Not captured — killed. The threat she represented was too immediate and too catastrophic for any response that left her alive and capable.

Mirathane. The name was filed in the Dominion's classified intelligence archive — the register of assets that the empire maintained for operations that conventional military forces couldn't execute. Mirathane was a specialist — the particular, rare category of operative that existed when a person's capabilities exceeded what training alone could produce and entered the territory that demon-bonding occupied.

She killed through reflections. The mirrorcraft technique — the demon-enhanced capability that converted every reflective surface into a portal and every portal into a weapon. She moved through mirrors — the dimensional transit that her demon-bond enabled, the ability to enter any reflective surface and emerge from any other within range. She struck from reflections — the attack that materialized from the surface of a mirror, a pool of water, a polished stone, any material that reflected light and that Mirathane's craft could weaponize.

She had never failed. The operational record that the intelligence archive maintained — the documented history of every mission that the assassin had been deployed for — contained no failures. Every target assigned to Mirathane had been eliminated. The record was perfect. The record was the reason she had been held in reserve — the asset too valuable for routine operations, preserved for the moment when the target's importance warranted the deployment of the Dominion's most effective killer.

That moment was now. The healer was the target. The mission was elimination.

Mirathane received her orders through the blood-mirror network — the encrypted transmission that Nightshade's communication infrastructure provided. The orders were brief. Clinical. The particular, minimal communication that assassination missions required — the target's identity, the operational parameters, the timeline.

Target: Neyla. Alliance healer. Ash-oath reversal specialist.

Mission: Eliminate. Lethal force authorized. No capture requirement.

Timeline: Immediate.

Mirathane didn't speak. The assassin's response was not verbal — the demon-bond that powered her mirrorcraft had long ago consumed the emotional infrastructure that speech required. She communicated through action. She nodded — the minimal gesture that acknowledged receipt and acceptance of the mission's parameters.

Then she stepped into a mirror and vanished.

The glass surface rippled — the particular, liquid distortion that the mirrorcraft transit produced. The reflection that the mirror had been displaying — the room, the wall, the ordinary visual information that mirrors reflected — dissolved. The surface became a portal. Mirathane's body passed through the glass the way a person passed through water — the solid barrier converting momentarily into a permeable medium that accepted the transiting body and then resolidifying behind it.

The mirror was empty. The room was empty. The assassin was gone — existing now in the Mirror-Realm, the fractured dimension of reflections that was her domain and her weapon and the space from which she would execute the mission that Valdremor had ordered.

The healer's death was approaching. The most dangerous person in the alliance — the woman whose compassion was a weapon and whose hands could drain the Gate's power one soul at a time — had been targeted by the most effective killer in the Dominion.

The mechanism was deployed. The counter was active. The assassin was hunting.

And the healer — somewhere to the south, somewhere in a liberated city, somewhere with turquoise light glowing from her hands and the words "I see you" on her lips — didn't know that the mirror on the wall was watching.
