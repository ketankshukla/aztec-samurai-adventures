Chapter 3 - THE FIRST STRIKE

The water bowl exploded and a blade made of light nearly took Neyla's head off.

She was healing in a liberated city — the fourth settlement that the army's advance had freed, the latest collection of ash-oath slaves who needed her hands and her turquoise light and the words that brought them back. The healing station was a converted market square — the open space that the city's commercial center provided, the tables and stalls repurposed as medical surfaces where the freed slaves could lie while the reversal's trauma worked through their systems.

Neyla was alone. The particular, dangerous aloneness that existed when a healer's focus on a patient consumed the awareness that should have been monitoring the environment. Her guards were twenty feet away — the security detail that Kaelen had assigned, the soldiers whose presence was supposed to prevent exactly the kind of attack that was about to occur.

The water bowl sat on the table beside her. A simple vessel — ceramic, filled with clean water, the medical supply that healing work required for cleaning wounds and mixing poultices and the hundred small tasks that medical practice demanded. The water's surface was still — the particular, mirror-like flatness that undisturbed water produced, the natural reflective quality that converted any pool of liquid into a surface that showed the viewer their own face.

The surface rippled. Not from vibration — from within. The water moved as though something beneath the surface was pressing upward, the liquid displaced by a force that existed not in the bowl but in the reflection that the water's surface contained.

Then the blade emerged. Razor-thin. Mirror-bright. The weapon materialized from the water's surface with the particular, impossible physics of an object transitioning from a reflected dimension into the physical world. The blade was not steel — it was light. Concentrated, focused, lethal light that the mirrorcraft technique converted from reflection into edge.

The blade passed within an inch of Neyla's throat. The margin between life and death was the distance that the healer's posture provided — the slight forward lean that her work on the patient required, the body position that moved her head an inch further from the water bowl than standing straight would have placed it.

One inch. The difference between Neyla alive and Neyla dead was one inch of forward lean.

The blade retracted. The weapon withdrew into the water's surface with the same impossible physics that had produced it — the mirror-bright edge dissolving back into the reflection, the water settling to its previous flatness as though the attack had never occurred. The surface was calm. The ceramic bowl was intact. The water was undisturbed.

No evidence. The attack had come and gone in less than a second, leaving no physical trace — no blade, no wound, no residue. Only the displaced air that Neyla felt against her neck — the whisper of a weapon that had passed close enough to disturb the atmosphere but not close enough to draw blood.

Neyla stumbled backward. The reaction was delayed — the body's emergency response activating after the threat had passed, the adrenaline flooding her system with the particular, sickening urgency that near-death experiences produced. Her hands shook. Her turquoise light surged — the magical response that her emotional state generated, the healing energy activating defensively in the absence of a wound to heal.

She was terrified. The particular, total terror that existed when a person understood that they had almost died and that the almost was measured in an inch. The terror was compounded by the incomprehension — the attack had come from a water bowl. From a reflection. From a surface that should have been as harmless as the water it contained.

The guards arrived. The security detail — responding to Neyla's stumble, to the disruption that the near-miss had produced in the healing station's routine. They found the healer standing ten feet from the table, staring at the water bowl, her face white and her hands trembling.

She reported to Itzil. The commander received the intelligence with the particular, focused intensity that assassination attempts against key personnel demanded. The report was clinical — Neyla's training converting the terror into the analytical language that intelligence required. Attack from a reflective surface. Blade materialized from the water's surface. No physical evidence. Retraction was instantaneous.

The team realized the implications immediately. Mirathane. The name existed in the intelligence files that Zariel's network had accumulated — the classified Dominion asset, the mirror-realm assassin whose capabilities included the ability to strike from any reflective surface.

Any reflective surface was a threat. The recognition cascaded through the team's tactical planning with the devastating speed that existential threats produced. Mirrors. Water. Polished metal. Wet stone. Glass. Any material that reflected light was a potential portal — a surface from which a lethal blade could emerge without warning and retract without evidence.

Kaelen ordered a sweep. The scout's response was immediate — the security protocol that the threat demanded. Every mirror in the army's camp was smashed. Every water barrel was covered with opaque cloth. Every polished metal surface was dulled — armor, weapons, cooking implements, the hundred items that military populations carried and that reflected light.

The army looked paranoid. The particular, excessive security response that an invisible, omnipresent threat produced — the camp converting from a military installation into a space where every reflective surface was treated as a weapon. Soldiers covered their belt buckles. Officers dulled their insignia. The water distribution system was redesigned to eliminate open containers.

They were paranoid. The paranoia was rational — the appropriate response to a threat that could materialize from any surface that reflected light and that had demonstrated its capability by nearly killing the alliance's most strategically important non-combat asset.

That night, Neyla couldn't sleep. The tent was dark — the lamp extinguished, the surfaces that might reflect its light eliminated by the security sweep that Kaelen's order had produced. The darkness was supposed to be safe — the absence of light preventing the reflections that Mirathane's craft required.

But the darkness was not comforting. Every shadow might contain a blade. Every surface might produce the mirror-bright edge that had passed within an inch of her throat. The particular, devastating insecurity that Mirathane's attack had created — the conversion of the environment from neutral to hostile, the weaponization of the ordinary surfaces that surrounded every person at every moment.

Mirathane had weaponized Neyla's world. The water that the healer used for her work. The polished surfaces that existed in every human environment. The reflections that were so ubiquitous that most people never noticed them. All of it was now a threat. All of it was now a portal through which death could arrive without warning.

The healer lay in the dark. The turquoise light was extinguished — the magical energy conserved for the morning's work, the healing that the campaign demanded regardless of the assassin that hunted. The fear was present. The determination was stronger.

She would heal tomorrow. She would free more slaves. She would drain more power from the Gate. The assassin was hunting her. The assassin had nearly killed her. The assassin would try again.

Neyla would be there when the assassin tried. Because being there was what she did. Because the people who needed her hands and her light and her words were more important than the fear that Mirathane had planted.

The healer slept. Eventually. The fear a companion in the dark.

And somewhere in the Mirror-Realm — in the fractured dimension of reflections where physics was suggestion and geometry was a weapon — Mirathane watched. Through a dewdrop on the tent's canvas. Through the moisture in the healer's breath. Through every surface that held even a trace of reflection.

Watching. Waiting. Planning the next strike.
