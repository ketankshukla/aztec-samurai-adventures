Chapter 4 - MIRATHANE'S WORLD

Mirathane existed in the space between reflections, and the space was beautiful and broken and entirely hers.

The Mirror-Realm was not a place in the way that physical locations were places. It was a dimension — a parallel layer of reality where every reflective surface in the physical world produced a corresponding surface here, and where the images that those surfaces reflected had substance and weight and the particular, tangible quality of things that could be touched and manipulated and weaponized.

The realm looked like a shattered glass mosaic. The visual field was fragmented — the world rendered in thousands of reflective panels, each one showing a different angle of the physical world that existed on the other side of the glass. The panels shifted. They rotated. They reflected each other in infinite recursions that produced the vertiginous, recursive depth that existed when mirrors faced mirrors and the reflections went on forever.

Mirathane moved through this space the way a spider moved through a web — with the particular, intimate knowledge of a creature that had built its environment and that understood every strand and junction and the particular physics that governed movement within the structure.

She was cold. The descriptor was not metaphorical — the Mirror-Realm's temperature existed at a constant that was lower than the physical world, the dimensional characteristic that the fractured space maintained regardless of the conditions on the other side. The coldness was also internal — the emotional state that the demon-bond had produced, the systematic replacement of human feeling with the geometric certainty that the bond's magic installed.

She was precise. Every movement was calculated — the particular, mechanical efficiency that the demon-bond provided, the conversion of physical capability into the optimized performance that demonic enhancement produced. Her body moved without wasted motion. Her perception processed information without emotional filtering. Her decisions were produced by calculation rather than feeling.

She was barely human. The descriptor was accurate — the demon-bond that powered her mirrorcraft had consumed the emotional infrastructure that humanity required. She didn't hate. She didn't love. She didn't fear. The bond had replaced these with the equivalent functions that its design provided: target identification replaced hatred, mission parameters replaced love, risk assessment replaced fear.

She didn't hate the healer. The target — Neyla, alliance healer, ash-oath reversal specialist — was a variable in an equation. The equation's solution required the variable's elimination. The elimination was not personal. It was mathematical. The particular, cold logic that the demon-bond installed in every assessment and every decision.

She watched Neyla through every reflective surface in the army's camp. The surveillance was comprehensive — the Mirror-Realm's connection to the physical world providing a monitoring capability that exceeded any conventional intelligence apparatus. Every reflective surface was a window. Every window was Mirathane's eye.

A dewdrop on a tent's canvas. The particular, small reflective surface that morning moisture produced — the water droplet that caught the dawn light and that, from the Mirror-Realm's perspective, provided a clear view of the tent's interior and the healer who slept within it.

A soldier's belt buckle. The polished metal that military equipment contained — the reflective surface that the security sweep had attempted to dull but that the ubiquity of metal in a military camp made impossible to eliminate entirely. The buckle provided a view of the camp's central area — the space where the healer worked and where the targets of opportunity that the mission required were most likely to present themselves.

A bead of sweat on a guard's forehead. The particular, microscopic reflective surface that the human body produced — the moisture that exertion generated and that, from the Mirror-Realm's perspective, provided a view that was as clear and as useful as a full-sized mirror. The guard stood at the healing station's perimeter. The sweat on his forehead showed Mirathane everything she needed to see.

She cataloged Neyla's patterns. The systematic intelligence collection that the mission's planning phase required — the documentation of the target's routine, the identification of vulnerabilities, the construction of the operational model that would determine the timing and method of the kill.

Where she sleeps: the medical tent, third row from the command center, eastern side of the camp. The tent is dark — no lamp, no reflective surfaces. The security sweep has been thorough inside the tent. Approach via tent surfaces limited to condensation and ambient moisture.

When she heals: morning to evening, continuous, the liberation campaign's demands consuming the daylight hours. The healing occurs in open spaces — market squares, temple courtyards, any area large enough to accommodate the freed slaves and the medical infrastructure that the reversals require.

Who guards her: a rotating detail of four soldiers, supplemented by the periodic presence of the scout — Kaelen — whose perceptual capabilities include the ability to detect light distortions that mirror-transit produces. The scout is the primary defensive threat. His presence near the target must be factored into the kill-shot's timing.

Mirathane built the kill-shot. The operational plan that the collected intelligence produced — the specific method, timing, and approach that would eliminate the target with the precision that her demon-bond demanded.

Tomorrow. Neyla would heal in the next city's town square — the settlement that the army's advance was approaching. The town square contained a fountain. The fountain contained still water. Still water was a perfect mirror — the reflective surface that provided the clearest, most stable portal that mirrorcraft could use.

She would strike from beneath the surface. The attack would emerge from the fountain's water — the blade materializing from the still surface with the speed and precision that the demon-bond guaranteed. The angle would target the healer's spine — the lethal strike that prevented the turquoise light from activating in the moment between attack and death.

The plan was complete. The variables were assessed. The calculation was solved. The equation's solution was the healer's death.

Mirathane settled into the Mirror-Realm's fractured landscape. The cold surrounded her. The precision sustained her. The barely-human awareness that the demon-bond maintained processed the plan's parameters one final time and confirmed: the solution was optimal.

Tomorrow. The fountain. The still water.

The healer would die. The equation demanded it. The assassin would execute it.

Because execution was what she was. Not a person. Not a feeling. An equation with a blade.

And equations didn't hesitate.
