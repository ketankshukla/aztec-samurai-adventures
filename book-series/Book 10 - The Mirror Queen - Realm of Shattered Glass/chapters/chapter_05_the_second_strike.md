Chapter 5 - THE SECOND STRIKE

Kaelen saw the distortion before the blade emerged, and the half-second warning saved Neyla's life for the second time.

The scout had positioned himself near the healer — the protective proximity that the first assassination attempt had demanded. His placement was deliberate — not beside Neyla, where his presence would interfere with the healing work, but at the town square's perimeter, where his shadow-sense could monitor every surface within the attack's likely range.

The shadow-sense was Miyako's gift. The perceptual technique that the shadow master had taught him — the ability to detect distortions in light, the subtle changes that occurred when a reflective surface was being manipulated from the Mirror-Realm. The distortion was not visible to normal perception — it existed at the threshold between light and shadow, the particular, minute alteration that mirrorcraft transit produced in the light that a surface reflected.

Kaelen could see it. The training that Miyako had embedded in his perception detected the alteration the way a jeweler detected a flaw in a diamond — the particular, trained sensitivity that identified the aberration against the baseline of normal light behavior.

Neyla was healing in the town square. The next settlement — the fifth that the liberation campaign had reached, the latest collection of ash-oath slaves who needed the healer's hands. The square was open — the commercial center that the settlement's architecture provided, the space where the freed slaves lay on improvised surfaces while Neyla's turquoise light restored their consciousness.

The fountain was present. The central water feature that the square's design included — the decorative structure that provided the still water surface that Mirathane had identified as her approach vector. The fountain was covered — a tarp stretched across the water's surface, Kaelen's order, the physical barrier that prevented the still water from serving as the mirror that the assassin needed.

The tarp blocked the approach. Mirathane's planned attack — the strike from beneath the fountain's still surface — was prevented by the opaque barrier that eliminated the reflective quality the mirrorcraft required. The assassin's angle was blocked. The kill-shot was denied.

Mirathane adapted. The adaptation was instantaneous — the demon-bond's processing speed converting the blocked approach into an alternative vector in the fraction of a second that the transition between plans required. The fountain was blocked. Another surface was available.

A polished stone in the courtyard floor. The paving material that the square's construction had used — the particular, smooth stone that centuries of foot traffic had polished to a reflective sheen. The stone was not a mirror — the reflection it produced was dim, distorted, the faint image that polished rock generated rather than the clear image that still water provided. But the reflection existed. The surface was usable. The attack was viable.

A blade erupted from the stone's surface. The weapon materialized from the courtyard floor — the mirror-bright edge emerging from the polished stone with the speed that the demon-bond's enhancement provided. The blade was aimed at Neyla's back — the lethal trajectory that the spine-strike required, the attack designed to kill before the target could activate the defensive magic that survival demanded.

Kaelen intercepted. The scout's thrown blade — the steel knife that his combat loadout included, the weapon that his training had made into a projectile as accurate as any archer's arrow — was in the air before the mirror-blade had fully materialized. The throw was reactive — the response that the half-second warning provided, the particular, trained reflex that converted detection into action without the conscious processing that deliberate response required.

The thrown blade deflected the mirror-strike. The steel met the mirror-bright edge at the intersection point that Kaelen's aim had calculated — the contact that redirected the assassin's weapon from its lethal trajectory into the empty air beside Neyla's body. The deflection was not a block — the mirror-blade's dimensional material was harder than steel. It was a redirect — the thrown knife's impact altering the mirror-blade's angle by the margin that converted a lethal strike into a near-miss.

The assassin's weapon shattered against Kaelen's steel. The mirror-bright blade — the dimensional construct that Mirathane's craft had produced — fragmented on contact with the thrown knife. The fragments dissolved — the dimensional material losing coherence once separated from the portal that had produced it, the shards evaporating into the light that they were made of.

Mirathane retreated. The assassin withdrew into the stone — the mirror-transit that converted the polished surface into a portal and pulled the attacker back into the Mirror-Realm. The withdrawal was instantaneous — the stone's surface rippling for a fraction of a second and then settling to its normal, inert state.

Kaelen followed with his eyes. The scout's perception — the shadow-sense that detected mirror-transit distortions — tracked the withdrawal. He could see the distortion in the stone's reflection — the particular, fading signature that Mirathane's retreat produced. The signature was brief. Almost invisible. But not quite.

"She's adapting," Kaelen said. The assessment was delivered to Itzil — the commander who had arrived at the town square in response to the attack's aftermath, the leader whose tactical decisions would determine how the assassin threat was addressed.

"We need a different approach," he continued. "We can't just block surfaces — there are too many. Every polished stone, every drop of water, every piece of metal in the army. We can't eliminate every reflection in the world."

"Then we go to her," Itzil said. The decision was immediate — the commander's response to a threat that couldn't be defended against by conventional means. "Into the Mirror-Realm."

The statement was simple. The implication was enormous — the proposal to enter the assassin's domain, to fight Mirathane in the dimension she controlled, to carry the battle to the enemy rather than waiting for the enemy to bring it to them.

The proposal was insane. The Mirror-Realm was Mirathane's territory — the fractured dimension where she moved like a spider in its web, where the physics served her capabilities and the geometry was her weapon. Entering her domain was entering a killing ground that she had spent a lifetime learning to control.

But the alternative was worse. The alternative was an army that couldn't use water, that couldn't tolerate polished surfaces, that lived in constant terror of an attack that could come from any reflection at any moment. The alternative was a healer who couldn't work because every surface near her was a potential portal for the blade that would kill her.

The alternative was unacceptable. The insanity of entering the Mirror-Realm was preferable to the insanity of living in a world where every reflection was a weapon.

"Into the Mirror-Realm," Itzil said again. The repetition was confirmation — the commander committing to the plan with the particular, absolute authority that her decisions carried.

The team would take the fight to the assassin. They would enter Mirathane's domain. They would fight her in the dimension she controlled.

And they would win. Because winning was what they did. Even when winning required entering a shattered glass dimension where reality was fractured and the enemy was home.

The insanity was acceptable. The alternative was not.
