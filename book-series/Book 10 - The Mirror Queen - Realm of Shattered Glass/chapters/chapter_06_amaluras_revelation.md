Chapter 6 - AMALURA'S REVELATION

Amalura explained the Mirror-Realm to the team and the explanation made the impossible sound worse.

The war council convened in the command tent — the stone table that held maps and intelligence products now holding the scholar's diagrams of dimensional architecture. Amalura stood at the table's center — the position that her expertise demanded, the placement that converted the tent from a military briefing room into a classroom where the most important lesson of the war was being delivered.

"The Mirror-Realm is a parallel dimension," she said. Her delivery was clinical — the scholar's lecture mode, the particular tone that converted complex information into comprehensible instruction. "Every reflective surface in our world produces a corresponding surface there. The reflections have substance — they can be touched, manipulated, weaponized. Mirathane lives in that space. She controls it the way we control our physical environment."

She drew diagrams. The scholarly illustrations that her training produced — the visual representations of dimensional architecture that converted abstract concepts into spatial relationships that non-scholars could understand. The diagrams showed the Mirror-Realm as a fractal space — the infinite recursion of reflections producing a dimension that was simultaneously bounded and endless.

"The Mirror-Realm is also where the ash-oath souls are stored." The revelation produced the particular, charged silence that new intelligence generated in a room full of people who understood its implications. "The consciousness that the ash-oaths extract — the souls that power the Gate — are trapped in the Mirror-Realm. Stored in mirror-cells. Thousands of them. Slowly being consumed by the dimensional energy that the Gate's operation requires."

The implication was devastating and hopeful simultaneously. The souls were there — the stolen consciousnesses that the liberation campaign was fighting to recover. They were trapped in a dimension that could be entered. They could potentially be freed — not one at a time, through the painstaking reversal process that Neyla performed in the physical world, but en masse, through direct intervention in the dimension where they were held.

"Entering the Mirror-Realm requires specific magic," Amalura continued. "Or a powerful enough connection to the souls inside." She looked at Neyla. The scholar's gaze was direct — the assessment of capability that her analytical mind performed automatically. "Neyla has that connection. Her healing magic links her to every ash-oath she's broken. The link is dimensional — it exists not just in the physical world but in the Mirror-Realm, where the souls are stored. She can use that link as a pathway."

The plan took shape. The particular, audacious operational concept that the intelligence suggested and that the team's capabilities could potentially execute.

Neyla enters the Mirror-Realm with an escort. She frees the trapped souls en masse — the direct liberation that her dimensional connection enables. The mass liberation drains the Gate's energy supply catastrophically — not the incremental drain that the physical-world campaign produces but a massive, sudden depletion that could collapse the Gate's power infrastructure.

Meanwhile, the escort fights Mirathane in her own domain. The assassin would not permit intruders to operate in the Mirror-Realm unchallenged. The escort's role was to engage Mirathane — to occupy the assassin's attention and combat capability while Neyla performed the liberation that the mission required.

"The risk is significant," Amalura said. The honest assessment that the scholar's integrity demanded — the acknowledgment of danger that accompanied the presentation of opportunity. "The Mirror-Realm distorts perception. Reality is fractured — up is down, distance is unreliable, time behaves differently. Mirathane controls it like a spider controls a web. She can reshape the space around you. She can attack from any direction simultaneously. She can fragment herself across multiple surfaces."

The risks were not abstract. They were specific — the particular, lethal challenges that the Mirror-Realm's physics produced for intruders who were not adapted to its environment.

"You'll be blind and lost," Amalura said. "She'll be at home. The only advantage you have is something she doesn't understand: compassion. She can't see soul-threads — the connections between living beings that Neyla's healing magic perceives. In the Mirror-Realm, those threads are visible. They're your navigation system. Neyla can follow them to the trapped souls. Mirathane can't follow them at all."

The advantage was narrow. A single capability that the assassin lacked — the perception of soul-connections that Neyla's healing magic provided. In a dimension where every other advantage belonged to the enemy, the healer's compassion was the one thing that the assassin's geometric certainty couldn't match.

Neyla volunteered. The decision was immediate — no hesitation, no deliberation, the particular, absolute response that existed when a person heard the description of a mission that aligned with their deepest purpose and recognized it as the thing they were meant to do.

"Those souls are trapped because of me," she said. The statement was not accurate — the souls were trapped because of the Dominion's ash-oath system, not because of Neyla's inability to free them fast enough. But the emotional logic was valid — the healer's sense of responsibility for the people she couldn't reach, the guilt that drove the compassion that was simultaneously her burden and her weapon.

"I couldn't free them fast enough," she said. "I'm going in."

"Not alone," Itzil said. The commander's response was immediate — the refusal to permit a solo operation that the mission's danger precluded.

Rainara stepped forward. The water-mystic's volunteering was as immediate as Neyla's — the response that existed when a person's capability matched a mission's requirements and the person recognized the match without needing to be told.

"I'm coming," Rainara said. "Water and mirrors are cousins. I speak both languages."

The statement was characteristically Rainara — the compressed, powerful declaration that communicated capability and commitment simultaneously. Water and mirrors — the two substances that shared the quality of reflection, the materials that existed at the intersection of the physical and the dimensional.

Rainara's water-magic would function in the Mirror-Realm. The element that she controlled was related to the dimension's fundamental substance — the reflective quality that mirrors and water shared providing the commonality that would allow her magic to operate in an environment where most conventional capabilities would fail.

The team was set. Neyla and Rainara — the healer and the water-mystic, the compassion and the fury, the turquoise light and the silver power. Two people entering a dimension controlled by an assassin whose capabilities exceeded anything they had faced.

The mission was insane. The mission was necessary. The mission was what they did.

"When?" Neyla asked.

"Tomorrow," Amalura said. "The longer we wait, the more souls the Gate consumes. And the stronger Mirathane becomes in her domain."

Tomorrow. The Mirror-Realm. The fractured dimension of reflections where reality was broken and the assassin was home.

Neyla looked at Rainara. The healer and the water-mystic — two women who had been through the breaking and had chosen to keep fighting.

"Ready?" Neyla asked.

Rainara's answer was a nod. The minimal gesture that communicated maximum commitment.

They were ready. As ready as anyone could be for a mission into a shattered glass dimension where the enemy controlled the physics and the only advantage was the ability to see the connections between souls.

Tomorrow. The Mirror-Realm waited.

And in the fractured space between reflections, Mirathane felt the approach of something she didn't understand — a warmth that her geometric certainty couldn't calculate, a light that her mirror-sight couldn't categorize.

Compassion was coming. And the assassin who had never failed was about to face the one thing her equations couldn't solve.
