Chapter 7 - ENTERING THE MIRROR

Neyla touched the water and fell through the world.

The entry point was a large, still pool in a temple courtyard — the sacred water feature that the liberated city's religious architecture provided. The pool was ten feet across — the circular basin that temple design prescribed, the contained water that centuries of worship had maintained. Rainara held the water perfectly still — the water-mystic's magic imposing the absolute flatness that converted the pool's surface from water into mirror.

The surface was glass-smooth. The reflection was perfect — the sky above rendered in the water's surface with the particular, flawless clarity that still water produced when no vibration disturbed it. Neyla's face looked back at her from the pool — the reflection that was simultaneously herself and the portal that would take her to the dimension where the stolen souls were held.

She knelt at the pool's edge. The team surrounded the courtyard — Kaelen at the perimeter, Itzil at the command position, the security detail that the operation's importance demanded. But the entry was Neyla's alone. The healer's connection to the trapped souls was the pathway — the dimensional link that her healing magic provided and that no one else possessed.

She touched the surface. Her fingers met the water — and passed through. Not into liquid but into something else. The surface yielded — not with the resistance of water but with the particular, yielding quality of a barrier that was designed to be crossed by someone with the right key. Neyla's healing magic was the key. The turquoise light that her fingers produced interacted with the reflective surface and the surface opened.

She fell through. The transition was not violent — not the dramatic plunge that physical falling produced. It was a sliding — the body moving from one dimensional state to another with the smooth, continuous motion that dimensional transit provided when the transit was authorized rather than forced. The physical world dissolved. The temple courtyard, the sky, the faces of her friends — all of it faded, replaced by the dimension that existed on the other side of every reflection.

The Mirror-Realm was beautiful and horrifying.

Everything was reflected. The visual field was composed entirely of reflective surfaces — walls of glass, floors of polished crystal, ceilings that mirrored the ground beneath them. Every surface showed something — the physical world rendered in fragments, the particular, fractured view that existed when reality was seen through thousands of separate mirrors simultaneously.

She saw herself from a thousand angles. Every reflective surface contained her image — the healer's turquoise light reproduced in infinite copies, each one slightly different, the angles and distances producing the variations that multiple perspectives generated. The effect was vertiginous — the cognitive overload that existed when a person's visual field contained a thousand versions of themselves and the brain attempted to process which one was real.

The sky was made of shattered glass. The dimension's upper boundary — the equivalent of the physical world's atmosphere — was a mosaic of reflective fragments. Each fragment showed a different piece of the physical sky — a star here, a cloud there, the fissure's red light in another. The composite was a sky assembled from broken pieces — the particular, devastating beauty of something that was simultaneously destroyed and complete.

The ground shifted. The floor of the Mirror-Realm was not stable — the reflective surfaces that composed it moved, tilted, rearranged themselves with the particular, continuous adjustment that a dimension in flux produced. Walking required constant adaptation — the body adjusting to a surface that changed its angle and elevation with every step.

Rainara arrived beside her. The water-mystic's entry was different — she didn't fall through the surface. She slid through it — the water-magic that controlled the pool's surface extending into the pool itself, Rainara's body transitioning from the physical world to the Mirror-Realm by moving through her element. She surfaced in the Mirror-Realm the way she would surface from a dive — emerging from below, the water that accompanied her forming a protective shell that maintained her orientation in the disorienting space.

Rainara's water-magic worked here. The element responded — not the same way it responded in the physical world, but functionally. The water that Rainara controlled could interact with the mirror-surfaces — reshaping them, warping them, creating paths through the fractured landscape that the fixed geometry of the realm didn't provide.

"Water and mirrors are cousins," Rainara said. The confirmation of her earlier claim — the capability assessment validated by the environment's response. She could work here. She could fight here. The water-magic that the Dominion had dismissed as a non-threat in the physical world was functional in the dimension where the Dominion's most dangerous assassin lived.

They moved forward. Neyla navigated — the healer's perception providing the guidance that the disorienting environment demanded. The soul-threads were visible here. The connections between living beings — the golden lines that connected every conscious entity to every other — were tangible in the Mirror-Realm. Neyla could see them — the threads that linked the trapped souls to their physical bodies, the connections that the ash-oaths had stretched across dimensions but hadn't severed.

The threads were a map. Each one led from a trapped soul's mirror-cell to the physical world where the soul's body existed. Neyla followed the threads — the healer's perception converting the chaotic, disorienting Mirror-Realm into a navigable space that the soul-connections mapped.

Then they saw the trapped souls.

Thousands of flickering figures. Imprisoned in mirror-cells — the individual containment units that the ash-oath system used to store the stolen consciousnesses. Each cell was a mirror — a reflective surface that contained a human soul in the space between its surface and its reflection. The souls were visible — translucent figures pressing against the glass, their mouths open in silent screams, their hands flat against the barriers that held them.

The sight was devastating. Thousands of people — the stolen consciousnesses that the Dominion's infrastructure consumed — trapped in individual mirrors, each one a person, each one aware, each one screaming without sound in a dimension where no one could hear them.

Neyla reached out to the nearest soul. Her hand touched the mirror-cell — the turquoise light connecting with the reflective surface that contained the stolen consciousness. The healing magic interacted with the ash-oath's dimensional binding — the turquoise energy disrupting the mechanism that held the soul in the mirror-cell.

The mirror cracked. The surface that contained the soul fractured — the lines spreading from the point where Neyla's healing magic had contacted it, the structural failure that the disruption produced. The crack widened. The mirror-cell's containment failed.

The soul began to emerge. The translucent figure — the stolen consciousness that had been trapped in the reflective space — pressed through the crack, the dimensional binding releasing its hold as the healing magic dissolved the mechanism that maintained it.

"I see you," Neyla said. The words that she had spoken to every freed slave — the particular, essential declaration that converted a medical procedure into a human connection. "I'm here. You're going home."

The soul emerged. The figure solidified — the translucent quality fading, the consciousness regaining the coherence that the ash-oath had suppressed. The soul looked at Neyla — the first person it had seen since the binding, the first face that wasn't its own reflection.

The gratitude was silent. The soul couldn't speak — the Mirror-Realm's physics didn't support the acoustic communication that the physical world provided. But the expression was visible — the particular, devastating gratitude of a person who had been imprisoned and who was being freed by someone who had come into the prison to find them.

One soul freed. Thousands remaining.

Neyla moved to the next cell. The turquoise light was steady — the healer's energy sustained by the purpose that the mission provided. The purpose was clear. The path was mapped. The work was essential.

She would free them. One at a time if necessary. But the cascade that Amalura had described — the chain reaction where each freed soul's energy helped free the next — was available here. In the Mirror-Realm, closer to the source, the cascade would be faster. Stronger. More devastating to the Gate.

The liberation had begun. The healer was in the prison. The water-mystic was beside her.

And somewhere in the fractured dimension — somewhere in the infinite recursion of reflections that the Mirror-Realm contained — the assassin felt the intrusion and began to move.
