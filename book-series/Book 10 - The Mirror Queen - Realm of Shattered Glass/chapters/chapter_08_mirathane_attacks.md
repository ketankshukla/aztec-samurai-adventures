Chapter 8 - MIRATHANE ATTACKS

Mirathane materialized from a mirror-wall like a figure stepping out of shattered light, and Rainara was the one who stood between her and the healer.

The assassin detected the intruders the moment they freed the first soul. The Mirror-Realm was her domain — the dimensional space that her demon-bond connected her to, the environment whose every change registered in her consciousness the way a spider felt vibrations in its web. The crack in the mirror-cell — the fracture that Neyla's healing magic had produced — sent a tremor through the entire dimension. The tremor told Mirathane everything: location, number of intruders, method of entry.

She materialized from the wall nearest to the intruders — the mirror-surface dissolving around her body as she transitioned from the dimension's background into its foreground. She was a figure of fractured light — her body composed of the reflective material that the Mirror-Realm provided, her form simultaneously solid and translucent, the particular quality of a person who existed in a dimension of reflections and who was made of the same substance as her environment.

A blade in each hand. The weapons were mirror-craft constructs — the same razor-thin, mirror-bright edges that had attacked Neyla in the physical world, here manifested at full power. In the physical world, the blades were limited by the portal's constraints — the size of the reflective surface, the distance from the Mirror-Realm to the physical plane. Here, in her domain, the blades were unrestricted. Full-length. Full-power. The weapons of an assassin operating at maximum capability in the environment that maximized her capability.

She was terrifying here. The movement was not human — not the physical displacement that muscles and joints produced. She moved like a reflection — instantaneous, flowing from surface to surface with the particular, impossible speed that the Mirror-Realm's physics permitted. She could be in one place and then in another without traversing the space between. She could attack from any direction simultaneously because she WAS the mirrors — her consciousness distributed across the reflective surfaces, her body materializing from whatever surface was closest to her target.

Rainara met her. The water-mystic stepped between Mirathane and Neyla with the particular, fierce determination that had been her signature since the dehydration cell. The positioning was immediate — the protective instinct that placed the fighter between the threat and the person being protected.

Water vs. mirrors. The elemental opposition that existed when two substances that shared the quality of reflection were wielded by practitioners with incompatible intentions. Rainara's water-magic interacted with the mirror-surfaces — the water flooding across the reflective glass, warping the geometry that Mirathane used to move.

The effect was dramatic. The mirror-surfaces that Rainara's water touched became unreliable — the reflections distorted, the portal quality degraded. Mirathane's movement depended on clear reflections — the precise, undistorted images that her consciousness used to navigate between surfaces. Rainara's water converted clear reflections into warped, imprecise images that the assassin's transit couldn't use reliably.

Mirathane tried to step through a mirror. The transit that should have been instantaneous was disrupted — the water-warped surface producing an incomplete portal that the assassin hit like a wall rather than passed through like a door. The impact was visible — Mirathane's form stuttering, the fractured-light body losing coherence momentarily as the failed transit disrupted her dimensional stability.

The combat was surreal. Fought in a dimension where physics was suggestion and geometry was a weapon — the particular, impossible engagement that occurred when two practitioners whose capabilities operated on different fundamental principles collided in a space that neither fully controlled.

Rainara shattered mirror-walls with water pressure. The water-mystic's offensive capability — the concentrated force that months of combat had refined — deployed in the Mirror-Realm as pressurized jets that struck the reflective surfaces with sufficient force to crack and collapse them. Each shattered wall was a movement option eliminated — a portal that Mirathane could no longer use, a surface that the assassin could no longer transit through.

The shattering was strategic. Rainara wasn't attacking randomly — she was collapsing Mirathane's movement infrastructure systematically. The water-mystic's understanding of the Mirror-Realm's geometry — the intuitive comprehension that "water and mirrors are cousins" provided — allowed her to identify the key surfaces that Mirathane's movement patterns depended on. Destroy those surfaces, and the assassin's infinite mobility became finite. Contained. Manageable.

Mirathane was forced to fight on Rainara's terms. The assassin — whose combat philosophy depended on infinite mobility, on the ability to strike from any direction and retreat to any surface — was being compressed into a space where the mobility was constrained and the engagement was direct. Physical. The kind of fight that Mirathane's demon-bond hadn't been designed for.

The assassin adapted. The demon-bond's processing speed produced the tactical adjustment that the changing conditions demanded — the conversion from mobility-dependent combat to the alternative that the constrained space required.

She fragmented herself. The technique was the Mirror-Realm's most devastating offensive capability — the division of a single consciousness across multiple reflective surfaces simultaneously. Twelve reflections appeared — twelve copies of Mirathane, each one manifested from a different mirror-surface, each one holding mirror-blades, each one capable of independent attack.

Twelve assassins. Each one a reflection. Each one lethal.

Rainara faced a hall of assassins. The twelve reflections surrounded her — the encirclement that the fragmentation technique produced, the combat scenario that no single fighter could address because no single fighter could defend against twelve simultaneous attacks from twelve directions.

"Oh, so that's how you play," Rainara said. The words were delivered with the particular, fierce energy that the water-mystic produced when a challenge exceeded her expectations and her response exceeded the challenge.

She pulled water from EVERY surface at once. The technique was the water-magic equivalent of Mirathane's fragmentation — the distribution of capability across the entire available environment simultaneously. Water flowed from every mirror-surface in the surrounding space — the moisture that the Mirror-Realm's dimensional structure contained, drawn outward by Rainara's will and concentrated into a sphere of liquid that surrounded the water-mystic's position.

The sphere distorted every mirror. The water's presence on the reflective surfaces warped every reflection in the space — the twelve copies of Mirathane blurring, their forms losing the coherence that clear reflections maintained. The fragmentation depended on clear mirrors. Rainara's sphere eliminated clear mirrors.

The reflections blurred. Mirathane screamed — the first sound the assassin had produced, the involuntary response that existed when a consciousness distributed across twelve surfaces experienced the simultaneous disruption of all twelve. The scream was dimensional — it resonated through the Mirror-Realm's structure, the sound of a person whose existence was being challenged by an element that her demon-bond couldn't counter.

The twelve reflections collapsed into one. The fragmentation failed — the distorted mirrors unable to sustain the multiple copies that the technique required. Mirathane reformed — a single figure, fractured and furious, the demon-bond's cold certainty cracking under the pressure of an opponent who could challenge her in her own domain.

Rainara stood in the center of her water-sphere. The liquid surrounded her — a protective barrier and an offensive weapon simultaneously, the element that was her gift and her identity deployed at maximum capability in the dimension where it was most effective.

"Your move," she said.

And behind the water-mystic — protected by the water-sphere's distortion field, invisible to Mirathane's mirror-sight — Neyla continued freeing souls.
