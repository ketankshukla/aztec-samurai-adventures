Chapter 13 - THE GATE WEAKENS

The effect was immediate and the alliance felt it like a weight lifting from the world's shoulders.

The Starless Crown stuttered. The void that had been consuming stars — the ring of darkness that had been growing since Book 4, the dimensional distortion that had become the visual signature of the Dominion's power — faltered. The steady, accelerating expansion that had characterized the Crown's progression for months was interrupted. The void's advance slowed. Stopped. The stars at the Crown's edge — the ones that had been moments from consumption — held. Brightened. Persisted.

The fissure above the Dominion capital narrowed. The crack in the barrier — the dimensional stress fracture through which Vastrix's red light had been flooding — contracted. Not closing — the energy drain was not yet sufficient to reverse the damage that the Gate's operation had produced. But narrowing — the width decreasing from fifty yards to forty, the red light's intensity diminishing from flood to flow.

Vastrix's psychic pressure lessened. The entity — the ocean of hunger that had been pressing against the barrier with the patient, immense force of something that had been waiting for three thousand years — detected the change and responded with the particular, frustrated reduction in output that existed when a force encountered unexpected resistance. The pressure was not gone. But it was reduced. The crushing weight that had been driving soldiers to their knees and civilians to despair was now the heavy weight that trained warriors could endure and function under.

The allied army felt it. The shift was physical — the particular, measurable change in the body's response to the psychic environment that the reduced pressure produced. Soldiers stood taller. Their breathing deepened. The particular, constrained posture that the crushing pressure had imposed — the hunched shoulders, the bowed heads, the defensive body language of people enduring a weight they couldn't see — relaxed. Not fully — the pressure was still present, still heavy. But the relaxation was visible. The army was recovering from the psychic assault that had been grinding it down for weeks.

Itzil stood at the command position — the elevated terrain that provided visual contact with the army's formations and the Dominion capital's defenses. The reforged blade blazed at her hip — the nine-colored light intensified by the Gate's weakening, the soul-threads resonating with the dimensional shift that the mass liberation had produced.

The blade felt different. The weapon's energy — the combined soul-contribution of nine heroes — was responding to the Gate's distress with the particular, amplified output that existed when the dimensional system that the blade was designed to affect was experiencing the conditions that the blade's design addressed. The blade was keyed to the barrier. The barrier was responding to the Gate's weakening. The blade's response was sympathetic — the weapon's energy increasing as the system it was connected to changed.

Reports confirmed the strategic picture. Skyren's aerial reconnaissance showed the Dominion capital's defenses in disarray — the garrison that had been reinforced for the alliance's approach was now dealing with the internal consequences of the ash-oath network's disruption. Soldiers who had been bound by oaths were waking up. Commanders who had relied on slave-soldiers were discovering that their forces were melting away. The Dominion's military capability was diminishing as the consciousness that powered it was being restored to the people it had been stolen from.

Amalura calculated the energy levels. The scholar's analytical mind processed the data that the Gate's monitoring system produced — the numbers that quantified the dimensional portal's power state. The Gate's energy reserves had dropped by approximately thirty percent since the Mirror-Realm operation. The drop was catastrophic — the system that Valdremor had been feeding at maximum rate was now losing energy faster than the remaining ash-oath facilities could replace it.

"The threshold failure is approaching," Amalura said. The assessment was delivered with the clinical precision that the scholar's analysis demanded. "Valdremor's activation attempt — based on his corrupted calculations — will occur when his instruments tell him the energy level has reached the threshold. But his threshold is wrong. The actual threshold is fifteen percent higher than what he believes. He'll attempt activation. The activation will fail. The failure will consume energy. The window will open."

The window. The period between Valdremor's failed activation attempt and his ability to rebuild the energy reserves for a second attempt. The opportunity that the alliance's offensive needed — the gap in the Gate's operation that would allow the army to reach the dimensional portal and the bearer to use the blade.

"How long?" Itzil asked.

"Hours. Based on the current drain rate and the energy that the failed activation will consume — eight to twelve hours."

Eight to twelve hours. The window that the alliance would have to reach the Gate, fight through the capital's defenses, and close the dimensional portal. Eight to twelve hours between Valdremor's failure and his recovery. Eight to twelve hours during which the Gate would be at its most vulnerable and the blade would be at its most effective.

"We need to be at the Gate when the window opens," Itzil said.

"The outer defenses are the obstacle," Kaelen said. The scout's tactical assessment was immediate — the intelligence officer's evaluation of the challenge that the operational timeline presented. "The capital's garrison is weakened but not eliminated. Nightshade's blood-ward soldiers are still operational — they're not oath-bound, they're loyalty-bound. The Ashvanar brother is still in his sorcery tower. Valdremor's personal defenses are still intact."

"Then we go through them," Itzil said. The statement was not bravado — it was assessment. The particular, calm evaluation of a commander who understood that the obstacle between the army and the Gate was military rather than magical, and that military obstacles were what armies were designed to overcome.

She drew the reforged blade. The weapon blazed — the nine-colored light filling the command position with the particular, warm luminosity that the soul-threads produced. Every hero within range felt their thread respond — the dimensional connection between each contributor and the weapon producing the resonance that enhanced their capability.

The army saw the blade. The nine-colored light — visible across the formations, the beacon that the soldiers had been orienting toward since the march began — blazed with the amplified intensity that the Gate's weakening had produced. The light was a signal. The light was a promise. The light was the visual expression of a weapon that carried nine souls and that was ready for the fight that the war had been building toward.

"Push," Itzil said. The word was an order. The word was a commitment. The word was the single syllable that converted the defensive posture that the campaign had maintained into the offensive operation that the window's approach demanded.

The army pushed. The advance that had been methodical became aggressive — the formations moving forward with the particular, committed velocity that existed when an army detected weakness and deployed the capability to exploit it.

The final push toward the Dominion capital had begun. The Gate was weakening. The Crown was stuttering. The window was approaching.

And the blade — nine souls, one weapon, the instrument of collective will — blazed at the army's head like a dawn that had arrived early.
