Chapter 19 - SKYREN'S RECONNAISSANCE

Skyren flew over the Dominion capital and the flight was the most dangerous thing she had ever done with Cielovar.

The hawk rider launched from the army's rear position — the altitude that the anti-air defenses' range required, the starting height that placed Cielovar above the initial threat envelope. The golden hawk climbed with the powerful, sustained wingbeats that the bird's engineered physiology produced — the flight muscles that generations of selective breeding had developed for exactly this kind of sustained, high-altitude performance.

The capital's anti-air defenses were concentrated. Every hawk-killer battery that the Dominion maintained was deployed here — the ranged weapons that targeted aerial threats, the combination of conventional and magical projectiles that produced a kill zone extending from the city's walls to approximately three thousand feet of altitude. The batteries were spaced at hundred-yard intervals along the walls — the density that eliminated the gaps between individual weapons' coverage and produced the continuous kill zone that comprehensive air defense required.

Wind-sorcery augmented the batteries. The magical practitioners who controlled atmospheric conditions had been deployed on the capital's towers — the elevated positions that provided the altitude advantage that wind manipulation required. The sorcerers created lethal turbulence — the atmospheric distortion that converted the stable air that flight depended on into the chaotic, unpredictable currents that broke wings and killed riders.

Cielovar dodged everything. The golden hawk — the partner that Skyren had flown with since the war's beginning, the bird whose capabilities matched the rider's skill — navigated the kill zone with the particular, impossible grace that existed when a hawk and rider had become one being. They moved as a single consciousness — Skyren's tactical awareness integrated with Cielovar's flight instinct, the human's intelligence directing the bird's physical capability with the seamless coordination that years of partnership had produced.

The batteries fired. The projectiles — bolts, stones, magical constructs — filled the air with the particular, lethal density that concentrated anti-air fire produced. Cielovar banked. Rolled. Dove. Climbed. The hawk's flight path was a three-dimensional evasion pattern that no ground-based targeting system could predict because the pattern was not calculated — it was instinctive. The bird's survival instinct, augmented by the rider's tactical awareness, produced the flight path that no mathematical model could generate because the path was alive.

Skyren mapped the capital. The reconnaissance that the final assault required — the detailed intelligence product that would determine the assault routes, the breach points, the defensive positions that the army would encounter. Her trained perception — the aerial observer's ability to convert visual information into tactical data — cataloged every detail that the overflight revealed.

The Gate was at the dead center. The dimensional portal occupied the plaza before the Dominion palace — the large, open space that the capital's architecture provided at its ceremonial core. The Gate was not a structure — it was an absence. A tear in reality that the plaza's stone contained, the dimensional portal visible as a distortion in the air that warped everything behind it.

The fissure above was enormous. The crack in the barrier — fifty yards wide, pulsing red — dominated the sky above the plaza. The red light that bled through the fissure was brighter here — at the source, at the point where the dimensional stress fracture was widest, the illumination from Vastrix's domain was intense enough to cast shadows on the ground below. Through the fissure, shadows moved — vast, shifting, the silhouettes of something that existed on the other side and that was pressing against the crack with the patient, immense force that three thousand years of hunger had accumulated.

She spotted the key defensive positions. The intelligence that the assault planning required — the specific locations where the Dominion had concentrated its defensive capability.

Nightshade's blood-ward perimeter. The spymaster's magical defense — the crimson barriers that surrounded the inner city's approaches, the blood-magic constructs that prevented unauthorized entry and that produced the lethal response that unauthorized attempt triggered. The perimeter was layered — three concentric rings of blood-wards, each one more powerful than the last, the defensive depth that Nightshade's professional paranoia demanded.

The remaining Ashvanar brother's sorcery tower. Gravos — the surviving sibling, the sorcerer whose brother's death had produced the berserk rage that the war's previous engagements had demonstrated — occupied a tower on the capital's eastern wall. The tower's position provided elevated line-of-sight across the approach route — the tactical advantage that the sorcerer's ranged magical capability could exploit.

Valdremor's Spire of Glass. The Architect's personal command post — the crystalline tower that rose from the palace complex, the structure from which the Gate's operation was monitored and controlled. The Spire was the Dominion's nerve center — the position from which Valdremor directed the defense and from which the Gate's activation sequence would be initiated.

She also spotted something unexpected. Serenthar's chamber — deep beneath the palace, the subterranean space that the oracle occupied. The chamber was not visible from the air — the palace's architecture concealed the underground spaces that its foundations contained. But Skyren's enhanced perception — the aerial observer's trained sensitivity, augmented by the soul-thread connection that the reforged blade provided — detected the dimensional signature that Serenthar's demon-bond produced. The oracle was there. Below the palace. In the chamber where she had been imprisoned since the Dominion had bound her.

The oracle hadn't moved. The recognition was significant — Serenthar's presence in the subterranean chamber meant that the oracle was accessible. The intelligence that Amalura believed Serenthar possessed — the knowledge of how to close the Gate, the vision that the oracle's sight might provide — was potentially available. If the assault could reach the palace. If someone could penetrate the subterranean chambers. If the oracle was willing to share what she knew.

Three conditions. Each one nearly impossible. Together, the particular, cascading impossibility that the war's endgame had become characterized by.

Skyren returned. The hawk rider descended from the kill zone — the altitude that the anti-air batteries' range prescribed, the height that the evasion flight had required. She was arrow-grazed — a projectile had caught her upper arm during the final evasion, the bolt's edge drawing a line of blood across the flesh that the hawk's banking maneuver hadn't quite avoided. The wound was superficial. The intelligence was invaluable.

She spread her map on the war table. The hand-drawn diagram that her aerial observation had produced — the tactical representation of the capital's layout, the defensive positions, the assault routes that the intelligence supported. The map was detailed — the aerial observer's trained perception converting the visual information of the overflight into the spatial data that the assault planning required.

"Here's how we get in," she said. The briefing was delivered with the particular, breathless energy that Skyren produced when the information she carried was important and the delivery was urgent. "The northwestern wall section — same weakness as the outer ring. The stone is thinner there. Older construction. Torvane's breach charges can open it."

She traced the route. From the breach to the inner city. From the inner city to the palace district. From the palace district to the Gate plaza.

"The blood-ward perimeter is the primary obstacle after the walls. Three rings. The outer ring is manageable — conventional ward-disruption can handle it. The middle ring is stronger — needs Torvane's specialized disruptors. The inner ring is Nightshade's personal work. That one..." She paused. "That one I don't know how to break."

"Rainara," Itzil said. "Water dilutes blood-magic. She proved it at the detention tower."

"Then Rainara handles the inner ring. But she'll need to be at the perimeter when we reach it."

The planning continued. The assault route mapped. The obstacles identified. The capabilities assigned. The particular, systematic work that converted intelligence into plan and plan into action.

"It won't be easy," Skyren said. "It might not be possible. But here's how."

The words were the particular, honest assessment that Skyren provided — the aerial observer's evaluation that acknowledged the difficulty without retreating from the recommendation. The route was there. The obstacles were there. The capability to address the obstacles was there. The question was whether the capability could be deployed fast enough, precisely enough, and with sufficient force to overcome the obstacles before the window closed.

The plan was set. The intelligence was delivered. The assault route was mapped.

Tomorrow, the siege would begin in earnest. The outer ring first. Then the walls. Then the blood-ward perimeter. Then the Gate.

The hawk rider touched the wound on her arm — the arrow-graze that the flight had produced, the physical evidence of the risk that the reconnaissance had required. The wound was small. The intelligence was enormous.

Skyren had done what she did best: fly into the impossible and bring back the map that showed the way through.
