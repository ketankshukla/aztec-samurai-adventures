Chapter 21 - TORVANE'S PREPARATIONS

Torvane deployed his engineering for the siege and every device was an extension of the care that had built it.

The engineer worked through the night — the hours between the camp's settling and the dawn's arrival consumed by the final preparations that the assault demanded. The devices were ready — they had been ready for days, the engineer's compulsive verification ensuring that every mechanism functioned and every charge was stable. But ready was not enough. Ready was the minimum. Torvane needed perfect.

The siege engines were his primary contribution. The mobile platforms that the army's advance had transported — the wheeled structures that carried the heavy weapons and protective shields that siege operations required. The engines were Torvane's design — the particular, optimized machines that his engineering mind had produced by analyzing the Dominion's defensive architecture and creating the specific countermeasures that each defensive element demanded.

Ward-disruptors were positioned at the assault's vanguard. The devices that neutralized magical defenses — the technology that Torvane had developed through the war's progression, the countermeasure that converted the Dominion's ward-barriers from impassable obstacles into temporary inconveniences. The disruptors had been refined since their first deployment — each iteration more powerful, more efficient, the particular improvement that iterative engineering produced.

Explosive charges were prepared for the wall breach. The demolition packages that Torvane had designed for the northwestern weakness that Skyren's reconnaissance had identified — the precise quantity of explosive material, arranged in the specific configuration that the wall's structural properties demanded. The charges were calculated — the blast pattern engineered to produce the breach that the assault required without the collateral damage that indiscriminate demolition created.

Communication arrays were deployed across the assault's sectors. The signal devices that Torvane had built — the mechanical and magical instruments that would allow the assault's commanders to coordinate their operations across the battlefield's expanse. The arrays were the army's nervous system — the infrastructure that converted a collection of independent units into a coordinated force that could respond to changing conditions faster than the enemy could exploit them.

But the special device — the creation that exceeded everything else — was the mobile ward-shield. The engineering achievement that Torvane had been developing since the march began, the protective platform that could shield a column of soldiers from sorcery while they advanced.

The ward-shield was a mobile barrier. A wheeled platform that generated a dimensional field — the protective energy that deflected magical attacks the way a physical shield deflected arrows. The field extended above and around the column that the platform accompanied — the protective dome that converted the exposed approach to the enemy's positions into the covered advance that assault troops needed to survive.

The power source was unexpected. The Starshard relic's residual energy — the dimensional artifact that the alliance had recovered in an earlier operation, the crystal whose primary function had been consumed but whose residual output still exceeded what conventional power sources could provide. Torvane had integrated the Starshard's energy into the ward-shield's generator — the particular, creative engineering that converted an exhausted relic's residual output into the continuous power that the shield's operation demanded.

He checked every device personally. The engineer's hands — calloused, scarred, precise — verified every mechanism that the assault would depend on. Every bolt was tight. Every charge was stable. Every connection was secure. The verification was not efficient — the time that personal inspection consumed exceeded what delegation would have required. But the verification was necessary. Torvane's standard was not "probably works." Torvane's standard was "I checked it myself."

He thought about what Solkren taught him. The armorer's philosophy — the understanding that tools were an extension of the maker, that the quality of the creation reflected the care of the creator. Torvane's machines were an extension of his care. Every soldier who would be protected by his ward-shield was alive because he cared enough to check one more bolt. Every assault troop who would advance through the breach was alive because he calculated one more charge configuration. Every commander who would coordinate through his communication arrays was effective because he tested one more signal device.

The care was the weapon. Not the machines — the care that built the machines. The particular, essential quality that existed when a person's professional capability was driven by the personal investment that caring produced.

Torvane looked at the Dominion capital. The dark walls that rose from the river plain — the architectural statement that the empire had made when it built the city that contained its seat of power. The walls were impressive. The walls were engineered. The walls were the product of competent architects and skilled builders.

But the walls had a weakness. The northwestern section — the thinner stone, the older construction, the structural vulnerability that time and geology had produced. Torvane had already calculated the breach parameters. The charges were set. The approach was planned.

"Everything has a weakness," he said. The words were addressed to the capital's walls — the engineer's assessment delivered to the obstacle that his devices would overcome. "Even empires."

The dawn approached. The devices were ready. The charges were set. The shields were powered. The arrays were deployed.

The engineer's contribution was complete. The machines that his care had built waited for the moment that the assault would deploy them.

Torvane looked at his hands. The calloused, scarred, precise hands that had built every device the army would depend on. The hands that had given their need for control to the reforged blade and that now worked with the faith that replaced the control — the willingness to build without guarantees, to create knowing it might not work, to care enough to check one more bolt even when the checking couldn't ensure the outcome.

The hands were ready. The devices were ready. The assault was ready.

Tomorrow's dawn would test everything he had built. And Torvane — the engineer who had given his control to the blade and who now built with faith instead — was as ready as his hands could make him.
