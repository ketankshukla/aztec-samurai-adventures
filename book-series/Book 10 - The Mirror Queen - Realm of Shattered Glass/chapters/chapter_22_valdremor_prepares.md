Chapter 22 - VALDREMOR PREPARES

Valdremor stood in his Spire of Glass and prepared for the siege with calculations that were wrong in ways he couldn't see.

The Architect's command post occupied the crystalline tower's upper level — the space that provided the visual and dimensional overview that the Gate's operation and the capital's defense required. The Spire was the Dominion's nerve center — the position from which every defensive decision was made, every military order was issued, every calculation that the Gate's activation demanded was performed.

The crystal eye blazed. The prosthetic that provided Valdremor's dimensional sight was operating at maximum output — the device processing the incoming data from the Gate's monitoring system, the defensive positions' reports, and the intelligence that Nightshade's remaining network provided. The eye's blue-white glow illuminated the Architect's face with the particular, cold light that dimensional energy produced.

He had prepared for the siege. The defense was layered — the military engineering that Valdremor's analytical mind had designed, the redundant, multi-phase defensive architecture that converted the capital into a fortress that could withstand sustained assault. Every defensive element was positioned. Every contingency was planned. Every variable was calculated.

But his calculations were wrong. The data that Amalura had deliberately corrupted was embedded in every equation that the Architect's analysis depended on. The errors were invisible — the corrupted numbers indistinguishable from accurate ones, the particular, devastating sabotage that a scholar who understood knowledge could produce when she turned knowledge itself into a weapon.

He expected the Sun-Blade to still be vulnerable to blood-corrosion. The analysis that he had performed — based on the dimensional frequency data that Amalura had corrupted — told him that the corrosion spell would work against the reforged blade. The analysis was wrong. The reforged blade operated at a frequency that the corrosion technique couldn't target. Nightshade's most effective weapon against the bearer was useless.

He expected the Gate to have more energy reserve than it did. The calculations that projected the Gate's power state — based on the threshold data that Amalura had set fifteen percent too low — told him that the energy reservoir was sufficient for activation. The calculations were wrong. The actual threshold was higher than Valdremor believed. The activation attempt that he was planning would fail.

He expected the outer defenses to hold longer. The tactical models that projected the fortification ring's resistance — based on the force estimates that his intelligence had produced — told him that the outer ring would withstand approximately seventy-two hours of assault. The models were optimistic — the weakened garrison, the demoralized troops, the infrastructure's degradation exceeding what the models had accounted for.

But he was still Valdremor. Even with flawed data, the Architect's brilliance produced contingencies that compensated for uncertainty. The defense was layered in depth — if one element failed, the next activated. Redundancy upon redundancy. The particular, systematic approach that brilliant engineers applied to systems that couldn't afford to fail.

The redundancies were genuine. The first layer's failure activated the second. The second's failure activated the third. The cascade of fallback positions and contingency plans and alternative defensive configurations that Valdremor's mind had produced was real — the product of an intelligence that designed for failure as carefully as it designed for success.

He visited Serenthar one final time. The oracle occupied the subterranean chamber beneath the palace — the space that the Dominion had constructed to contain the demon-bound seer whose visions had served the empire since her binding. The chamber was deep — accessed through corridors that descended into the palace's foundations, the passages that connected the surface world to the underground spaces where the Dominion kept its most controlled assets.

Serenthar sat in her chair. The oracle — the Weeping One, the seer whose tears flowed constantly, the woman whose demon-bond forced visions of every possible future simultaneously — was in the state that she always occupied. Weeping. The tears were not grief — they were overflow. The particular, physical response that a consciousness produced when it was processing more information than the body could contain.

She looked at Valdremor. The oracle's eyes — milky, unseeing in the conventional sense, perceiving everything in the dimensional sense — fixed on the Architect with the particular, devastating awareness that saw not a person but a convergence of futures.

"How does this end?" Valdremor asked. The question was direct — the Architect's communication style applied to the oracle who had served his empire and who might, in these final hours, provide the information that his calculations couldn't.

"You already know," Serenthar said. The oracle's voice was steady — the particular, calm delivery that existed when a person who saw all futures spoke about the future that was approaching. The words were not evasive. They were accurate — Valdremor's analytical mind had already produced the assessment that the oracle was confirming.

"I want to hear you say it."

Serenthar paused. The brief cessation of tears that indicated a moment of focused vision — the oracle concentrating on a specific future rather than processing the infinite field of possibilities that her sight normally encompassed.

"In one future, you win," she said. "In another, you lose. In both, you wish you'd done things differently."

The words settled into the subterranean chamber with the particular, devastating weight that accurate prophecy carried. The prophecy was not specific — it didn't describe the battle's outcome or the Gate's fate or the alliance's success or failure. The prophecy was emotional — the prediction that regardless of the outcome, the person who had built the Gate and ordered the ash-oaths and consumed thousands of lives would wish that the path had been different.

Regret. In both futures. The particular, human emotion that Valdremor's analytical mind had been designed to override — the feeling that existed when a person evaluated their choices and found them wanting. The oracle was telling him that the regret was inescapable. That the path he had chosen — the Gate, the oaths, the hunger that he was releasing — would produce the wish that he hadn't chosen it, regardless of whether the choice produced victory or defeat.

Valdremor returned to his command post. The crystal eye blazed. The calculations ran. The defense was prepared. The Gate was approaching activation.

He was not afraid. He had never been afraid — the emotional response that fear represented had been trained out of him decades ago, replaced by the risk assessment that professional analysis provided. Fear was an inefficient response to danger. Analysis was superior.

But for the first time, he wondered if he should be. The particular, quiet question that the oracle's words had planted — the seed of doubt in a mind that had been constructed to exclude doubt. The question was not analytical. It was personal. The particular, human inquiry that existed when a person who had spent their life being certain was confronted with the suggestion that certainty might be wrong.

He pushed the question aside. The defense required attention. The Gate required monitoring. The siege was approaching.

The question persisted. Beneath the analysis. Beneath the calculations. Beneath the crystal eye's cold light.

Should I be afraid?

The question had no answer that his framework could provide. And the absence of an answer was, itself, the most frightening thing the Architect had ever experienced.
