Chapter 23 - THE SIEGE BEGINS

Dawn broke red and the allied army attacked the Dominion capital with everything it had left.

The first wave launched at the moment the light crossed the horizon — the particular, calculated timing that assault doctrine prescribed, the dawn attack that maximized the visual advantage that the rising sun provided to forces attacking from the east. The sun was behind the alliance. The sun was in the Dominion's eyes. The small advantage that geography and timing provided — the modest improvement in targeting accuracy and the modest reduction in defensive visibility — was the kind of edge that competent commanders exploited because in siege operations, every edge mattered.

Thalendor heavy infantry advanced behind Torvane's mobile ward-shields. The armored soldiers — the professional warriors that the kingdom of Thalendor had contributed to the alliance, the troops whose training and equipment were designed for exactly this kind of sustained, protected advance — moved in formation behind the wheeled platforms that generated the dimensional barriers. The ward-shields deflected the sorcery that the Dominion's defensive positions launched — the magical projectiles and area-effect spells that should have devastated the advancing column instead dissipating against the protective field that Torvane's engineering had created.

Pyrrath cavalry flanked. The mounted soldiers — the fast-moving forces that the kingdom of Pyrrath had provided — swept around the fortification ring's sides, engaging the defensive positions from angles that the front-facing fortifications weren't designed to address. The flanking attacks were not decisive — the cavalry couldn't breach the fortifications. But the attacks divided the garrison's attention — the defensive forces that should have been concentrating on the frontal assault were now responding to the threats on their flanks.

Alliance shock troops hit the northwestern wall weakness. The assault's main effort — the concentrated force that the assault plan directed at the structural vulnerability that Skyren's reconnaissance had identified. The shock troops were the army's best — the soldiers whose combat capability had been proven through months of war, the warriors who were deployed at the point of maximum effort because the point of maximum effort required the maximum capability.

The Dominion responded with everything. The garrison's defensive capability — concentrated at the capital, reinforced by the troops that the outer empire's collapse had made available — deployed against the assault with the full-spectrum response that comprehensive defense demanded.

Arrows darkened the sky. The conventional projectiles that massed archery produced — the thousands of shafts that the garrison's bow-equipped soldiers launched in the coordinated volleys that defensive doctrine prescribed. The arrows fell on the advancing formations with the particular, lethal density that massed fire produced — the rain of steel-tipped wood that converted open ground into a killing field.

Sorcery struck the ward-shields. The magical practitioners that the Dominion had concentrated at the capital launched their attacks against the advancing columns — the dimensional energy and elemental magic that constituted the garrison's magical defensive capability. Fire, lightning, earth manipulation, the blood-magic constructs that Nightshade's practitioners produced — all of it directed at the ward-shields that protected the advancing infantry.

The ward-shields held. Torvane's engineering — the devices that his care had built and his verification had confirmed — absorbed the magical assault with the particular, reliable performance that quality construction produced. The shields flickered under the heaviest strikes — the dimensional field straining when multiple magical attacks converged on the same point. But the shields held. The field maintained. The advancing columns continued.

Itzil fought at the front with the reforged blade. The commander's position was not behind the lines — it was at the assault's vanguard, the blade blazing with the nine-colored light that cut through the red glow of the fissure above. Every swing of the blade sent shockwaves of golden light — the dimensional energy that the weapon's architecture produced, the force that exceeded what conventional weapons could generate.

The blade's soul-threads resonated. Every hero fighting nearby felt the boost — the modest but measurable enhancement that the distributed power provided through the dimensional connection that the soul-forge had established. Jagren's sword glowed faintly red. Kaelen's blades shimmered with blue light. Neyla's turquoise light intensified. The resonance was the force multiplier that Solkren had discovered — the distributed capability that made the team more than the sum of its parts.

Rainara created water-walls. The water-mystic's defensive capability — deployed at the assault's flanks, the positions where the advancing columns were most vulnerable to the sorcery that the garrison's magical practitioners launched from elevated positions. The water-walls deflected the incoming spells — the liquid barriers absorbing or redirecting the magical energy that should have struck the exposed soldiers.

Skyren coordinated from the air. The hawk rider's aerial perspective — the overview that altitude provided — was transmitted to the assault's commanders through Torvane's communication arrays. The real-time intelligence that Skyren provided allowed the assault to respond to the garrison's defensive adjustments faster than the garrison could implement them.

Zariel managed the flanking forces. The diplomat — whose intelligence training included tactical coordination — directed the Pyrrath cavalry and the auxiliary forces that the flanking attacks required. The coordination was precise — each flanking action timed to coincide with the frontal assault's progression, the particular synchronization that maximized the flanking attacks' diversionary effect.

Jagren led the breach team. The duelist — positioned at the assault's point of maximum effort — fought through the northwestern fortifications with the particular, devastating efficiency that his combat capability produced. The breach team — the shock troops that the assault plan directed at the wall's weakness — advanced behind Jagren's blade, the duelist clearing the path that the demolition charges required.

Torvane detonated the wall charges. The explosive packages that the engineer had calculated and positioned and verified — the demolition that the breach required — were triggered at the moment that the breach team reached the wall's base. The detonation was precise — the blast pattern engineered to produce the structural failure that the assault needed without the excess damage that imprecise demolition created.

The outer wall cracked. The stone that had resisted centuries of weathering and decades of maintenance — the architectural achievement that the Dominion had constructed as the capital's perimeter defense — fractured under the force that Torvane's charges applied to the weakness that Skyren's reconnaissance had identified.

Then the wall broke. The crack widened — the structural failure propagating from the blast point through the weakness's extent, the stone separating along the fault lines that time and geology had created and that the explosive charges had activated. The breach opened — a gap in the fortification ring, the hole in the defense that the assault had been designed to create.

The allied army poured through the breach. The shock troops first — the warriors who had fought their way to the wall's base, who had endured the arrow-fire and the sorcery and the casualties that the approach had produced. Then the infantry — the armored soldiers who would hold the breach against the garrison's counter-attack. Then the support elements — the engineers and medics and the logistics that would sustain the penetration.

The outer ring fell. The fortification that the Dominion had constructed as the capital's first defense — the trenches and earthworks and ward-barriers that had been designed to resist sustained assault — was breached. The alliance was through. The approach to the capital's walls was open.

But ahead: the inner walls. The capital proper. The black stone walls that rose forty feet from the river plain. The second layer of defense that Valdremor's redundant architecture provided. The obstacle that the second wave would have to overcome.

And beyond the inner walls: the palace district. The Spire of Glass. The Great Gate plaza. The fissure. The shadow.

The hardest part hadn't even started.

The outer ring was down. The breach was open. The army was through.

And the blade — blazing at the army's head, nine colors cutting through the red — pointed forward. Always forward.

The siege continued. The second wave was forming. The inner walls waited.

And through the fissure above, the shadow pressed — vast, hungry, patient — watching the battle that would determine whether the world survived or was consumed.
