# About the Author

**Ketan Shukla** is the author of the *Aztec Samurai Adventures* series and multiple non-fiction titles. He writes stories about people who show up — every time, regardless of what "there" contains — and who discover that showing up is the prerequisite for everything that matters.

He lives with his wife Nimisha and believes that the most important thing a person can do is be present when the people they love need them.

*Aztec Samurai Adventures* is his first fiction series.
