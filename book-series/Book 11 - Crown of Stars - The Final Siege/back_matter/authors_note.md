# Author's Note

Thank you for reading *Crown of Stars*.

This is the book where everything ends. Every villain. Every battle. Every threat that ten books of conflict had been building toward.

Nightshade falls — not pushed, but stepping backward off the wall. Her choice. The woman who built her life on control making the final act of control that remained. I offered her Itzil's hand. She couldn't take it. Some people can't be saved. Not because the saving is impossible — because the person chooses not to be saved.

Valdremor is captured — not by force but by Amalura's superior judgment. "You stole my knowledge. But knowledge is only half of wisdom." The Architect, undone by the Keeper. The most satisfying villain defeat I've ever written.

Serenthar walks through the Gate. The oracle who opened it three thousand years ago closes it. "In every single one... I chose this." She smiled. The first time she had ever smiled. The tears stopped. The centuries of guilt released.

And the Crown breaks. The Starless Crown — the void that had been eating the sky since Book 4 — shatters into a million points of golden light that fall like golden snow. Dawn breaks. Real dawn. Warm, golden, pure.

"You showed up." "I always do."

One book remains. *The Sun That Never Sets*. The aftermath. The healing. The future that the heroes bought with everything they had.

We're almost home.

With gratitude,
Ketan Shukla
