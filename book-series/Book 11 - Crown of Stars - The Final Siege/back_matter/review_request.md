# A Quick Favor

If the golden snow made you cry — if "You showed up" / "I always do" hit you where it was supposed to — would you consider leaving a review on Amazon?

Reviews help other readers find the series. And they help me keep writing stories about people who show up. Every time.

Even a single sentence:

> *"The Crown broke and I broke with it."*

Thank you for reading. One book remains. We're almost home.
