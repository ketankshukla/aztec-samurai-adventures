# Chapter 1 Summary — THE INNER WALL

**POV:** Itzil

Inner wall defended by Nightshade's blood-ward army — 4,000 soldiers fighting without fear or pain. Blade severs blood-wards one at a time, but too many. Neyla reverses wards on captured soldiers behind lines. Freed soldiers turn on former controllers.

The wall holds. Itzil needs to break Nightshade's control at the source — get to Nightshade herself.

**Key Events:** Blood-ward army engaged, blade severs individual wards, Neyla reverses captured soldiers, assault stalls.

**Cliffhanger:** The mathematics are unfavorable. Cut the head and the body falls.
