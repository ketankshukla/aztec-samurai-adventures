# Chapter 2 Summary — NIGHTSHADE'S ARMY

**POV:** Nightshade (Villain)

Nightshade commands from a tower, sustaining 4,000 blood-ward connections. Exhausting, draining. Watches Neyla freeing soldiers: "That healer. She undoes everything I build."

Decides to confront Itzil personally — not because she has to, because she WANTS to. This has been coming for ten books. Steps onto the wall: "Sun-Blade bearer! Enough hiding behind your army. Face me."

**Key Events:** Blood-ward network strain, Neyla's threat recognized, personal challenge issued.

**Cliffhanger:** The challenge hangs in the air. Both armies watch.
