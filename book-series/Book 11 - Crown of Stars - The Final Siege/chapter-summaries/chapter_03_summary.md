# Chapter 3 Summary — ITZIL VS. NIGHTSHADE

**POV:** Itzil

Itzil climbs the wall alone. Round three. Nightshade fights with everything: blood-whips, shields, portals. More powerful than ever. But the reforged blade resonates — each strike disrupts blood-magic fundamentally.

Itzil finds the keystone: the invisible thread linking Nightshade to the entire network. One precise cut — golden light slicing through red magic.

**Key Events:** Duel on the wall, blade's resonance revealed, blood-ward keystone identified and severed.

**Cliffhanger:** The thread is cut. The wall changes.
