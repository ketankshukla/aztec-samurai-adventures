# Chapter 4 Summary — THE WARDS FALL

**POV:** Itzil

4,000 blood-ward soldiers freeze, blink, collapse. Fear, pain, fatigue return simultaneously. Nightshade staggers — power source severed. Stripped of everything.

Itzil: "Surrender." Nightshade: "I was never the kind of person who takes someone else's hand." Steps backward off the wall. Her choice. Sixth villain defeat.

**Key Events:** Blood-ward network collapses, 4,000 soldiers freed, Nightshade offered mercy, Nightshade falls by choice.

**Cliffhanger:** Some people can't be saved. Not because saving is impossible — because they choose not to be saved.
