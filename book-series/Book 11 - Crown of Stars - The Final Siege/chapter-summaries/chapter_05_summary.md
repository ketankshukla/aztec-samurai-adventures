# Chapter 5 Summary — THE INNER WALL FALLS

**POV:** Kaelen

Blood-wards broken, inner wall defense collapses. Freed soldiers lay down weapons. Army pours through. Kaelen coordinates urban advance — snipers, traps, pockets of resistance. Moves like a ghost. Shadow-fade lasts 12 seconds now.

Reaches vantage point overlooking palace district. Gate visible: massive arch, fissure blazing red, shadows moving inside. Vastrix trying to squeeze through.

**Key Events:** Inner wall falls, palace district open, urban warfare, Gate visible, Vastrix pressing through.

**Cliffhanger:** Time is running out. The Gate is failing. Vastrix is approaching.
