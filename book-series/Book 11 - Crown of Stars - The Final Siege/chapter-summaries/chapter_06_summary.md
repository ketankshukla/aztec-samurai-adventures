# Chapter 6 Summary — THE ASHVANAR'S END

**POV:** Torvane

Gravos — completely mad — fortifies a sorcery tower. Doesn't want to win, wants to burn everything. Going to overload — suicide attack that could level a city block.

Torvane dismantles defenses layer by layer: ward-disruptors, signal-jammers, energy-redirect panels. Gravos overcharges. Torvane activates his resonance inverter — turns the energy inward. Tower implodes. Seventh villain defeat. With math.

**Key Events:** Sorcery tower assault, layer-by-layer dismantling, overload prevented, resonance inverter deployed, Ashvanar crushed.

**Cliffhanger:** The quiet engineer saved the army. The path to the palace is clear.
