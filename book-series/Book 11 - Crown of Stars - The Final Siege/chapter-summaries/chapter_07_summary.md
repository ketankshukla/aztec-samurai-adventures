# Chapter 7 Summary — VALDREMOR'S GAMBIT

**POV:** Valdremor (Villain)

Everything has fallen. Valdremor recalculates — numbers don't work. Realizes: Amalura sabotaged his data. He's been making decisions based on lies for months. The revelation refines him.

Prepares a philosophical gambit — not military. Descends from his Spire. Walks through the chaos untouched. Sits on the throne. Waits.

**Key Events:** Sabotage discovered, data corruption realized, military options exhausted, philosophical gambit prepared.

**Cliffhanger:** The most dangerous man in the Dominion is offering words. Words, in the right mouth, are the most dangerous weapon of all.
