# Chapter 8 Summary — THE PALACE GATES

**POV:** Itzil

Army reaches the palace. Gold and obsidian doors sealed with wards. Itzil cuts through — nine soul-threads blaze. Doors shatter.

Inside: vast, dark throne room. One figure on the throne. Valdremor. Calm. No guards. "Welcome, Sun-Blade bearer." The full hero team enters. Through the window: the Gate, fifty yards away. "You're running out of time. Shall we talk?"

**Key Events:** Palace breached, wards cut, throne room entered, Valdremor waiting alone, Gate visible.

**Cliffhanger:** He's not offering violence. He's offering words.
