# Chapter 9 Summary — VALDREMOR'S OFFER

**POV:** Itzil

Valdremor offers: close the Gate himself in exchange for exile. His argument is terrifyingly logical — power vacuum, fifty wars, someone has to go through the Gate (one-way trip). Itzil hesitates. He's not wrong.

Amalura steps forward: "He's right that there will be chaos. He's wrong that it's worse than slavery."

**Key Events:** Exile offer, power vacuum argument, Gate closure requires sacrifice, Amalura's moral counter.

**Cliffhanger:** Chaos is terrible. Slavery is worse. The decision is Itzil's.
