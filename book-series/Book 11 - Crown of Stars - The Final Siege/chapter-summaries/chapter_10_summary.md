# Chapter 10 Summary — THE REFUSAL

**POV:** Itzil

Itzil refuses: "No exile. No escape. You answer for what you've done." Valdremor genuinely surprised — didn't model moral conviction as a factor. "I would sacrifice my OWN life before I let you walk away."

Valdremor activates disintegration ward — final contingency. Death at the speed of magic. Amalura raises her hand.

**Key Events:** Deal refused, moral conviction over logic, disintegration ward activated, Amalura ready to counter.

**Cliffhanger:** Death approaches. And Amalura raises her hand.
