# Chapter 11 Summary — AMALURA'S REVENGE

**POV:** Amalura

Amalura counters the ward with Valdremor's own safety phrase — learned during captivity. "You stole my knowledge. But knowledge is only half of wisdom." Valdremor has no response. First time in his life.

Jagren and Kaelen seize him. He doesn't resist. Looks at Amalura: "Remarkable." She: "I know." Eighth villain defeat — intellectual, not physical.

**Key Events:** Ward countered, Valdremor outsmarted, captured, intellectual defeat by the Keeper.

**Cliffhanger:** The Architect is captured. But the Gate is still open. How to close it?
