# Chapter 12 Summary — SERENTHAR'S CHAMBER

**POV:** Itzil

Descent into the depths beneath the palace. Dark corridors, cold stone, air that tastes of tears. Find Serenthar — ancient, alien, weeping. Ember-red eyes. White hair pooling around her.

She speaks before they do: "You've come to ask me how to close the Gate." Itzil: "Can it be closed without someone going through?" Serenthar weeps harder. "No."

**Key Events:** Oracle found, question asked, devastating answer — someone must go through. One-way trip.

**Cliffhanger:** Someone has to not come back. The question of who hangs in the dark air.
