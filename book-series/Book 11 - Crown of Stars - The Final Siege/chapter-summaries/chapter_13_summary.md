# Chapter 13 Summary — THE ORACLE'S TRUTH

**POV:** Serenthar

First full Serenthar POV. She has seen every future. In every one where the Gate closes, someone walks through and doesn't come back. She's watched these heroes for months — fight, love, grieve, persist.

She's seen one future where it all works. "In that future, I am the one who walks through." She smiles — first time EVER. The tears stop.

**Key Events:** Oracle's full perspective, every future seen, one future that works, Serenthar volunteers, first smile.

**Cliffhanger:** The woman who opened the Gate is going to close it. The tears are still. The choice is made.
