Stunned silence. Itzil: "Why? You served the Dominion for centuries." Serenthar: "I served the GATE. Close it and I die regardless. The question is whether I die usefully."

Final truth: she originally opened the Gate centuries ago. Bound by a demon she didn't understand. Everything traces back to her mistake. "I opened the Gate. I should be the one to close it." The team agrees.

**Key Events:** Oracle's motivation revealed, Gate origin explained, responsibility accepted, team consensus.

**Cliffhanger:** The oracle who started everything is going to end it.
