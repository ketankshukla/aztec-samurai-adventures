# Chapter 17 Summary — THE LAST NIGHT

**POV:** Itzil

Last quiet night. Itzil and Kaelen sit together on the palace terrace. They talk about after — not the battle. "A house somewhere. With a view." "A view of what?" "Doesn't matter. As long as you're in it."

"We're going to win." "How do you know?" "Because we showed up." They fall asleep leaning against each other. Blade between them. Nine soul-threads pulse — a quiet heartbeat shared by nine people who chose to be family.

**Key Events:** Intimate moment, future dreamed, Korvain's lesson invoked, blade communion.

**Cliffhanger:** Tomorrow would come. Tonight was enough.
