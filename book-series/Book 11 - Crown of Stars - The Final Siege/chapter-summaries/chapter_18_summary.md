# Chapter 18 Summary — DALRIGNON'S LAST STAND

**POV:** Torvane

Dawn. Dalrignon has fortified the plaza with micro-portals — soldiers step on them and teleport into walls, sky, ground. Killing field of spatial distortion. Advance stalls.

Torvane recalibrates his resonance inverter for portals. Inverts them — soldiers now teleport THROUGH walls instead of into them. Dalrignon panics, overcharges. Torvane redirects the overcharge into Dalrignon's anchor crystal. Implosion. Ninth villain defeat. Plaza approaches clear.

**Key Events:** Micro-portal killing field, resonance inverter recalibrated, portals inverted, Dalrignon consumed.

**Cliffhanger:** The path to the Gate is open. The final battle is at hand.
