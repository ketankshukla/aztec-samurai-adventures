# Chapter 19 Summary — THE GATE PLAZA

**POV:** Itzil

Army reaches the plaza. Gate at center — black stone arch, fissure blazing. Vastrix visible: shadow the size of the sky, eyes like dead stars, mouth that is an absence. Psychic pressure crushing — soldiers fall, some flee, many hold.

Itzil raises the blade. Counter-frequency pushes back the assault. Serenthar waits at the edge. "EVERYONE. NOW." The army charges. The final battle begins.

**Key Events:** Gate plaza reached, Vastrix visible, psychic pressure, blade's counter-frequency, army charges.

**Cliffhanger:** The final battle. Everything. Now.
