# Chapter 21 Summary — THE BLADE VS. VASTRIX

**POV:** Itzil

Itzil charges the Gate. Blade meets Vastrix's energy — golden light against crimson darkness. Shockwaves crack the plaza. The blade HURTS Vastrix — but it's like stabbing an ocean. Every hero channels their soul-thread.

Tendrils multiply — five, ten for every one severed. "I can hold it. But I can't hold it forever." Looks at Serenthar: "NOW. GO NOW."

**Key Events:** Blade vs. Vastrix, entity hurt but too vast, all heroes channeling, tendrils proliferating, signal to Serenthar.

**Cliffhanger:** The blade holds. For as long as the holding can last.
