# Chapter 22 Summary — SERENTHAR WALKS THROUGH

**POV:** Serenthar

Serenthar walks toward the Gate — reality parts for her. She opened it; it remembers. Pauses at the threshold. Looks back at the heroes. Weeps one final time — from relief.

After centuries of seeing every future, she's finally in ONE. The present. Steps through. "I see the keystone. I see every future that leads here. And in every single one... I chose this."

**Key Events:** Oracle approaches Gate, reality parts, final look back, steps through, sees keystone.

**Cliffhanger:** The voice fades. The fissure trembles. On the other side, she walks toward the crystal.
