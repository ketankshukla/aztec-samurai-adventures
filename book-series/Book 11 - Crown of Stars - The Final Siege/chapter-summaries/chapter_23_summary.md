# Chapter 23 Summary — THE KEYSTONE FALLS

**POV:** Itzil

Itzil holds Vastrix while Serenthar finds the keystone — now part of the entity. Every hero fights as one: Kaelen spots threats, Jagren cuts tendrils, Rainara drowns dark energy, Neyla heals, Skyren drops charges, Zariel commands, Torvane deploys devices, Solkren reinforces blade.

Serenthar endures Vastrix's full attention. SHATTERS the keystone. Gate convulses. Fissure SCREAMS. Crown cracks. Burst of pure white light — not destruction but release.

**Key Events:** Full team combat, keystone found and shattered, Gate begins collapsing, fissure sealing, Crown cracking.

**Cliffhanger:** The Gate begins to collapse. Serenthar does not come back.
