# Chapter 24 Summary — THE CROWN BREAKS

**POV:** Itzil

Gate collapses. Fissure seals violently. Vastrix caught half-through — trapped. SCREAMS. Itzil drives the blade into its heart. Nine colors blazing. The blade SINGS — a sound like every sunrise that ever was. Golden light erupts.

Vastrix dissolves. Crown SHATTERS into a million points of golden light — golden snow. Silence. Then dawn. Real dawn. Warm, golden, pure. Cheering — first one voice, then thousands.

She looks for Kaelen. He's there. Bleeding, exhausted, alive. "You showed up." "I always do."

**Key Events:** Gate collapses, Vastrix destroyed, Crown shatters into golden snow, dawn breaks, war is over.

**Cliffhanger:** The war is over. The heroes stand together. Now: figuring out what to do with the world they saved. One book remains.
