Chapter 5 - THE INNER WALL FALLS

With Nightshade dead and the blood-wards broken, the inner wall's defense collapsed like a structure whose keystone had been removed.

Kaelen coordinated the advance. The scout — whose tactical capability had evolved into the full-spectrum military leadership that the war's demands produced — directed the army's movement through the breach that the blood-ward network's collapse had created. The freed soldiers laid down their weapons — four thousand warriors who had been fighting without fear now experiencing every suppressed sensation simultaneously and choosing surrender over continued combat.

The allied army poured through. The inner wall — the last barrier between the army and the palace district — was open. The massive gates that the blood-ward defenders had sealed were unbarred from the inside by the freed soldiers whose restored consciousness included the particular, urgent desire to stop fighting. The gates swung open — the heavy doors that had been the inner wall's final physical defense yielding to the simple human action of hands on bars.

The palace district was open. The administrative heart of the Dominion's capital — the collection of government buildings, military headquarters, and ceremonial structures that surrounded the palace complex and the Great Gate plaza. The district was the Dominion's nerve center — the space from which the empire had been administered and from which the Gate's operation had been directed.

Kaelen moved through the streets like a shadow. Miyako's training — the shadow-school techniques that the master had taught before her death — had made him something more than a scout. He was a ghost — the particular, enhanced capability that existed when a person's natural talent was developed by expert instruction and refined by years of combat application. His shadow-fade lasted twelve seconds now — the technique that converted his body into a near-invisible presence, the duration that exceeded anything Miyako had achieved and that represented the student surpassing the master.

Urban warfare in the palace district was different from the outskirts. The buildings were larger. The streets were wider. The defensive positions were more sophisticated — the Dominion's military architecture designed to resist exactly the kind of penetration that the alliance was executing. Snipers occupied elevated positions — the long-range shooters whose accuracy converted every open space into a kill zone. Traps — magical and mechanical — were deployed at intersections and chokepoints. Pockets of resistance from loyalist Dominion soldiers who had not been blood-ward enhanced and whose genuine loyalty to the empire sustained their combat motivation.

Kaelen cleared each obstacle with the particular, methodical efficiency that his training provided. The snipers were identified by their shadow-signatures — the light distortions that their positions produced and that Kaelen's enhanced perception detected. The traps were identified by the dimensional signatures that their magical components emitted — the particular, subtle energy that Kaelen's shadow-sense registered before the trap's trigger was reached. The resistance pockets were flanked, isolated, and neutralized — the small-unit tactics that Kaelen's intelligence training and Miyako's shadow-school instruction combined to produce.

He cleared a path toward the palace. The route that the assault plan prescribed — the approach through the palace district's streets that connected the inner wall's breach to the palace complex's outer perimeter. The path was not direct — the urban environment's complexity required navigation rather than straight advance, the particular, winding route that obstacle avoidance produced.

Ahead: Valdremor's Spire of Glass. The crystalline tower that rose from the palace complex — the Architect's command post, the Dominion's nerve center, the position from which the Gate's operation was monitored and controlled. The Spire gleamed in the fissure's red light — the crystal structure catching the dimensional illumination and refracting it across the palace district in patterns that made the tower seem alive with the energy that the Gate produced.

Beyond the Spire: the Great Gate plaza. The open space that contained the dimensional portal — the arch of black stone that the fissure blazed above, the structure that Valdremor had built and that Vastrix was pressing through.

Kaelen reached a vantage point overlooking the palace district. The elevated position — the rooftop of a government building that the advance had secured — provided the visual contact that tactical assessment required. The palace complex spread below him — the buildings and courtyards and ceremonial spaces that the Dominion's architects had constructed to house the empire's administrative functions.

The Gate was visible. The massive arch of black stone occupied the central plaza — the ceremonial space that the capital's design placed at the city's geographic and symbolic center. The arch was ancient — the original structure that the Gate's initial construction had produced, the dimensional portal that had been opened centuries ago and that Valdremor's engineering had expanded and enhanced.

Through the arch, the fissure blazed red. The crack in the barrier — the dimensional stress fracture that the Gate's operation had produced — was enormous at this proximity. The red light that bled through was not light in any normal sense — it was the dimensional illumination of Vastrix's domain, the particular, wrong quality of energy that existed in a place where the physical laws were different from the human world's.

Shadows moved inside. The silhouettes that were visible through the fissure's red light — the shapes that pressed against the barrier's weakening structure with the patient, immense force of something that had been waiting for three thousand years. Vastrix. Not fully manifested — the barrier still held, the fissure still contained the entity's approach. But pressing. Approaching. The shadow growing as the barrier weakened.

Vastrix was trying to squeeze through. The entity — the dimension of hunger that Neyla's soul-sight had revealed — was pressing against the crack in reality with the force that exceeded what the barrier's remaining strength could resist indefinitely. The fissure was widening. The red light was intensifying. The shadows were growing.

Time was running out. The recognition hit Kaelen with the tactical clarity that his training provided — the intelligence officer's assessment of a situation that was deteriorating faster than the operation's timeline could accommodate. The Gate was failing. Vastrix was approaching. The window that Amalura had predicted was not a future event — it was happening now.

The army needed to reach the Gate. Now. Before the fissure widened further. Before the barrier failed completely. Before the hunger that was bigger than the world pushed through the crack in reality and replaced everything.

Kaelen activated the communication array. Torvane's devices — the signal infrastructure that connected the assault's commanders — transmitted the assessment to Itzil and the team.

"The Gate is failing. Vastrix is pressing through. We need to reach the plaza now."

The response was immediate. The army's advance accelerated — the methodical progression through the palace district's streets converting into the rapid advance that the deteriorating timeline demanded.

The palace was ahead. The Gate was ahead. The hunger was ahead.

And the army that had fought through every obstacle the Dominion had placed between them and this moment was running out of time to face the last one.
