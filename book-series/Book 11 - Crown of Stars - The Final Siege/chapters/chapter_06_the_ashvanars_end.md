Chapter 6 - THE ASHVANAR'S END

The surviving Ashvanar brother made his last stand in a sorcery tower and the stand was not a defense but a detonation waiting to happen.

Gravos — the last of the Ashvanar siblings, the sorcerer whose brother's death in Book 4 had shattered the sanity that his combat capability depended on — had fortified a tower in the palace district's eastern sector. The tower was not a military position — it was a one-man fortress of dark energy, the concentrated output of a grief-maddened sorcerer who had decided that if the world was taking everything from him, he would take everything from the world.

The tower glowed. The sorcery that Gravos had poured into the structure — the accumulated dark energy of a practitioner operating without restraint — illuminated the building from within. The glow was not light — it was radiation. The particular, toxic output that uncontrolled magical energy produced when a practitioner channeled power without the safety protocols that training prescribed.

Gravos was completely mad. The descriptor was clinical — the assessment that the intelligence reports provided based on the observation that the Ashvanar's behavior had exceeded the parameters that rational action produced. His brother's death had been the fracture. The war's progression had been the pressure. The siege's arrival had been the final stress that converted fracture into collapse.

He didn't want to win. The recognition was essential — the tactical assessment that determined the approach. Gravos was not defending the tower to protect the Dominion's position. He was not fighting to achieve a military objective. He wanted to burn everything. The particular, nihilistic fury that existed when a person's grief exceeded their capacity to process it and the overflow converted into the desire to make the world match the destruction that the grief had produced inside them.

He was going to overload the tower. The sorcery that he was pouring into the structure was not being deployed — it was being stored. Accumulated. The energy building toward the threshold that would convert the tower from a structure into a weapon. A suicide attack. The detonation that would occur when the stored energy exceeded the tower's structural capacity and the release was not a controlled deployment but an explosion.

The explosion could level a city block. The energy that Gravos had accumulated — the output of a powerful sorcerer operating at maximum capacity for hours — would produce a blast that exceeded anything conventional military demolition could generate. The blast would kill everyone within the radius — alliance soldiers, Dominion soldiers, civilians, the indiscriminate destruction that nihilistic fury produced.

Torvane took point. The engineer's assessment was immediate — the particular, professional evaluation that identified the problem as an engineering challenge rather than a combat situation. The tower's defenses were layers of magical energy. The overload was an energy accumulation problem. The solution was not force — it was technique.

"This is an engineering problem," Torvane said. The words were delivered with the particular, calm precision that the engineer maintained when the situation's severity demanded the clarity that panic would compromise. "Dismantle the defenses layer by layer without triggering the overload."

He deployed every device he had. The comprehensive arsenal that months of engineering had produced — the ward-disruptors, the signal-jammers, the energy-redirect panels that Torvane's inventive capability had created for exactly the variety of magical threats that the war's progression had presented.

Ward-disruptors targeted the outer layers. The devices that neutralized magical defenses — the technology that Torvane had refined through the war's progression — were deployed against the tower's outermost energy barriers. Each disruptor produced the particular, targeted interference that disrupted the ward's structural coherence without releasing the ward's stored energy. The distinction was critical — disrupting without releasing, neutralizing without detonating.

Signal-jammers interrupted the tower's energy flow. The devices that blocked magical communication — originally designed for intelligence operations — were repurposed as flow interrupters. Each jammer introduced noise into the energy channels that connected the tower's layers, reducing the efficiency of the energy transfer that the overload depended on.

Energy-redirect panels diverted the accumulated power. The panels — Torvane's most sophisticated creation — didn't block energy. They redirected it. The panels accepted the energy that the tower's layers released when the disruptors neutralized them and channeled it into the ground — the particular, controlled dissipation that converted dangerous energy into harmless heat.

Layer by layer. The tower's defenses peeled away — each one neutralized by the specific device that Torvane had designed for its particular characteristics. The process was methodical. Precise. The engineer's hands working the devices with the calloused, scarred precision that years of practice had produced.

The Ashvanar poured power into his tower. Gravos detected the dismantling — the sorcerer's awareness registering the systematic removal of the defenses that his madness had constructed. His response was not tactical — it was reactive. More power. More energy. The particular, escalating response that a maddened practitioner produced when their creation was threatened and the only answer their broken mind could generate was more.

The tower glowed brighter. Cracked. Shook. The structural integrity that the building's physical architecture provided was being exceeded by the energy that Gravos was forcing into it. The overload was accelerating — the energy accumulation approaching the threshold faster than the dismantling was reducing it.

"He's going to blow," Torvane said. The assessment was calm — the engineer's voice maintaining the particular, professional delivery that the situation's urgency demanded. The words were not panic. They were data. The observation that the energy accumulation's rate exceeded the dismantling's rate and that the intersection of the two rates was approaching the threshold that would produce the detonation.

Torvane activated his masterwork. The resonance inverter — the device that he had built for exactly this contingency, the engineering solution to the problem of a sorcerer who was willing to destroy himself and everything around him.

The inverter didn't block the sorcery. It turned it back on itself. The device produced a resonance frequency that reversed the direction of the tower's energy flow — converting the outward explosion that the overload would produce into an inward implosion that consumed the energy within the tower's own structure.

The reversal was instantaneous. The energy that Gravos had been accumulating — the massive, destructive force that would have leveled a city block — reversed direction. The explosion became an implosion. The force that would have radiated outward instead contracted inward — the energy consuming the space that contained it rather than the space that surrounded it.

The tower collapsed inward. The structure — undermined by the implosion that the inverter had produced — fell into itself. The building's physical architecture failed — the walls, the floors, the roof all drawn inward by the force that the reversed energy created. The collapse was contained — the implosion's inward direction preventing the debris from scattering and the energy from radiating.

The Ashvanar was crushed by his own power. Gravos — the grief-maddened sorcerer who had wanted to burn everything — was consumed by the implosion that his own energy had produced when Torvane's inverter turned it back on itself. The particular, devastating justice that existed when a weapon was reversed and the destruction that the wielder intended for others was delivered to the wielder instead.

Seventh villain defeat. The Ashvanar, crushed by his own power. Engineering defeats sorcery. Math defeats madness.

Torvane stood in the dust. The collapse had produced the cloud of debris that structural failure generated — the particles of stone and mortar and the particular, acrid dust that buildings produced when they fell. The dust settled around the engineer — the quiet aftermath that followed the controlled disaster that his device had prevented from becoming an uncontrolled one.

Untouched. The engineer stood in the destruction zone — the space that the tower's collapse had produced — without a scratch. The devices had worked. The dismantling had succeeded. The inverter had reversed the overload. The engineer's hands — the calloused, scarred, precise hands that had built every device and checked every bolt — had saved the army from a detonation that would have killed hundreds.

The quiet engineer just saved the army. With math. With devices. With the particular, essential capability that existed when a person cared enough about the people around them to build the tools that protected them.

The path was clear. The tower's destruction opened the approach to the palace complex — the final obstacle between the army and the Gate plaza eliminated by the engineer who solved problems with calculations rather than weapons.

Torvane looked at his hands. The hands that had given their need for control to the blade. The hands that now built with faith instead of certainty.

The hands were enough. They had always been enough.
