Chapter 12 - SERENTHAR'S CHAMBER

They descended into the depths beneath the palace and the darkness that met them was older than the empire that had built above it.

The corridors were narrow. The subterranean passages that connected the palace's surface levels to the underground chambers where the Dominion kept its most controlled assets — the particular, claustrophobic architecture that existed when builders constructed spaces designed for containment rather than habitation. The walls were stone — not the black volcanic rock of the palace above but older material, the grey limestone that pre-dated the Dominion's construction and that suggested the underground chambers had existed before the palace was built on top of them.

The air tasted of tears and old metal. The particular, distinctive atmosphere that the subterranean space produced — the combination of mineral moisture and the metallic tang that dimensional energy left in enclosed spaces. The taste was not physical — it was the sensory signature that the oracle's proximity produced, the way that centuries of concentrated prophetic vision altered the environment that contained it.

They descended in formation. Itzil at the front — the blade providing the nine-colored illumination that the corridors' darkness required. Kaelen beside her — the shadow-sense scanning the passages for threats that the darkness might conceal. Amalura behind them — the scholar whose knowledge of the palace's architecture guided the descent through the maze of corridors that the subterranean level contained.

The rest of the team held the throne room. Jagren guarding the captured Valdremor. Neyla treating the wounded. Rainara, Skyren, Zariel, Torvane, Solkren — each hero positioned at the posts that the palace's security required while the descent team sought the oracle.

They found Serenthar's chamber. The passage opened into a space that was not a room but a cavern — the natural formation that the palace's foundations had been built around, the underground void that pre-dated human construction and that the Dominion had repurposed as the oracle's containment.

Pitch black. The chamber's darkness was absolute — the absence of light that existed when a space was sealed from every external source and the only illumination was the blade's nine-colored glow. The light pushed the darkness back but couldn't fill the chamber — the space was too large, too deep, the void extending beyond the light's reach into the black distance that the cavern's natural dimensions provided.

A throne of black stone. At the chamber's center — visible in the blade's light, the dark mass that occupied the space's focal point. The throne was not constructed — it was carved from the cavern's natural stone, the seat shaped from the rock that the underground formation provided. The throne was ancient — older than the Dominion, older than the palace, the creation of a civilization that had occupied this space before the empire existed.

And on it: the Weeping Oracle.

Serenthar. As ancient and alien as the day she was first described in the series. The demon-bound seer whose visions had served the Dominion since her binding — the woman whose existence had been defined by the seeing of futures and the weeping that the seeing produced.

Her ember-red eyes glowed in the darkness. The demon-crystal prosthetics that replaced her natural eyes — the dimensional sight devices that the demon-bond had installed, the instruments that provided the prophetic vision that was simultaneously her gift and her prison. The eyes blazed with the particular, steady luminosity that dimensional energy produced — the red glow that existed in contrast to Valdremor's blue-white crystal, the color that the demon's nature imposed on the sight that the bond provided.

Her white hair pooled around her. The cascade of colorless hair that centuries of existence had produced — the particular, distinctive appearance that extreme age and dimensional exposure generated. The hair was not styled — it flowed from her head and across the throne and onto the floor, the length that centuries of growth had accumulated, the physical evidence of a person who had existed long enough for her body to produce a feature that no normal lifespan would allow.

Dark tears streaked her grey cheeks. The constant weeping that the prophetic vision produced — the tears that were not grief but overflow, the physical response of a consciousness processing more information than the body could contain. The tears were dark — the dimensional tint that the demon-bond imposed on every physical output, the evidence of the parasitic relationship that the bond maintained between the seer and the entity that powered her sight.

She spoke before they did. The particular, anticipatory communication that the prophetic vision produced — the response to a question that hadn't been asked because the asker's intention had been perceived before the asking.

"You've come to ask me how to close the Gate."

The words were delivered without drama — the simple statement of a fact that the oracle's vision had revealed and that the visitors' presence confirmed. The voice was steady — the particular, calm delivery that existed when a person who had seen every future spoke about the future that was approaching.

Itzil stepped forward. The commander — the blade blazing, the nine-colored light illuminating the oracle's ancient face — stood before the throne and asked the question that the war's endgame demanded.

"Can it be closed without someone going through?"

The question was direct. The particular, essential inquiry that the situation required — the assessment of whether Valdremor's claim was accurate, whether the Gate's closure demanded the sacrifice that the Architect had described, whether there was an alternative to the one-way trip that the offer had presented.

Serenthar wept harder. The tears — the dark overflow that the prophetic vision produced — increased in volume and frequency. The particular, devastating response that the oracle produced when the future she was perceiving contained information that the asker would not want to receive.

"No."

The single word settled into the chamber with the weight of centuries of certainty. The oracle's answer was not analysis — it was vision. The direct perception of every possible future, every permutation of every decision, every timeline that the war's endgame could produce. And in every timeline — in every version of the future that Serenthar's sight could perceive — the Gate's closure required someone to pass through it.

No alternative. No technique. No shortcut. The Gate had been opened from this side. It could only be closed from the other side. Someone had to walk through. Someone had to reach the keystone. Someone had to destroy it.

And someone had to stay.

The chamber was silent except for the oracle's weeping. The dark tears falling. The ember-red eyes blazing. The ancient woman on the ancient throne, bearing the weight of the knowledge that the heroes needed and that the heroes would wish she didn't have.

The answer was no. The Gate could not be closed without sacrifice.

Someone had to go through. Someone had to not come back.

The blade's light flickered. The nine soul-threads pulsing in the darkness — the collective heartbeat of nine people who had given pieces of themselves to the weapon and who were now facing the truth that the weapon's purpose demanded.

Someone.

The question of who hung in the dark air of the chamber like the oracle's tears — present, visible, and impossible to ignore.
