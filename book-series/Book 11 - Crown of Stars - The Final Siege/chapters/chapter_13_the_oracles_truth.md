Chapter 13 - THE ORACLE'S TRUTH

Serenthar had seen every future and in every one of them, someone walked through the Gate and didn't come back.

The oracle sat on her throne of black stone — the ancient seat in the ancient chamber, the position that she had occupied for centuries while the visions that the demon-bond provided filled her consciousness with every possible version of every possible event. The ember-red eyes blazed in the blade's nine-colored light. The dark tears fell. The white hair pooled around her like snow that had forgotten how to melt.

This was the first chapter entirely from Serenthar's perspective in full narrative — the interior view of the consciousness that had been the series' most enigmatic presence since her first mention. The Weeping Oracle. The demon-bound seer. The woman who cried because she saw too much.

She had seen every future. Every permutation. Every possibility. The prophetic vision that the demon-bond provided was not prediction — it was perception. The direct observation of every timeline that the present moment could produce, the simultaneous awareness of every version of every future that the current state of reality permitted. The vision was not selective — it showed everything. Every outcome. Every consequence. Every path.

In every future where the Gate closes, someone walks through it and doesn't come back. The consistency was absolute — the particular, unchanging element that persisted across every permutation of every timeline. The Gate's closure mechanism required physical interaction with the keystone — the original crystal that had been used to open the Gate centuries ago and that now existed on the other side of the dimensional portal, in Vastrix's domain. The keystone had to be destroyed. The destruction required a person's presence. The presence was a one-way trip.

She had been watching these heroes for months. The prophetic vision that perceived every future also perceived every present — the simultaneous awareness of current events that the demon-bond's temporal sight provided. She had watched them fight. She had watched them love — the particular, growing connection between Itzil and Kaelen that the war had forged. She had watched them grieve — Miyako's death, Korvain's death, the losses that the war had imposed. She had watched them persist — the particular, stubborn refusal to stop that characterized every member of the team.

She had watched Itzil grow. From a scared girl receiving a blade she didn't understand to a leader who carried nine souls and commanded an army. The transformation was visible in the oracle's sight — the timeline that showed the progression from uncertainty to authority, from dependence to independence, from the person who needed Korvain to the person who WAS what Korvain had taught her to be.

She had watched Kaelen learn to belong. The scout who had given his fear of belonging to the blade — the man who had spent years refusing connection and who had been taught by the war and the team and the woman he loved that connection was not vulnerability but strength.

She pities them. Genuinely. The emotion was not common for the oracle — the demon-bond's consumption of her emotional infrastructure had left limited capacity for the feelings that humans normally experienced. But pity persisted — the particular, surviving emotion that existed when a consciousness that saw all possible suffering was confronted with specific suffering and recognized its unfairness.

She had seen them suffer in every possible future. Every version of the timeline contained pain — the particular, unavoidable consequence of being human in a world that the Dominion had broken. The suffering varied — some timelines produced more, some less. But no timeline was free of it. The heroes would suffer regardless of the choices they made. The question was not whether they would suffer but how much and to what purpose.

But she had also seen something she hadn't shared with anyone. A future. One specific future among the infinite permutations that her vision perceived. A future that was different from the others in a way that the difference demanded she act.

A future where the heroes win AND the Dominion survives in a transformed form. A future where the cycle of war doesn't repeat. A future where the continent's political structure is rebuilt rather than destroyed and where the rebuilding produces a stability that is based on justice rather than control.

That future required a specific sacrifice. The sacrifice had to be willing — the voluntary act of a person who chose to walk through the Gate knowing they would not return. The willing nature was essential — the keystone responded to intention. A forced sacrifice would fail. A reluctant sacrifice would fail. Only a willing one — a person who chose the act freely, without coercion, without deception — would produce the resonance that the keystone's destruction required.

Serenthar made her choice. The decision that centuries of vision had been building toward — the moment that every future she had ever perceived had been converging on. The decision was not sudden — it was the culmination of centuries of observation, of watching the consequences that the Gate's existence produced, of understanding that the Gate was her responsibility because the Gate was her creation.

"The Gate must be closed from the inside," she told Itzil. The information that the heroes needed — the truth that the oracle's vision confirmed. "Someone has to go through. It's a one-way trip."

The words settled into the chamber with the weight that truth carried when truth was heavy and the hearer wished it were light.

She paused. The particular, dramatic pause that the oracle deployed when the information that followed would change everything — the moment's breath between the truth that had been spoken and the truth that was about to be.

"But I have seen every future," she said. "And in only one does this work."

She looked at Itzil. The ember-red eyes meeting the commander's gaze — the oracle's prophetic sight perceiving the particular future that this moment's decisions would produce. She looked at Kaelen — the scout standing beside the commander, the man whose belonging was written in the soul-thread that connected him to the blade and to the woman he loved. She looked at the space between them — the connection that her vision perceived as a golden thread, the relationship that the war had tested and that the testing had made unbreakable.

Then she smiled. The first time she had EVER smiled. The expression was not practiced — the muscles that produced it had not been used in centuries, the facial configuration that happiness generated unfamiliar to a face that had known only tears. The smile was small. Awkward. The particular, beautiful imperfection of a person experiencing an emotion for the first time in centuries.

"In that future," she said, "I am the one who walks through."

The words filled the chamber. The oracle's declaration — the volunteer's statement, the willing sacrifice's announcement. The words were not dramatic — they were quiet. The particular, calm delivery of a person who had made a decision that centuries of deliberation had produced and who was announcing the decision with the certainty that the deliberation justified.

She would walk through the Gate. She would find the keystone. She would destroy it. The Gate would close. Vastrix would be sealed.

And Serenthar would not come back.

The smile persisted. The ember-red eyes — for the first time in centuries — were not weeping. The tears had stopped. The overflow that the prophetic vision produced was stilled — the consciousness that had been processing every future simultaneously now focused on a single future. The one that she had chosen. The one that worked.

The relief was visible. The particular, profound release that existed when a person who had been carrying a weight for centuries was finally able to set it down. The weight was not the vision — the vision would persist until the demon-bond was broken. The weight was the indecision. The centuries of knowing that the Gate was her responsibility and not knowing when the moment to act would arrive.

The moment had arrived. The decision was made. The weight was set down.

The oracle smiled. The tears were still. The choice was made.

And in the chamber's darkness — in the ancient space beneath the palace, in the cavern where an oracle had wept for centuries — the future that worked began to take shape.
