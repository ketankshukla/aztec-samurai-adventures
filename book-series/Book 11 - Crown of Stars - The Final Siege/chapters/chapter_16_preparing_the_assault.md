Chapter 16 - PREPARING THE ASSAULT

Kaelen planned the final assault on the Great Gate plaza with the precision that had made him the army's most indispensable tactical mind.

The war council convened in the palace throne room — the space that Valdremor's capture had converted from the Dominion's seat of power into the alliance's command center. The obsidian throne was empty — the Architect restrained in an adjacent chamber under Jagren's guard. The stone table that the heroes assembled around held Skyren's maps and Kaelen's tactical diagrams and the intelligence products that the army's reconnaissance had accumulated.

The Gate plaza was fifty yards from the palace. The open space that contained the dimensional portal — the hundred-yard-wide ceremonial area that the capital's designers had placed at the city's center. The plaza was the final objective — the space that the assault had to secure, the position where Vastrix's manifestation would be engaged, the location where Serenthar would enter the Gate.

Kaelen's tactical plan divided the assault into three approach vectors — the coordinated advance that maximized the team's capabilities and minimized the exposure that the plaza's open space created.

Left flank: Rainara. The water-mystic would advance from the plaza's western approach — the route that the city's canal system provided, the water infrastructure that Rainara's magic could weaponize. Her role was containment — preventing Vastrix's tendrils from extending beyond the plaza's boundaries, protecting the army's flanking elements from the entity's dimensional attacks.

Right flank: Jagren with heavy infantry. The duelist would lead the alliance's remaining armored troops along the plaza's eastern approach — the wide avenue that the capital's ceremonial architecture provided. His role was pressure — the sustained offensive that would occupy the Dominion's remaining loyalist forces and prevent them from interfering with the central advance.

Center: Itzil with the blade. The commander would advance directly toward the Gate — the straight-line approach that the blade's defensive field required. The blade's nine soul-threads would provide the counter-frequency that pushed back Vastrix's psychic pressure, creating the zone of protection that the central assault force needed to reach the Gate.

Torvane deployed every remaining siege device. The engineer's arsenal — depleted by the siege's previous phases but still functional — was aimed at the Gate's physical structure. The ward-disruptors would weaken the dimensional barriers that the Gate's arch maintained. The explosive charges would stress the physical structure that the portal's dimensional architecture depended on. The communication arrays would coordinate the three-vector assault in real time.

Skyren would provide aerial support. The hawk rider — Cielovar's wings carrying her above the plaza — would dive-bomb any Dominion resistance that the three-vector advance encountered and drop signal charges that marked priority targets for the ground forces.

Neyla would work the rear. The healer's role was the particular, essential function that medical capability provided in the assault's final phase — treating the wounded, reversing any remaining blood-wards on captured soldiers, maintaining the army's combat effectiveness as casualties accumulated.

Zariel coordinated the full army. The diplomat — whose intelligence training included the organizational capability that large-scale military operations required — managed the thousands of soldiers whose combined effort would sustain the assault's three vectors.

Solkren stood with Itzil. The armorer's position was at the blade-bearer's side — the craftsman's proximity to the weapon he had forged, ready to maintain the blade if the Vastrix engagement damaged the dimensional architecture that the nine soul-threads depended on.

Amalura and Serenthar prepared the ritual. The scholar and the oracle — the two keepers of ancient knowledge, the intelligence that understood the Gate's dimensional engineering and the vision that perceived the mechanism's destruction sequence. The ritual was not magic — it was preparation. The dimensional adjustment that would allow Serenthar to survive the transition through the Gate long enough to reach the keystone.

The preparation was clinical. Amalura's analytical mind processing the dimensional variables with the particular, systematic methodology that decades of scholarship provided. Serenthar's prophetic vision guiding the preparation toward the specific configuration that the future she had chosen required. The scholar and the oracle worked in concert — the particular, productive collaboration that existed when two minds with complementary capabilities applied themselves to a shared objective.

Sunset arrived. The fissure's red light — which had been competing with the daylight that the sun provided — dominated the sky as the sun descended below the horizon. The transition from day to night was dramatic — the natural light fading and the dimensional illumination from Vastrix's domain replacing it with the particular, wrong quality that extra-dimensional light possessed.

The Starless Crown was ninety-five percent complete. The void — the ring of darkness that had been consuming stars since Book 4 — was approaching closure. The gap in the Crown — the remaining five percent of the sky that the void hadn't consumed — was visible above the capital. The stars that occupied the gap were the last stars — the final points of natural light in a sky that the Dominion's operations had been eating.

Red light flooded the capital. The fissure's illumination — intensified by the Crown's near-completion, amplified by the proximity that the capital's position beneath the dimensional stress fracture provided — cast the city in crimson. The buildings, the streets, the plaza that the assault would target — all of it rendered in the blood-red light that Vastrix's domain produced.

Vastrix's shadow filled the fissure. The entity — pressing harder as the barrier weakened, approaching the threshold that would allow full manifestation — was visible through the crack in reality. The shadow was enormous — the silhouette that occupied the fissure's entire width, the shape that the entity produced when it pressed against the barrier with the maximum force that its hunger could generate.

Tomorrow. Either the world was saved or it ended. The binary that the war's endgame had produced — the two outcomes that every timeline contained, the fork in reality that tomorrow's battle would determine.

The team prepared. Each hero in their assigned position — the tactical arrangement that Kaelen's plan prescribed, the deployment that would carry the assault from inception to objective. The preparations were professional. Methodical. The particular, disciplined activity that military forces performed when the engagement was imminent and the margin between preparation and unpreparedness was the margin between survival and death.

The sunset faded. The red light remained. The Crown consumed. The shadow pressed.

Tomorrow.

The final battle. The Gate. The hunger. The blade.

Nine heroes. One oracle. One chance.

Tomorrow, everything would be decided.
