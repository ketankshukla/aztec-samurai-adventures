Chapter 18 - DALRIGNON'S LAST STAND

Dawn broke red and the army advanced on the Gate plaza and the plaza's approaches were a killing field of spatial distortion.

Dalrignon — the portal engineer, the Dominion's specialist in dimensional transit technology — had fortified the plaza's approaches with the particular, devastating weapon that his expertise provided: micro-portals. The small-scale dimensional gateways that Dalrignon's craft produced were deployed across the ground that the assault force had to cross — invisible, undetectable by conventional means, the particular, lethal traps that converted the plaza's stone floor into a minefield where the mines teleported rather than exploded.

Soldiers stepped on the micro-portals and vanished. The transit was instantaneous — the unfortunate person's body displaced from the plaza's surface to the destination that Dalrignon's engineering had programmed. The destinations were lethal: into walls — the soldier materialized inside the solid stone that the plaza's surrounding buildings provided. Into the sky — the soldier appeared at altitude with nothing beneath them but the ground that the fall would deliver them to. Into the ground — the soldier was teleported below the plaza's surface, entombed in the stone that the capital's foundations contained.

The killing field was invisible. The micro-portals produced no visual signature — the dimensional gateways too small and too brief to generate the distortion that larger portals displayed. The soldiers who triggered them simply vanished — one step on the wrong stone and the person was gone, relocated to a destination that killed them.

The advance stalled. The first wave — the soldiers who led the three-vector assault — encountered the micro-portals and the casualties were immediate and incomprehensible. Men and women who had survived the outer ring, the street fighting, the inner wall, the palace district — vanished mid-step. The particular, devastating loss that occurred when the threat was invisible and the response was impossible because the threat couldn't be detected until it was triggered.

Torvane assessed. The engineer's perception — the analytical capability that identified problems as engineering challenges and solutions as engineering responses — evaluated the micro-portal field with the professional attention that the threat's complexity demanded.

The portals were Dalrignon's masterwork. The dimensional engineering that produced micro-scale transit gateways — the particular, sophisticated technology that compressed full-scale portal capability into devices that were nearly undetectable. The engineering was brilliant. The application was lethal. The combination was the most dangerous non-Vastrix threat that the final assault would encounter.

Torvane countered. The resonance inverter — the device that had defeated the Ashvanar's sorcery tower — was recalibrated for portals. The inverter's fundamental principle — the reversal of energy flow direction — was applicable to dimensional transit: instead of reversing sorcery's direction, it reversed the portals' transit vector.

The recalibration was precise. Torvane's hands — the calloused, scarred, precise instruments that had built every device the army depended on — adjusted the inverter's dimensional frequency to match the micro-portals' transit signature. The adjustment required the particular, expert knowledge that Torvane's engineering training provided — the understanding of dimensional mechanics that allowed him to identify the frequency that the portals operated on and to produce the counter-frequency that reversed their function.

He activated the inverter. The device produced the resonance field that the recalibration had prepared — the dimensional counter-frequency that interacted with Dalrignon's micro-portals and reversed their transit vectors.

The reversal was elegant. Instead of teleporting soldiers INTO walls, the inverted portals now teleported soldiers THROUGH them. The transit that had been lethal — relocating people into solid objects — was reversed into transit that was useful — relocating people through solid objects, bypassing the barriers that the plaza's architecture provided.

The alliance soldiers stepped on the micro-portals and appeared on the other side of the walls that the portals had been programmed to send them into. Instead of materializing inside the stone, they materialized beyond it — the transit completing through the wall rather than into it, the soldiers emerging on the far side of the barriers that had been their intended tombs.

Dalrignon panicked. The portal engineer — whose micro-portal field had been his defensive masterpiece, the weapon that should have stopped the assault before it reached the Gate — discovered that his portals were being turned against him. The soldiers he was trying to kill were being transported through his defenses instead — the micro-portals converting from a killing field into a transportation network that the alliance was using to bypass every physical obstacle between them and the Gate.

He tried to stabilize. The engineer's response to the inverter's disruption was the recalibration that his expertise provided — the adjustment of the micro-portals' frequency to counteract the resonance that Torvane's device was producing. The recalibration required power — the dimensional energy that portal adjustment demanded, the output that Dalrignon's personal reserves and the Gate's proximity provided.

He overcharged the network. The power that the recalibration required exceeded the micro-portals' design parameters — the energy that Dalrignon was forcing through the system exceeding the capacity that the small-scale gateways could sustain. The overcharge built — the energy accumulating in the network's infrastructure, the dimensional force exceeding the structural limits that the portals' engineering had established.

Torvane saw the overcharge building. The engineer's perception — the diagnostic capability that identified energy accumulation and projected its consequences — detected the overcharge's progression with the particular, precise timing that the response required.

"He's going to blow," Torvane said. The assessment was familiar — the same observation that the Ashvanar's tower had produced, the recognition of an energy accumulation approaching the threshold that would convert stored power into destructive release.

He redirected the overcharge. The inverter — recalibrated one final time — channeled the accumulated energy into Dalrignon's own anchor crystal. The anchor — the central node that the micro-portal network depended on, the device that Dalrignon maintained as the control point for every portal in the field — received the redirected overcharge with the particular, catastrophic result that energy exceeding design parameters produced.

The crystal imploded. The anchor — overloaded by the energy that Torvane had redirected into it — collapsed inward. The implosion was contained — the energy consuming the crystal and the space around it rather than radiating outward. The micro-portal network, deprived of its anchor, failed simultaneously — every portal in the field deactivating as the control node that sustained them was destroyed.

Dalrignon was caught in the implosion. The portal engineer — standing beside his anchor crystal, attempting the recalibration that would have restored his network — was consumed by the collapse of his own creation. The implosion that destroyed the anchor crystal destroyed the engineer with it — the person and the mechanism eliminated together by the energy that the person had been trying to control.

Ninth villain defeat. Dalrignon, consumed by the portal collapse. The engineer defeated by the engineer — Torvane's devices countering Dalrignon's devices, the alliance's technology overcoming the Dominion's technology, the quiet craftsman defeating the lethal specialist with the resonance inverter that care and precision had built.

The plaza approaches were clear. The micro-portal field was deactivated. The spatial distortion that had converted the approaches into a killing field was eliminated. The path to the Gate was open.

Torvane stood at the plaza's edge. The inverter in his hands — the device that had defeated two villain engineers in a single siege. The calloused, scarred, precise hands that had built it steady and sure.

The Gate was ahead. Fifty yards of open plaza. The arch of black stone. The fissure blazing above. The shadow pressing through.

The path was clear. The final battle was at hand.
