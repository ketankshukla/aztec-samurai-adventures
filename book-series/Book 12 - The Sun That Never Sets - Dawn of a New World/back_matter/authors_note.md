# Author's Note

Thank you for reading *The Sun That Never Sets*. Thank you for reading all twelve books.

This is the book where the fighting stops and the living starts. The book where swords become plowshares and blades become door hinges and the people who saved the world figure out what to do with the world they saved.

Every hero found their place. Itzil became a teacher. Kaelen built a home. Jagren learned discipline. Neyla trained healers. Rainara found peace. Torvane drew blueprints. Skyren flew free. Zariel built bridges. Solkren made hinges. Amalura preserved knowledge.

The memorial doesn't sort names by side. Because in death, there are no sides. Only people who were here, and what they did with the time they had.

And then — a shard. A child. A light older than everything. A door that has never been opened beginning to open.

The series is over. But the world isn't.

I wrote this series because I believe in showing up. I believe that the measure of a person is not the victories they accumulate but the people they protect. I believe that courage is not the absence of fear but the decision to show up when you're terrified. I believe that the ordinary — the sunset, the stars, the quiet dinner, the house with a view — is the most precious thing in the world because the ordinary is the world.

Show up. Give willingly. Choose each other.

The sun never sets on those who refuse to kneel.

With love and gratitude,
Ketan Shukla
