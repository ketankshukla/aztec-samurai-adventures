# A Quick Favor

If you've been here since Book 1 — if you walked every step of this journey with Itzil and Kaelen and the team — would you consider leaving a review on Amazon?

Reviews help other readers find the series. And they help me know that the story landed.

Even a single sentence:

> *"Show up. Every time. I did — for twelve books. And it was worth it."*

Thank you for reading. Thank you for showing up.

The sun never sets on those who refuse to kneel.

— Ketan
