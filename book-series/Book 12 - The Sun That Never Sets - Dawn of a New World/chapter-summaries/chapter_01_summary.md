# Chapter 1 Summary — DAWN

**POV:** Itzil

The morning after. Capital silent for the first time in decades. Golden snow — shattered Starless Crown. Gate is rubble. Sky is clear blue. Itzil exhausted. Blade faintly glowing. Nine soul-threads intact — everyone survived.

Army stirs. Soldiers who braced for death realize they're alive. Cheering mixed with crying. Kaelen appears: "It's over." Itzil: "Is it?" Kaelen: "The fighting is. The rest starts now."

**Key Events:** War's end confirmed, golden snow falls, all heroes survived, the rest begins.
