# Chapter 2 Summary — THE CAPTURED

**POV:** Zariel

Zariel manages aftermath's political dimension. Prisoners to process, surrenders to accept, power vacuum to manage. Valdremor cooperative but not repentant — acknowledges new reality with cold logic.

Gravok brought from prison. Hasn't seen sunlight in over a year. "Is it over?" "Can I see the sunrise?" They let him. Tears on his face. Zariel sorts prisoners: war criminals, reluctant participants, coerced servants.

**Key Events:** Political aftermath begins, Valdremor cooperates, Gravok sees sunrise, prisoner categorization.
