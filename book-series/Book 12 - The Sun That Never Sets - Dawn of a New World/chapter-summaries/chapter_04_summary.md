# Chapter 4 Summary — JAGREN'S RECKONING

**POV:** Jagren

Jagren walks the battlefield counting the dead. Stands where the Ashvanar brothers fell. Doesn't feel victorious. Feels heavy.

Young soldier: "You saved us. Everywhere." Jagren: "I lost people everywhere too." Soldier: "But you came back every time." Jagren: "Yeah. I came back." Puts away his dueling blade. Will teach discipline, not glory.

**Key Events:** Battlefield reckoning, weight of losses, young soldier's recognition, transition to teaching.
