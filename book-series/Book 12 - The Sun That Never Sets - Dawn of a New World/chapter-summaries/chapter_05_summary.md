# Chapter 5 Summary — RAINARA HEALS THE WATER

**POV:** Rainara

Rainara kneels at the capital's river — tainted by Gate corruption for years. Purifies with patience, not force. Strand by strand, layer by layer. Hours.

Water clears: muddy brown, grey, clear, sparkling. She drinks. It tastes clean. Other water-workers join. By sunset, river runs clear for first time in a generation. Fish appear. For the first time since captivity, Rainara feels peace.

**Key Events:** River purified, collaborative water-working, fish return, peace found.
