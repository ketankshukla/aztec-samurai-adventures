# Chapter 6 Summary — TORVANE REBUILDS

**POV:** Torvane

Torvane surveys damage. Plans reconstruction — not repairs, improvements. Dominion built for control; he rebuilds for community. Recruits surrendered Dominion engineers. First project: water system with Rainara. Clean water to ALL districts equally.

Draws blueprints by candlelight. Elegant, efficient, humane. He was always building for this — not weapons, but buildings. Homes. The things people need to live.

**Key Events:** Infrastructure assessment, community-first design, water system redesign, blueprints drawn.
