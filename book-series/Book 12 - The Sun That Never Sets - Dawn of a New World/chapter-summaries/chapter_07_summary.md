# Chapter 7 Summary — SKYREN'S LAST FLIGHT

**POV:** Skyren

Last reconnaissance — not for war, for closure. From altitude: smoke clearing, refugees returning, banners coming down. Scars: burned cities, empty villages. But also: people planting in ashes, markets opening, children playing in ruins.

Flies over Miyako's city. Temple cleared. Someone planted flowers where she fell. Returns: "The world is still here. It's hurt. But it's here." Cielovar cries once — clear, high, free.

**Key Events:** Continental aerial survey, war's cost visible, recovery beginning, Miyako's memorial.
