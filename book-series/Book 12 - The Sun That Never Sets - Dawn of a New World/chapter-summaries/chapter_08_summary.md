# Chapter 8 Summary — SOLKREN IN PEACE

**POV:** Solkren

Solkren forges tools, not weapons. Hammers, plowshares, nails, hinges. People come to his forge — not for repairs, but to be near the armorer who forged the blade. He's uncomfortable but doesn't hide anymore.

A child watches him work. "What are you making?" "A hinge." "For what?" "A door. Someone's going home and they need a door that opens." A door will swing on this for fifty years. He smiles.

**Key Events:** Peacetime forging, visibility accepted, hinge for a homecoming, contentment found.
