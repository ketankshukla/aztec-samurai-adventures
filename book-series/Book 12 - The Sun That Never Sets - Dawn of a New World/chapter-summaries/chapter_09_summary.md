# Chapter 9 Summary — AMALURA ENDURES

**POV:** Amalura

Amalura catalogs the Dominion palace library — largest collection on the continent. Every text a life saved. Mid-eighties, frailer than ever, but mind is a fortress. Dictates to three scribes simultaneously.

Finds Valdremor's journals. Brilliant and horrifying. Annotates: "Correct, but morally catastrophic." "Elegant solution to the wrong problem." Whispers to absent Korvain: "We did it, old friend." Nods once, firmly. Goes back to work.

**Key Events:** Library preservation, Valdremor's journals annotated, Korvain remembered, work continues.
