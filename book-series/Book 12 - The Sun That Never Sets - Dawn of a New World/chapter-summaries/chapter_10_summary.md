# Chapter 10 Summary — VALDREMOR'S SILENCE

**POV:** Valdremor (Villain)

Last villain POV. Clean cell. Reviews his life analytically. The one variable he never modeled: the heroes' love for each other. Thinks about Amalura — feels something unfamiliar. Respect. Possibly admiration.

Guard opens window shutters. Sunlight floods the cell. Valdremor closes his eyes. For the first time, nothing to build. In the silence, something that might be peace settles over him.

**Key Events:** Analytical self-review, love as unmeasured variable, Amalura respected, peace found in silence.
