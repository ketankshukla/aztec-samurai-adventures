# Chapter 11 Summary — THE FREED

**POV:** Neyla

Ceremony at Gate plaza — rubble cleared, memorial garden planted. Thousands of freed ash-oath slaves attend. Neyla: "You remember your names. That's the first step."

A mother with her freed daughter: "You gave me back my daughter." Neyla: "You held onto her. I just helped you find the grip." Each freed person says their name aloud. Thousands. Hours. No one leaves. Applause — the sound of people acknowledging each other's existence.

**Key Events:** Memorial garden ceremony, names spoken aloud, collective acknowledgment, Neyla's tears.
