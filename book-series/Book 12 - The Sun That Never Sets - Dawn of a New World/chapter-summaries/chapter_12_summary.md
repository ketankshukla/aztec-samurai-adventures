# Chapter 12 Summary — GRAVOK'S SUNRISE

**POV:** Itzil

Itzil visits Gravok. He's changed — tired man who misses the sky. "Was it worth it?" "No. I only knew the roar of battle. It sounds like purpose. It's not."

"I want to see the sunrise." She nods to guards: open the window. Dawn light floods his face. Ten minutes without moving. Eyes wet. "I forgot what it looked like." Itzil: "Don't forget again." The window stays open.

**Key Events:** Gravok's transformation, sunrise request granted, difference between justice and cruelty.
