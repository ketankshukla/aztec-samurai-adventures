# Chapter 13 Summary — POLITICAL SETTLEMENT

**POV:** Zariel

Zariel leads peace negotiations. Representatives from every nation. Brutal discussions — reparations, territory, justice, revenge. Zariel: "Fairness is what we build over decades. Today, we build the framework."

Dominion territories reorganized as independent nations with oversight. War criminals face tribunals. Coerced soldiers receive amnesty. Valdremor stands trial for enslavement. Peace accord signed. Not perfect. Never will be. A beginning.

**Key Events:** Peace negotiations, framework established, accord signed, justice framework created.
