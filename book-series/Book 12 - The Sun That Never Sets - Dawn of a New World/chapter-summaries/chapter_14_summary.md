# Chapter 14 Summary — ITZIL'S CHOICE

**POV:** Itzil

Allied nations offer Itzil a crown. She refuses: "I didn't fight a war against a tyrant to become one." Proposes instead: a Sun-Blade Academy. Not warriors — teachers. Based on Korvain's principles.

Places the blade on an open stand — where anyone can touch it. "This blade belongs to nine people. It doesn't need a sheath. It needs an open door."

**Key Events:** Crown refused, academy founded, blade displayed openly, teaching begins.
