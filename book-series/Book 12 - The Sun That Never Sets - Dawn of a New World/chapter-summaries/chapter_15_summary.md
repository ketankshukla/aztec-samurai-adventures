# Chapter 15 Summary — KAELEN'S PURPOSE

**POV:** Kaelen

Kaelen builds an intelligence network — not for war, for prevention. Early warning systems, diplomatic observation posts. Headquarters near the academy. Close enough to walk home for dinner.

Miyako's lesson: "Walk in light." He spent his life in shadows. Now uses shadows to protect the light. Hangs a map — every nation, every flashpoint. And one small house with a view. Home.

**Key Events:** Prevention network built, shadows protecting light, map with home marked.
