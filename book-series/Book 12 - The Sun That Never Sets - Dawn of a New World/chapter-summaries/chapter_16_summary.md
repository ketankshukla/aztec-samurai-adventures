# Chapter 16 Summary — THE MEMORIAL

**POV:** Itzil

Memorial built on the Gate site. Obsidian pillars. Thousands of names — heroes and villains, soldiers and civilians. Not sorted by side. Korvain's name. Miyako's name. Serenthar's (controversial — Itzil insisted). Helisar's (freed slaves insisted).

"In death, there are no sides. Only people who were here." Itzil places hand on Korvain's name: "I showed up. Every time." She can almost hear him: "I know."

**Key Events:** Memorial ceremony, unsorted names, Korvain remembered, universal acknowledgment.
