# Chapter 18 Summary — AMALURA'S LIBRARY

**POV:** Amalura

Amalura establishes the Great Library in the Dominion capital. Thousands of texts from both sides. Sun-Blade sacred texts next to Valdremor's journals. History doesn't choose favorites. Trains young scholars — prickly, demanding, the best teacher they'll ever have.

Young scholar: "What's the most important text?" Amalura: "The one that hasn't been written yet." She sits in her study. Content. She earned this.

**Key Events:** Great Library established, comprehensive collection, next generation trained, contentment.
