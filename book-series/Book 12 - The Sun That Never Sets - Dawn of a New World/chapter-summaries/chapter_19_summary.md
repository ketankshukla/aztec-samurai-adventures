# Chapter 19 Summary — ITZIL AND KAELEN

**POV:** Itzil

Three years after the war. Married — simply, privately, team present. House with a view. Quiet, steady, strong relationship. Argue about strategy at dinner. Train together at dawn. Sit on porch at sunset.

Itzil runs the academy — teaches presence, not perfection. Kaelen runs the network — comes home with intelligence reports and wine. "We did it." "Now we make sure no one has to do it again."

**Key Events:** Marriage, domestic life, academy and network running, purpose defined.
