# Chapter 20 Summary — FIVE YEARS LATER

**POV:** Multiple (extended vignettes)

Five years. Peace has held. Nations trade, argue, cooperate — messy, imperfect, alive. Neyla's academy: hundreds of healers trained. Torvane's rebuilt capital: beautiful. Rainara's oceans: clear continent-wide. Skyren's hawk network: messages everywhere.

Gravok released — trains war-beasts for agriculture. They pull plows now. Valdremor still imprisoned, writes philosophy. The scars are growing over. Green where there was ash. Laughter where there were screams.

**Key Events:** Continental recovery, all institutions thriving, Gravok released, scars healing.
