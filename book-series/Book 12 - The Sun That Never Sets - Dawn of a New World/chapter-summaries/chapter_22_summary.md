# Chapter 22 Summary — TEN YEARS LATER

**POV:** Itzil

Ten years. Itzil in her thirties — still strong, still sharp, but gentler. Kaelen's hair grey at temples. Still can't cook. A good life — morning training, afternoon teaching, evening walks, quiet dinners.

Visits Amalura — late eighties, writing the definitive history. "Am I in it?" "Everyone is in it. That's the point." Itzil stands on the balcony. Below: students laughing. Above: a sky full of stars. Every single one. No void. No crown. Just light.

**Key Events:** Decade of peace, domestic life, Amalura's history, stars fully restored.
