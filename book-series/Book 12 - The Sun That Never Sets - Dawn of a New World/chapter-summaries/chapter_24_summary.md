# Chapter 24 Summary — THE SHARD

**POV:** Unknown

Sequel tease. Somewhere far away — unmapped, barren, colorless. A child walks alone through a landscape older than the Gate.

Finds a shard of obsidian in the dirt. It pulses. Faint light — not golden, not red. Something else. Something older. A whisper — not words, a feeling. A pull. She closes her hand. The light grows. Warm. She smiles.

The series is over. But a door — somewhere, somewhen — has just opened.

**Key Events:** Unknown child, ancient obsidian shard, light older than everything, new door opens, series ends with possibility.
