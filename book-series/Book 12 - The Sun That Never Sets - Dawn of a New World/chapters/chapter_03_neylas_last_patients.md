Chapter 3 - NEYLA'S LAST PATIENTS

Neyla worked without rest because the wounded didn't stop being wounded when the war stopped being fought.

The medical aftermath was staggering. Thousands of wounded — the casualties that the siege's progression had produced, the injured from both sides of the conflict accumulating in the medical facilities that the alliance's healers had established in the capital's secured buildings. Alliance soldiers. Dominion soldiers. Freed ash-oath slaves. Civilians who had been caught in the street fighting. The particular, indiscriminate population that war's violence produced when the violence occurred in an urban environment and the distinction between combatant and non-combatant was blurred by proximity.

Neyla moved through the medical tents with the turquoise light that had become her signature — the healer's energy that connected her to every patient she touched, the power that had freed thousands from the ash-oaths and that now performed the more conventional healing that the wounded required. The turquoise light was steady — the healer's reserves replenished by the days of recovery that the siege's pauses had provided, the energy available for the sustained medical effort that the aftermath demanded.

The ash-oath reversals continued. With the Gate destroyed — the dimensional portal that had been the oaths' power source eliminated — the bindings were weaker. Many dissolved on their own — the oaths' dimensional connections failing as the infrastructure that sustained them collapsed. The cascade that Neyla had initiated in the Mirror-Realm continued its progression — each failed oath weakening the next, the chain reaction propagating through the remnants of the system that the Gate's destruction had undermined.

Others needed Neyla's touch. The oaths in the most heavily reinforced facilities — the bindings that the Dominion's most skilled practitioners had installed, the connections that were designed to resist the weakening that network disruption produced — persisted despite the Gate's destruction. These oaths required individual reversal — the personal application of the turquoise light that Neyla's technique provided.

She found the last ash-oath factory. A small one — hidden in the capital's basement levels, the subterranean space that the Dominion's security architecture had concealed from the siege's advance. The facility was modest — a single room, the equipment that the binding process required, the particular, clinical arrangement that the conversion of free people into enslaved consciousnesses demanded.

Dozens of slaves remained. Still blank-eyed — the particular, devastating emptiness that the ash-oath produced in the consciousness that it suppressed. The slaves stood in the facility's holding area — the space that the process's logistics required, the waiting room where the people who had been stolen waited for the use that their stolen consciousness would be put to.

She freed them one by one. The turquoise light applied to each individual — the personal, direct contact that the reversal required, the healer's hand on the patient's skin, the energy flowing from the practitioner's reserves into the binding's dimensional structure and dissolving it. Each reversal was a person restored — a consciousness returned to the body that had been operating without it.

Each one woke crying. The particular, universal response that the ash-oath's reversal produced — the tears that existed when a consciousness that had been suppressed was suddenly restored and the first sensation that the restored awareness processed was the recognition of what had been done. The crying was not sadness — it was overflow. The emotional response to the simultaneous experience of loss and recovery, the tears that the body produced when the feelings were too large for any other expression.

A freed woman grabbed Neyla's hand. The contact was desperate — the grip of a person who had been drowning and who had found something solid. The woman's eyes were wet — the tears that the reversal had produced flowing freely, the physical evidence of the emotional storm that the restoration was generating.

"I remember my daughter's name," the woman said.

The words were the particular, devastating statement that encapsulated everything the ash-oath system had taken and everything the reversal had returned. The woman's daughter's name — the most fundamental piece of information that a parent possessed, the word that connected a mother to her child — had been stolen by the oath. The reversal had returned it. The name was remembered.

Neyla held her. The healer's arms around the freed woman — the physical contact that communicated the particular, essential message that healing required: you are here. You are real. The thing that was taken from you has been returned.

"Tell me," Neyla said.

The woman said the name. The word — the daughter's name, the particular, irreplaceable sound that identified a specific person — was spoken in the subterranean room where the woman had been held. The word filled the space with the particular, warm quality that names produced when they were spoken by the people who loved the named.

Neyla repeated it. The healer's voice giving the name back — the particular, healing act of acknowledgment that converted the remembered name from a private recovery into a shared reality. The name existed again. Spoken by two voices. Present in the world.

The woman smiled. The first smile in months — the facial expression that the ash-oath's suppression had prevented and that the reversal's restoration had made possible again. The smile was not happiness — it was recognition. The particular, profound response that existed when a person who had lost everything recovered the one thing that mattered most.

Neyla worked until every slave in the facility was freed. The turquoise light moving from person to person — each reversal a life restored, each freed consciousness a victory that no battlefield triumph could match. The work was not dramatic — it was medical. The particular, essential function that healing performed when it encountered harm and responded with the care that harm's presence demanded.

Then she slept. For the first time in three days — the sustained wakefulness that the medical emergency had demanded finally yielding to the body's absolute requirement for rest. Neyla collapsed onto a cot in the medical tent — the physical surrender that exhaustion produced when the adrenaline that had been sustaining function was finally depleted.

When she woke, the ward was quiet. The particular, peaceful silence that existed when a medical facility's crisis had passed and the patients who remained were stable and the staff who attended them were competent. The quiet was different from the quiet of the morning after — this quiet was not the absence of war but the presence of healing. The sound of a world that was getting better.

Healing continued without her. The trained healers — the practitioners that Neyla had instructed during the campaign, the medical staff who had learned the reversal technique from her teaching — were performing the work that the remaining patients required. The healers moved through the ward with the competence that training produced — each one carrying the turquoise light's principles if not its specific manifestation, each one applying the healing philosophy that Neyla's instruction had transmitted.

Her legacy wasn't just her hands. It was the hands she taught. The particular, essential truth that the best healers understood — that the measure of a healer was not the number of patients they personally treated but the number of healers they trained to treat patients without them. Neyla's hands had freed thousands. The hands she had taught would free thousands more. And the hands that those hands taught would free thousands more after that.

The cascade of healing — not the dimensional cascade that had freed the Mirror-Realm's prisoners, but the human cascade of knowledge transferred and capability multiplied — was Neyla's true legacy. The healer who healed. And who taught others to heal. And who ensured that the healing would continue after her hands were still.

The ward was quiet. The healing continued. The healer slept.

And in the dreams that the exhausted sleep produced — the particular, vivid imagery that the mind generated when the body was depleted and the consciousness was free — Neyla saw the golden web. The soul-threads that connected every living thing — the beautiful, devastating evidence of the connection that existed between every person and that her new sight made visible.

The web was brighter than it had been during the war. The golden threads that connected the people in the ward — the patients, the healers, the staff — were stronger, more luminous, the particular quality that connection produced when the threat that had been testing it was removed and the connection was free to express its natural strength.

The world was healing. One person at a time. One name at a time. One hand at a time.

And the healer who had started the healing slept in the quiet ward and dreamed of golden light.
