Chapter 4 - JAGREN'S RECKONING

Jagren walked the battlefield and counted the dead because someone should.

The Gate plaza and the surrounding streets — the spaces where the siege's final phases had been fought — contained the evidence of the war's cost. The bodies had been collected — the medical teams and the burial details performing the grim, essential work that battles' aftermaths demanded. But the evidence remained. The bloodstains on the stone. The weapons discarded by soldiers who would never retrieve them. The particular, scattered detritus that combat produced when the combat was finished and the people who had produced the detritus were gone.

Jagren walked through it. The duelist — whose transformation from glory-seeker to protector had been one of the war's most dramatic evolutions — moved through the battlefield's aftermath with the particular, deliberate pace that counting required. He counted the bloodstains. He counted the discarded weapons. He counted the places where people had fallen and the stone bore the marks of the falling.

He didn't know why he was counting. The compulsion was not analytical — the numbers that the counting produced served no tactical or strategic purpose. The compulsion was personal — the particular, human need to acknowledge what had happened by giving it a number. A number was a measure. A measure was an acknowledgment. An acknowledgment was the minimum that the dead deserved.

He found the spot where the Ashvanar brothers had fallen. The first one — killed in Book 4, the battle that had been one of Jagren's early confrontations with the Dominion's most powerful combatants. The second — crushed in Book 11, the sorcery tower that Torvane's resonance inverter had imploded. Two brothers. Two deaths. Two points on the battlefield's map where the Dominion's sorcerous capability had been eliminated.

Jagren stood there for a long time. The particular, extended stillness that existed when a person was processing something that the processing required duration for — the thoughts that couldn't be compressed into a moment and that demanded the time that reflection provided.

He had killed the first one. The memory was specific — the combat's details preserved in the duelist's trained recollection with the precision that years of arena fighting had developed. The strike. The angle. The resistance. The particular, unmistakable sensation of a weapon finding its target and the target failing to survive the finding.

He didn't feel victorious. The emotion that the memory's recollection produced was not triumph — not the exultation that arena victories had generated, not the particular, addictive rush that the crowd's applause had provided. The emotion was weight. The particular, heavy sensation that existed when a person who had taken lives acknowledged the taking and recognized that the acknowledgment didn't diminish the weight.

He felt heavy. The weight of every life he took. Every life he couldn't save. The accumulated cost that the war had imposed on a man who had entered it seeking glory and who had discovered that glory was the wrong word for what combat provided.

A young soldier approached. The soldier was barely seventeen — the particular, devastating youth that existed when military forces recruited from populations that included people who were not yet adults. The soldier's face was marked by the battle's evidence — the cuts, the bruises, the exhaustion that the siege had imposed on everyone who had participated.

"You're Jagren? The duelist?"

The question was delivered with the particular, awed tone that recognition produced when a person encountered someone whose reputation preceded them. Jagren's combat capability — the dueling skill that had been demonstrated across the war's progression — had produced the reputation that young soldiers recognized and that the recognition invested with the particular, idealized quality that reputation provided.

"I was," Jagren said. The correction was not modesty — it was accuracy. The person who stood on the battlefield counting the dead was not the duelist who had entered the war seeking glory. The transformation that the war had produced — the conversion from glory-seeker to protector, from performer to servant — had changed the identity that the name referred to. Jagren the duelist was a previous version. The current version was something else.

"You saved us," the soldier said. "At the fortress. At the wall. Everywhere."

The assessment was the young soldier's experience — the particular, personal evidence of Jagren's combat capability deployed in the service of the soldiers who fought alongside him. The saving was real. The fortress, the wall, the everywhere — the locations where Jagren's sword had stood between the enemy and the people behind him.

"I lost people everywhere too," Jagren said.

The counter-assessment was equally real. The losses that accompanied the savings — the people who died despite the protection that Jagren's capability provided, the soldiers whose lives the duelist's sword couldn't preserve. The saving and the losing were simultaneous — the dual reality of combat that the young soldier's idealized assessment had omitted and that Jagren's experience required him to include.

"But you came back every time," the soldier said.

The observation was accurate. The particular, essential truth that the young soldier had identified — not the glory that Jagren had sought, not the victory that combat provided, but the return. The showing up. The particular, stubborn refusal to stop coming back that had been Jagren's defining quality through the war's progression.

Jagren looked at the young soldier. Saw himself — the version of himself that had existed before the war, before the blood, before the transformation that the soul-forge and the combat and the losses had produced. The young soldier's face was the face that Jagren had worn when he entered the war — eager, untested, believing that combat was performance and that glory was the measure of a warrior's worth.

"Yeah," Jagren said. "I came back."

The words were the acknowledgment. The particular, simple statement that contained the transformation's summary — the duelist who had sought glory discovering that the thing that mattered was not the glory but the coming back. The returning. The showing up. The same lesson that Korvain had taught Itzil and that the war had taught everyone who survived it.

Jagren put away his dueling blade. Not permanently — the weapon was part of his identity and the identity was not discarded but transformed. The putting away was symbolic — the gesture that communicated the shift from the combat function that the blade had served to the teaching function that the future would require.

He wouldn't carry it the same way anymore. The blade that had been drawn for performance — the weapon that the arena fighter had wielded for the applause of crowds — would be drawn for instruction. The combat capability that the war had refined would be transmitted to others — not as techniques for killing but as discipline for living.

He would teach. Discipline, not glory. The lesson that Itzil and the war had taught him — the understanding that the measure of a warrior was not the victories they accumulated but the people they protected and the wisdom they transmitted.

The young soldier watched Jagren walk away. The duelist's back — straight, strong, carrying the weight that the counting had accumulated — moving through the battlefield's aftermath toward the future that the war's conclusion had made possible.

The future was teaching. The future was discipline. The future was the transmission of the lesson that the war had taught — that glory was not the measure of a warrior and that coming back was the thing that mattered.

Jagren walked. The battlefield was behind him. The counting was finished.

The dead were acknowledged. The living were ahead.
