Chapter 12 - GRAVOK'S SUNRISE

Itzil visited Gravok because the war's end demanded that she look at every face the war had produced — even the ones she had fought.

The beast-master occupied a cell in the alliance's detention facility — not the palace dungeon where Valdremor was held but the separate, more humane containment that the prisoner's cooperation and the time served had earned. The cell was better than his previous one — a window, a bed with a mattress, the modest improvements that good behavior and useful intelligence had produced.

Gravok had been cooperative since the war ended. The intelligence that the beast-master provided — the information about Dominion holdouts, the identification of war criminals who had disguised themselves as civilians, the knowledge of hidden facilities and concealed assets — was valuable. The cooperation was not ideological — Gravok was not converting to the alliance's cause. The cooperation was practical — the beast-master's assessment that useful prisoners received better treatment than useless ones and that treatment was the variable that his incarcerated condition permitted him to influence.

He had changed. Prison and time had worn away the brutality that had been his defining quality — the aggressive, domineering personality that had commanded war-beasts and conquered cities. What remained was a tired man who missed the sky. The transformation was not dramatic — it was erosive. The particular, gradual change that confinement produced when the confined person's aggressive tendencies had nothing to exercise against and the energy that aggression required was consumed by the boredom that imprisonment imposed.

Itzil sat across from him. The commander and the beast-master — the bearer of the blade that had destroyed Vastrix and the first major villain the blade had been drawn against. The distance between them was measured in the war's entire progression — from the early confrontation where Gravok had been the greatest threat the heroes had faced to this moment where the greatest threat was a tired man in a cell with a window.

"Was it worth it?" Itzil asked. "The fighting? The beasts? The conquering?"

The question was direct — the commander's communication style applied to the inquiry that the visit's purpose demanded. The question was not rhetorical — Itzil wanted the answer. The particular, genuine curiosity that existed when a person who had spent years fighting wanted to understand what the fighting had meant to the person they had been fighting against.

"No," Gravok said.

The answer was immediate. The particular, unrehearsed honesty that existed when a person had processed a question for months in the solitude that imprisonment provided and the answer had been settled long before the question was asked.

"But I didn't know that then," he continued. "I only knew the roar of battle. It sounds like purpose."

The words contained the beast-master's self-diagnosis — the assessment of the motivation that had driven his career of conquest and violence. The roar of battle — the sound of combat, the noise that fighting produced — had sounded like purpose. The particular, dangerous confusion that existed when a person interpreted the intensity of an experience as the meaning of the experience and concluded that the intense thing was the important thing.

He paused. The particular, weighted silence that preceded the correction that the diagnosis required.

"It's not."

Two words. The beast-master's conclusion — the assessment that the roar of battle was not purpose, that the intensity of combat was not the meaning of existence, that the thing he had spent his life pursuing was not the thing that mattered.

Itzil asked what he wanted. The question that the visit's practical purpose demanded — the assessment of the prisoner's desires that the prisoner's cooperation and the war's conclusion made relevant.

"I told your diplomat," Gravok said. "I want to see the sunrise."

The same request he had made when the war ended. The same modest, particular desire — the sight of the sun rising, the daily event that imprisonment had denied him and that his consciousness had converted from ordinary experience into the thing he wanted most.

She considered. The commander's evaluation — the assessment of the request's appropriateness, the weighing of the prisoner's cooperation against the security requirements that his detention imposed. The consideration was brief. The request was modest. The cooperation was genuine. The risk was minimal.

She nodded to the guards. Open the window.

The guards complied. The window's shutters — the barriers that controlled the light and air that the cell received — were opened. The window faced east. The timing was right — the dawn was approaching, the sun's progression toward the horizon producing the pre-dawn light that preceded the sunrise's full illumination.

Gravok walked to the window. The beast-master's movement was slow — the particular, careful pace that a person produced when approaching something they had been wanting for a long time and that the anticipation of receiving made them reluctant to hurry. The window was open. The dawn light was present. The sunrise was approaching.

Dawn light flooded his face. The illumination that the rising sun produced — the warm, golden light that the natural progression from night to day generated. The light contacted the beast-master's skin — the physical sensation of warmth on a face that had been in artificial light for over a year. The contact was not dramatic. The contact was ordinary. The ordinary was extraordinary.

He stood there for ten minutes without moving. The particular, extended stillness that existed when a person was experiencing something that the experience's magnitude required the stillness to process. Ten minutes of sunlight on his face. Ten minutes of the ordinary miracle that free people experienced every morning without appreciation and that this imprisoned man was experiencing with the particular, concentrated gratitude that deprivation produced.

When he turned back, his eyes were wet. The tears that the sunrise had produced — the physical response to the emotional experience of seeing the sun after a year of not seeing it. The tears were not dramatic — they were quiet. The particular, restrained expression that a man who had commanded war-beasts and conquered cities produced when the thing that moved him was not battle but beauty.

"I forgot what it looked like," Gravok said.

The words were the confession. The particular, honest statement that a person produced when they acknowledged that the thing they had lost had been lost so thoroughly that they had forgotten it existed. The sunrise — the daily event, the ordinary miracle — had been forgotten. The forgetting was the imprisonment's cost — not the cell, not the confinement, but the loss of the experiences that freedom provided and that confinement denied.

"Don't forget again," Itzil said.

The response was not a command — it was advice. The particular, compassionate instruction that existed when a person who had the power to keep the window closed chose to keep it open and who accompanied the choice with the words that the choice's meaning required.

She left. The commander's visit concluded — the conversation's purpose achieved, the assessment completed, the request granted. Itzil walked from the cell through the detention facility's corridors toward the exit that the building's architecture provided.

The window stayed open. The particular, deliberate decision that Itzil's departure communicated — the instruction to the guards that the window's opening was not temporary. The beast-master would see the sunrise. Tomorrow and the day after and the days that followed. The window would remain open because the person who had the authority to close it had decided that seeing the sunrise was not a privilege to be earned but a right to be maintained.

The sun rose. The light filled the cell. The beast-master stood at the window and watched the sky change colors and felt the warmth that the light produced and experienced the particular, quiet transformation that beauty imposed on a person who had forgotten what beauty was.

The window stayed open. The sunrise continued.

And the woman who had given the order walked away from the detention facility into the morning light and thought about the difference between justice and cruelty and about the sunrise that she had almost not permitted and about the tears on the face of a man who had been her enemy and who had forgotten what the sun looked like.

The difference mattered. The sunrise mattered. The tears mattered.

Everything mattered. That was the lesson of the war — not that some things mattered and others didn't, but that everything mattered. Every person. Every sunrise. Every name.

Everything.
