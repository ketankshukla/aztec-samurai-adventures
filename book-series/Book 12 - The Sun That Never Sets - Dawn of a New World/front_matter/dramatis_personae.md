# Dramatis Personae

## The Heroes — After the War

- **Itzil** — Commander. Refuses a crown. Founds the new Sun-Blade Academy. Becomes a teacher — what Korvain was for her.
- **Kaelen** — Scout-general. Builds a continental intelligence network for prevention, not war. Marries Itzil. A house with a view.
- **Jagren** — Duelist turned teacher. Puts away his blade. Teaches discipline, not glory.
- **Neyla** — Healer. Opens a healing academy. Frees the last ash-oath slaves. Trains hundreds of healers.
- **Rainara** — Water-knot mystic. Purifies the continent's waters. Patrols the coastline. Finds peace.
- **Torvane** — Engineer. Rebuilds the capital's infrastructure for community, not control. Designs homes, not weapons.
- **Skyren** — Hawk rider. Establishes an aerial courier service connecting every nation. One last flight for closure.
- **Zariel** — Diplomat. Leads peace negotiations. Serves as ambassador. Builds bridges instead of alliances for war.
- **Solkren** — Armorer. Forges tools, not weapons. Hinges, plowshares, nails. A door that opens.
- **Amalura** — Lorekeeper. Establishes the Great Library. Writes the definitive history of the war. Every perspective.

## The Remembered

- **Korvain** — Grandmaster. Name carved on the memorial. "I showed up, Korvain. Every time."
- **Miyako** — Shadow-master. Flowers planted where she fell. Her city rebuilds.
- **Serenthar** — The Weeping Oracle. Name on the memorial (controversial — Itzil insisted). Closed the Gate she opened.
- **Helisar** — Ash-oath creator. Name on the memorial (the freed slaves he saved insisted). "He remembered their names."

## The Imprisoned

- **Valdremor** — The Architect. Imprisoned. Writes philosophy. Accepted his verdict without comment.
- **Gravok** — Beast-master. Released after five years. Trains beasts for agriculture. War-beasts pull plows now.

## The Future

- **The Young Warrior** — A new student at Itzil's academy. "How do you know you're ready?" "You don't. You just show up."
- **The Child** — Unknown. Finds a shard of obsidian at the edge of the world. It pulses with light older than the Gate. A new door opens.
