# Series Description — Aztec Samurai Adventures

## Amazon KDP Series Description (HTML formatted)

<b>Twelve books. One warrior. A blade of pure sunlight. The complete epic fantasy saga that fuses the warrior traditions of Mesoamerica with the disciplined philosophy of the samurai — in a world where empires are built on stolen souls and the only weapon that can stop them is the courage to show up when everything says you shouldn't.</b>

<p>When the Dominion raids her temple and steals a sacred relic, warrior Itzil is thrust into a war she never expected — armed with a blade of golden light that hasn't manifested in three hundred years and a prophecy she doesn't believe in. The Dominion is hunting seven ancient relics that can open a gate sealed for centuries. On the other side: something vast, hungry, and patient. Itzil must gather allies, find the relics first, and become the leader the world needs — even though she's not sure she's the leader anyone wants.</p>

<p>Over twelve books and three acts, she will build a team of broken, brilliant people into a family forged in fire. She will lose everything. She will rebuild from ashes. She will lead an army against the greatest evil the world has ever known. And she will discover that the most powerful weapon in existence responds not to strength, but to clarity of purpose.</p>

<p><b>ACT I — THE RISING (Books 1–4)</b></p>

<p>A reluctant warrior discovers her impossible gift. A team is forged. An empire reveals its terrifying ambitions. And a war begins that will reshape the world.</p>

<p><b>Book 1: Sunblade Rising — A Blade Forged in Light</b></p>
<p>She didn't ask to be chosen. The blade didn't ask for permission. When the Dominion raids her temple, Itzil discovers she can manifest a weapon of pure golden light — a power unseen for three centuries. With a bitter scout, a flashy duelist, a quiet engineer, and a healer with impossible abilities, she launches a desperate mission behind enemy lines. What they discover about the Dominion's plans for the ancient Great Gate will change everything.</p>

<p><b>Book 2: The Mirror Siege — Reflections of Betrayal</b></p>
<p>The alliance grows — but so does the danger. Mirror-portals are opening across the continent, and someone inside the resistance is feeding information to the enemy. As Itzil struggles to hold her team together, a siege forces her to confront the hardest truth of leadership: the people closest to you can do the most damage. Trust becomes the most dangerous weapon in the war.</p>

<p><b>Book 3: Ash Oaths — Bonds Written in Blood</b></p>
<p>After catastrophic losses, the team must recruit new allies from the most unlikely places — including a hawk rider who trusts no one and a water mystic consumed by fury. Blood oaths are sworn. Sacrifices are made. And Itzil begins to understand that building an alliance is not about finding perfect people. It's about finding broken people who refuse to stay broken.</p>

<p><b>Book 4: The Starless Crown — The Darkness Unveiled</b></p>
<p>The Dominion's Emperor reveals a weapon that can blot out the stars themselves — and the true scope of his ambition becomes terrifyingly clear. This isn't about conquest. This is about something far worse. As the first act reaches its climax, Itzil must face the devastating truth: the enemy they've been fighting is not the real enemy. Something else is pulling the strings. And it has been waiting for a very long time.</p>

<p><b>═══════════════════════════════════</b></p>

<p><b>ACT II — THE BREAKING (Books 5–8)</b></p>

<p>Everything falls. The alliance is shattered. The strongest are broken. The darkest hours reveal what every character is truly made of — and forge something the enemy never calculated.</p>

<p><b>Book 5: The Serpent's Gambit — A Spy Among Shadows</b></p>
<p>A spymaster who fights with whispers instead of swords. A web of espionage that reaches into the heart of the resistance. The Serpent's Gambit is a chess game played with lives, and every move reveals that the Dominion's intelligence network is far more sophisticated — and far more personal — than anyone imagined.</p>

<p><b>Book 6: Rain of Obsidian — Tides of Dark Magic</b></p>
<p>The base is destroyed. The alliance is scattered. Amalura is captured. Korvain is dying. The army is halved. This is the darkest book in the series — and the one that proves what these characters are made of. Because when the strongest hands Itzil has ever known are trembling on a stretcher, the only thing left is the refusal to stop.</p>

<p><b>Book 7: Feathers and Bone — Wings of Defiance</b></p>
<p>From the sky comes defiance. The hawk riders enter the war in force, bringing wings, fury, and a perspective the ground-bound resistance desperately needs. But every act of defiance has a cost, and the sacrifice demanded in this book will break your heart — and prove that courage is not the absence of fear. It's the decision that something matters more.</p>

<p><b>Book 8: The Shattered Blade — Forged Through Fire</b></p>
<p>The rescue mission. The blade that was shattered is reforged — but not in the way anyone expected. Through fire and loss and the kind of determination that transcends reason, the team pulls itself from the wreckage and discovers that what was broken can become something stronger than what existed before. The breaking ends. The reckoning begins.</p>

<p><b>═══════════════════════════════════</b></p>

<p><b>ACT III — THE RECKONING (Books 9–12)</b></p>

<p>The final war. The ultimate sacrifice. The dawn of a new world — earned through everything that was lost, broken, and rebuilt.</p>

<p><b>Book 9: The Forge of Souls — The Price of Power</b></p>
<p>The true nature of the relics is revealed — and the price of using them is higher than anyone imagined. Power always has a cost. And the forge that shapes souls does not distinguish between heroes and villains. Itzil must decide how far she is willing to go — and what she is willing to become — to save the world.</p>

<p><b>Book 10: The Mirror Queen — Realm of Shattered Glass</b></p>
<p>Beyond the mirrors lies a realm of shattered glass and fractured reality — and a queen who has been waiting for centuries. The Mirror Queen is not what anyone expected. She is not a villain. She is not an ally. She is something far more dangerous: she is right. And what she reveals about the true history of the war changes everything Itzil thought she knew.</p>

<p><b>Book 11: Crown of Stars — The Final Siege</b></p>
<p>The last battle. Every alliance, every sacrifice, every oath sworn in blood and fire — all of it converges on the Dominion capital for a siege that will determine the fate of the world. The Crown of Stars is the weapon that can end the war. But wearing it requires a sacrifice that no one is willing to name — until one person steps forward.</p>

<p><b>Book 12: The Sun That Never Sets — Dawn of a New World</b></p>
<p>The final book. The gate is open. The truth behind the entire war stands revealed. And in the last moments, when everything hangs in the balance, the answer comes not from the most powerful weapon or the most brilliant strategy — but from the most human choice imaginable. The sun rises. The blade blazes one last time. And the story of a lifetime reaches its conclusion — not with an ending, but with a beginning.</p>
