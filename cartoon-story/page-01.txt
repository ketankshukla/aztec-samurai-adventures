"Ixchel and the Stolen Sun"

PROMPT:
Create a high-quality 3D cartoon illustration in a Pixar-inspired chibi style. The scene is a title page composition. In the center, a 6-year-old girl with warm brown skin, large expressive dark brown eyes, long black hair in two braids with turquoise beads at the ends, wearing a bright white dress with colorful Aztec geometric patterns in turquoise, gold, and red along the hem and neckline, and small brown leather sandals, stands heroically on a grassy hilltop with one hand shielding her eyes as she gazes into the distance. Her proportions are chibi-style — oversized head roughly 1/3 of total body height, small rounded hands. Beside her sits a baby jaguar cub with golden-orange fur covered in dark brown rosette spots, oversized bright green eyes, a small pink nose, and chubby rounded paws, looking up at her adoringly. Behind them, a massive golden sun radiates warm light, casting long golden rays across the scene. A faint silhouette of an ancient stepped pyramid is visible in the soft-focus background. Tiny golden sparkles float in the air. The lighting is warm and cinematic with golden rim lighting on both characters. At the top of the image, text in a large, bold, playful rounded children's book font reads "Ixchel and the Stolen Sun" in rich gold color with a subtle dark brown outline. At the bottom, smaller text in the same font reads "Written by Ketan Shukla" in dark brown. Transparent background behind the main scene elements. Ultra-high detail, clean edges, smooth glossy textures. No watermarks. Square format, 1024x1024.
