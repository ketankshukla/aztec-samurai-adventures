PROMPT:
Create a high-quality 3D cartoon illustration in a Pixar-inspired chibi style. The scene shows a small, colorful Mesoamerican village with three or four rounded adobe houses with thatched roofs, painted in warm terracotta, soft yellow, and dusty rose. In the foreground, a 6-year-old girl with warm brown skin, large expressive dark brown eyes, long black hair in two braids with turquoise beads at the ends, wearing a bright white dress with colorful Aztec geometric patterns in turquoise, gold, and red along the hem and neckline, and small brown leather sandals, stands smiling with her hands clasped behind her back, looking directly at the viewer with a warm, inviting expression. Her proportions are chibi-style — oversized head roughly 1/3 of total body height. Behind her, villagers (shown as soft-focus chibi figures) tend to gardens and carry baskets. Lush green jungle trees frame the edges. Mountains with snow-capped peaks rise in the far background under a bright blue sky with fluffy white clouds. Warm morning sunlight bathes everything in golden tones. Text overlay at the bottom of the image in a warm cream-colored rounded rectangle banner reads: "In a tiny village between the jungle and the mountains, there lived a girl named Ixchel." in a playful, rounded children's book font, dark brown color. Ultra-high detail, clean edges, smooth glossy textures. No watermarks. Square format, 1024x1024.
