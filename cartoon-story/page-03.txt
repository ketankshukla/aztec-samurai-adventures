PROMPT:
Create a high-quality 3D cartoon illustration in a Pixar-inspired chibi style. The scene shows a small but beautiful stepped Aztec pyramid in the center of the village, approximately three stories tall, made of smooth carved stone with Aztec geometric patterns etched into each level. At the very top of the pyramid sits a brilliant, radiant golden crystal — roughly the size of a basketball — glowing with intense warm golden light. Rays of golden light stream outward from the crystal in all directions like a miniature sun, casting warm light across the entire village. The crystal has a faceted, gem-like shape with inner light that pulses warmly. Small golden sparkles and light particles drift upward from it. At the base of the pyramid, Ixchel — a 6-year-old girl with warm brown skin, large expressive dark brown eyes, long black hair in two braids with turquoise beads, wearing a white dress with colorful Aztec patterns — stands looking up at the crystal with wonder, her face bathed in golden light. Several chibi villagers nearby also look up, smiling. Morning sky behind is soft peach and gold. Text overlay at the bottom in a warm cream-colored rounded rectangle banner reads: "Every morning, a magical sun crystal glowed bright gold, filling the village with warmth and light." in a playful, rounded children's book font, dark brown color. Ultra-high detail, clean edges, smooth glossy textures. No watermarks. Square format, 1024x1024.
