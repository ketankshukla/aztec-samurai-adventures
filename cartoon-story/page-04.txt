PROMPT:
Create a high-quality 3D cartoon illustration in a Pixar-inspired chibi style. The scene shows Ixchel — a 6-year-old girl with warm brown skin, large expressive dark brown eyes wide with shock, long black hair in two braids with turquoise beads, wearing a white dress with colorful Aztec patterns and brown sandals — standing at the top of the small village pyramid, her hands pressed against her cheeks in a classic surprised gasp expression, mouth open in an "O" shape. She is staring at an empty stone pedestal where the crystal used to sit. The pedestal has a circular indent in the top, clearly showing something is missing. A few fading golden sparkles linger where the crystal once was. The entire scene is cast in cool grey-blue tones — no warm light, no golden glow. The sky is overcast and heavy with dark grey clouds. The village below looks dim and muted. The contrast between the usually warm village and this cold, grey version is stark. Ixchel's expression conveys alarm and determination. Text overlay at the bottom in a warm cream-colored rounded rectangle banner reads: "But one morning, everything was grey. She ran to the pyramid. The sun crystal was gone!" in a playful, rounded children's book font, dark brown color. Ultra-high detail, clean edges, smooth glossy textures. No watermarks. Square format, 1024x1024.
