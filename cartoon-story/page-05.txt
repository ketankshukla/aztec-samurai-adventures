PAGE 5 — THE VILLAGE GROWS DARK

STORY TEXT:
"Without the crystal, the flowers closed, the birds stopped singing, and the village grew colder and darker with every hour."

PROMPT:
Create a high-quality 3D cartoon illustration in a Pixar-inspired chibi style. The scene shows the village in a state of grey sadness. Flowers that were once bright are now closed and drooping, rendered in muted, desaturated colors. Three or four chibi villagers stand around looking worried — an elderly woman with a shawl wrapped tight, a man rubbing his arms from the cold, a small boy hugging his mother's leg. The trees at the jungle edge have lost their vibrant green and appear dull olive. No birds are visible in the sky. A thin mist creeps along the ground. The houses look dim without the golden light reflecting off them. In the center, Ixchel — a 6-year-old girl with warm brown skin, large expressive dark brown eyes showing deep concern, long black hair in two braids with turquoise beads, white dress with Aztec patterns — stands with her fists clenched at her sides, jaw set with determination, looking toward the jungle. She is the only character who looks determined rather than sad. The overall palette is cool blue-grey with no warm tones. Text overlay at the bottom in a warm cream-colored rounded rectangle banner reads: "The flowers closed, the birds stopped singing, and the village grew colder with every hour." in a playful, rounded children's book font, dark brown color. Ultra-high detail, clean edges, smooth glossy textures. No watermarks. Square format, 1024x1024.
