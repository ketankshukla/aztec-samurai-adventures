PAGE 6 — TINY FOOTPRINTS

STORY TEXT:
"Ixchel knelt by the pyramid and found tiny, smudgy footprints — like little hands with long fingers. Something small had taken the crystal."

PROMPT:
Create a high-quality 3D cartoon illustration in a Pixar-inspired chibi style. The scene is a close-up view at the base of the pyramid. Ixchel — a 6-year-old girl with warm brown skin, large expressive dark brown eyes squinting with focus and curiosity, long black hair in two braids with turquoise beads, white dress with Aztec patterns — is kneeling on the ground, one hand touching the dirt, the other pointing at a trail of small, smudgy, hand-like footprints in the dusty earth. The footprints are clearly from a small monkey — four tiny fingers and a thumb visible in each print, with a faint purple-grey shimmer to them. The trail of prints leads away from the pyramid base and toward the jungle tree line in the background. A few fading golden sparkle particles are mixed in with the footprints, as if the crystal dripped light as it was carried away. Ixchel's face shows a detective-like concentration — one eyebrow raised, lips pressed together thoughtfully. The ground is rendered in detailed sandy-brown earth texture. The scene remains in cool grey-blue tones. Text overlay at the bottom in a warm cream-colored rounded rectangle banner reads: "She found tiny, smudgy footprints — like little hands with long fingers. Something small had taken the crystal." in a playful, rounded children's book font, dark brown color. Ultra-high detail, clean edges, smooth glossy textures. No watermarks. Square format, 1024x1024.
