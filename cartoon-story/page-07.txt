PROMPT:
Create a high-quality 3D cartoon illustration in a Pixar-inspired chibi style. The scene shows Ixchel — a 6-year-old girl with warm brown skin, large expressive dark brown eyes, long black hair in two braids with turquoise beads, white dress with Aztec patterns, brown sandals — standing at the edge of the jungle, hands on her hips, looking down with an amused, lopsided smile. At her feet, a baby jaguar cub has just tumbled out of a bush and landed on his back in a comical sprawl. The cub has golden-orange fur covered in dark brown rosette spots, oversized bright green eyes looking up at her with a goofy upside-down grin, a small pink nose, chubby rounded paws sticking up in the air, and a short playful tail. Green leaves and small twigs are stuck in his fur from tumbling through the bush. The bush behind him is still rustling, with leaves settling. The jungle edge is visible — thick green foliage, hanging vines, colorful tropical flowers. Despite the grey sky, this moment has a spark of warmth between the two characters. Text overlay at the bottom in a warm cream-colored rounded rectangle banner reads: "A baby jaguar tumbled out of the bushes and landed right at her feet. 'I guess you're coming with me.'" in a playful, rounded children's book font, dark brown color. Ultra-high detail, clean edges, smooth glossy textures. No watermarks. Square format, 1024x1024.
