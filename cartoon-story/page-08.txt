PROMPT:
Create a high-quality 3D cartoon illustration in a Pixar-inspired chibi style. The scene shows Ixchel — a 6-year-old girl with warm brown skin, large expressive dark brown eyes looking upward in awe, long black hair in two braids with turquoise beads, white dress with Aztec patterns, brown sandals — walking along a winding jungle path. Beside her trots the baby jaguar Sol — golden-orange fur with dark brown rosette spots, oversized bright green eyes, small pink nose, chubby paws — looking around curiously. They are dwarfed by enormous jungle trees with thick, gnarled trunks covered in moss and vines. The canopy above is so dense it almost blocks the sky, with shafts of dim grey-blue light filtering through gaps in the leaves. Massive tropical leaves — bigger than Ixchel — hang from branches. On the ground, the tiny monkey footprints are faintly visible on the path with occasional golden sparkle traces. Colorful but muted jungle flowers dot the undergrowth. A blue morpho butterfly flutters near Ixchel's head. The atmosphere is mysterious but not scary — more wonder than danger. Text overlay at the bottom in a warm cream-colored rounded rectangle banner reads: "Together, Ixchel and Sol followed the footprints into the jungle. The trees were so tall they touched the clouds." in a playful, rounded children's book font, dark brown color. Ultra-high detail, clean edges, smooth glossy textures. No watermarks.
