"They came to a wide river with big round stones poking out of the water. 'We can hop across!' said Ixchel. Sol was not so sure."

PROMPT:
Create a high-quality 3D cartoon illustration in a Pixar-inspired chibi style. The scene shows a wide, gently flowing jungle river with smooth, large, round stones arranged like stepping stones across the water. The water is rendered in beautiful clear turquoise-blue with soft white ripples around each stone. Ixchel — a 6-year-old girl with warm brown skin, large expressive dark brown eyes bright with excitement, long black hair in two braids with turquoise beads, white dress with Aztec patterns, brown sandals — stands confidently on the first stone with one foot forward, pointing across the river with a big adventurous smile. On the riverbank behind her, Sol the baby jaguar — golden-orange fur with dark brown rosette spots, oversized bright green eyes — sits with his ears flattened back, one paw tentatively reaching toward the first stone, his expression showing comical nervousness, tail curled tight against his body. The far bank shows the continuation of the jungle path. Lush ferns and tropical plants line both banks. Small colorful fish are visible in the clear water. A few dragonflies hover above the surface. Text overlay at the bottom in a warm cream-colored rounded rectangle banner reads: "'We can hop across!' said Ixchel. Sol was not so sure." in a playful, rounded children's book font, dark brown color. Ultra-high detail, clean edges, smooth glossy textures. No watermarks. Square format, 1024x1024.
