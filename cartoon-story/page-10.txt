PROMPT:
Create a high-quality 3D cartoon illustration in a Pixar-inspired chibi style. A split-action scene showing two moments. On the right side, Ixchel — a 6-year-old girl with warm brown skin, large expressive dark brown eyes crinkled with laughter, long black hair in two braids with turquoise beads, white dress with Aztec patterns — stands on the far riverbank, bending down with both arms stretched out, laughing joyfully. On the left-center, Sol the baby jaguar is mid-splash in the river — only his head and front paws are above water, his golden-orange fur completely soaked and plastered flat, his oversized bright green eyes are huge and round with surprise, mouth open in a startled expression. A dramatic splash of water droplets radiates outward from where he fell in, individual water drops caught in mid-air, sparkling. His ears are flat and dripping. Ixchel is grabbing his front paws to pull him out. The stepping stones are visible around them. The scene is comedic and full of energy and movement. Water droplets everywhere. Text overlay at the bottom in a warm cream-colored rounded rectangle banner reads: "SPLASH! Sol fell right into the water. Ixchel laughed and pulled him out." in a playful, rounded children's book font, dark brown color. Ultra-high detail, clean edges, smooth glossy textures. No watermarks. Square format, 1024x1024.
