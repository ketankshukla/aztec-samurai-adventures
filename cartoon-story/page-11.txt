"On the other side, a bright-beaked toucan swooped down and landed on a branch. 'Hello! I'm Coco! Are you looking for the little monkey who ran past here?'"

PROMPT:
Create a high-quality 3D cartoon illustration in a Pixar-inspired chibi style. The scene shows Ixchel — a 6-year-old girl with warm brown skin, large expressive dark brown eyes looking up with surprise and delight, long black hair in two braids with turquoise beads, white dress with Aztec patterns, brown sandals — and Sol the baby jaguar — golden-orange fur still slightly damp from the river, oversized bright green eyes looking up curiously — both gazing upward at a branch above them. On the branch perches Coco, a small cartoonishly round toucan with glossy black feathers, a vibrant rainbow-gradient beak (red fading to orange, yellow, and green at the tip), bright round orange eyes, and tiny orange feet gripping the branch. Coco has one wing raised in a cheerful wave, head tilted to one side with a friendly, chatty expression. The branch is part of a large tropical tree with broad green leaves. A few colorful parrots are visible in the background foliage. Soft jungle lighting filters through the canopy. Text overlay at the bottom in a warm cream-colored rounded rectangle banner reads: "'Hello! I'm Coco! Are you looking for the little monkey who ran past here?'" in a playful, rounded children's book font, dark brown color. Ultra-high detail, clean edges, smooth glossy textures. No watermarks. Square format, 1024x1024.
