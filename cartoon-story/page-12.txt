PROMPT:
Create a high-quality 3D cartoon illustration in a Pixar-inspired chibi style. The scene shows Coco the toucan — glossy black feathers, vibrant rainbow-gradient beak, bright round orange eyes — perched on a low branch at eye level with Ixchel, one wing extended and pointing dramatically toward a large mountain visible in the background. The mountain rises above the jungle canopy, its peak shrouded in grey mist, with a winding path barely visible along its side. Ixchel — a 6-year-old girl with warm brown skin, large expressive dark brown eyes showing thoughtful concern, long black hair in two braids with turquoise beads, white dress with Aztec patterns — stands looking at the mountain with one hand on her chin in a thinking pose. Sol the baby jaguar — golden-orange fur with rosette spots, oversized bright green eyes — sits beside her, also looking at the mountain, ears perked forward attentively. A thought bubble above Ixchel shows a small silhouette of a monkey hugging a glowing golden orb with a sad expression. The jungle stretches between them and the mountain. Text overlay at the bottom in a warm cream-colored rounded rectangle banner reads: "'He went up the mountain,' said Coco. 'He was hugging something golden. He looked very sad.'" in a playful, rounded children's book font, dark brown color. Ultra-high detail, clean edges, smooth glossy textures. No watermarks. Square format, 1024x1024.
