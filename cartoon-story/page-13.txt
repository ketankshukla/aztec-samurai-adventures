PROMPT:
Create a high-quality 3D cartoon illustration in a Pixar-inspired chibi style. The scene shows a steep, winding mountain path carved into the side of a tall jungle mountain. Ixchel — a 6-year-old girl with warm brown skin, large expressive dark brown eyes showing determination, long black hair in two braids with turquoise beads, white dress with Aztec patterns, brown sandals — is climbing the rocky path with one hand gripping a rock above her and one foot stepping up to the next level, her expression focused and resolute. Sol the baby jaguar — golden-orange fur with dark brown rosette spots, oversized bright green eyes — climbs beside her with more natural agility, his claws gripping the rocks easily, looking back at Ixchel encouragingly. The path is made of rough grey-brown stone with small tufts of grass growing between cracks. Below them, the jungle canopy stretches out like a vast green carpet. In the far background, far below, the tiny village is barely visible as a cluster of miniature buildings. The sky above is grey and overcast. Tiny monkey footprints with golden sparkle traces continue up the path ahead of them. Text overlay at the bottom in a warm cream-colored rounded rectangle banner reads: "The path was steep and rocky, but Ixchel didn't stop." in a playful, rounded children's book font, dark brown color. Ultra-high detail, clean edges, smooth glossy textures. No watermarks. Square format, 1024x1024.
