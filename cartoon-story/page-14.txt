PAGE 14 — THE HIDDEN WATERFALL

STORY TEXT:
"Halfway up, they found a beautiful waterfall pouring down from the rocks above. The water sparkled even without the sun. 'The footprints go behind it,' said Ixchel."

PROMPT:
Create a high-quality 3D cartoon illustration in a Pixar-inspired chibi style. The scene shows a stunning waterfall cascading down a mossy rock face on the mountainside. The water is crystal clear and rendered with beautiful detail — individual droplets, white foam at the base, and a fine mist rising from where it hits the rocks below. Despite the grey sky, the water has an inner luminosity, catching and refracting what little light exists into subtle rainbow prisms in the mist. Ixchel — a 6-year-old girl with warm brown skin, large expressive dark brown eyes wide with wonder, long black hair in two braids with turquoise beads, white dress with Aztec patterns now slightly dusty from climbing — stands at the base of the waterfall, pointing at the edge where the water meets the rock. Behind the curtain of water, the dark outline of a cave entrance is faintly visible. Sol the baby jaguar — golden-orange fur with rosette spots, oversized bright green eyes — is sniffing at the ground where the monkey footprints lead directly toward the waterfall and disappear behind it. The footprints have faint golden sparkle traces. Ferns and moss cover the rocks around the waterfall. Text overlay at the bottom in a warm cream-colored rounded rectangle banner reads: "'The footprints go behind it,' said Ixchel." in a playful, rounded children's book font, dark brown color. Ultra-high detail, clean edges, smooth glossy textures. No watermarks. Square format, 1024x1024.
