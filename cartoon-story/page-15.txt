STORY TEXT:
"They squeezed behind the waterfall and found a secret cave! Inside, it was dark and cool, and water dripped from the ceiling like tiny diamonds."

PROMPT:
Create a high-quality 3D cartoon illustration in a Pixar-inspired chibi style. The scene shows the interior of a cave entrance, viewed from inside looking partially back toward the waterfall. The waterfall creates a shimmering curtain of water across the cave mouth, letting in soft diffused blue-white light. Ixchel — a 6-year-old girl with warm brown skin, large expressive dark brown eyes looking around in fascination, long black hair in two braids with turquoise beads, white dress with Aztec patterns — stands just inside the cave, her hair and the edges of her dress slightly damp from passing through the waterfall. She has one hand extended, catching water droplets falling from the ceiling. Sol the baby jaguar — golden-orange fur with rosette spots, oversized bright green eyes reflecting the waterfall's light — stands beside her, shaking water off one paw with a comical annoyed expression. The cave walls are smooth dark grey stone, glistening with moisture. Water droplets fall from stalactites above, each droplet rendered as a tiny crystalline diamond shape catching the light. The cave extends deeper into darkness behind them. Faint golden sparkle traces on the cave floor lead deeper inside. Text overlay at the bottom in a warm cream-colored rounded rectangle banner reads: "They found a secret cave! Water dripped from the ceiling like tiny diamonds." in a playful, rounded children's book font, dark brown color. Ultra-high detail, clean edges, smooth glossy textures. No watermarks.
