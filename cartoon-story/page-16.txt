PROMPT:
Create a high-quality 3D cartoon illustration in a Pixar-inspired chibi style. The scene shows a magical underground cave passage filled with bioluminescent mushrooms. The mushrooms grow from the walls, floor, and ceiling in clusters — some tiny, some as large as Ixchel's head. They glow in beautiful soft colors: cool blue, deep purple, vivid green, and soft teal, each mushroom casting its own gentle colored light that blends together creating a dreamlike rainbow effect on the cave walls. Ixchel — a 6-year-old girl with warm brown skin, large expressive dark brown eyes reflecting the colorful glow, long black hair in two braids with turquoise beads, white dress with Aztec patterns now illuminated in shifting colors — walks through the passage with an expression of pure enchantment, one hand gently reaching out to touch a large blue mushroom. Sol the baby jaguar — golden-orange fur with rosette spots, oversized bright green eyes — walks beside her, his fur tinted by the colorful lights, nose twitching as he sniffs a small purple mushroom cluster. The cave passage curves gently ahead. Golden sparkle footprints are visible on the cave floor between the mushroom patches, leading forward. Tiny luminescent spores drift in the air like gentle fireflies. Text overlay at the bottom in a warm cream-colored rounded rectangle banner reads: "Glowing mushrooms lit the way — blue and purple and green, like a garden of tiny lanterns." in a playful, rounded children's book font, dark brown color. Ultra-high detail, clean edges, smooth glossy textures. No watermarks. Square format, 1024x1024.
