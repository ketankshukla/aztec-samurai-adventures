PAGE 17 — THE UNDERGROUND BRIDGE

STORY TEXT:
"They came to a deep underground canyon with a narrow stone bridge across it. 'Don't look down,' whispered Ixchel. Sol looked down."

PROMPT:
Create a high-quality 3D cartoon illustration in a Pixar-inspired chibi style. The scene shows a dramatic underground cavern with a narrow natural stone bridge spanning a deep dark chasm. The bridge is rough-hewn stone, barely wide enough for Ixchel to walk across, with no railings. The chasm below disappears into deep blue-black darkness with faint glowing mushroom light from far below giving a sense of enormous depth. Ixchel — a 6-year-old girl with warm brown skin, large expressive dark brown eyes focused straight ahead with brave determination, long black hair in two braids with turquoise beads, white dress with Aztec patterns — is halfway across the bridge, arms slightly out for balance, taking careful deliberate steps. She is pointedly NOT looking down. Behind her on the bridge, Sol the baby jaguar — golden-orange fur with rosette spots, oversized bright green eyes — is frozen mid-step, head tilted directly downward, staring into the chasm with enormous round eyes and flattened ears, his expression one of pure cartoon terror. His tail is puffed up to twice its normal size. The contrast between Ixchel's bravery and Sol's panic is comedic. Stalactites hang from the cavern ceiling above. Faint bioluminescent glow from scattered mushrooms provides dim lighting. Text overlay at the bottom in a warm cream-colored rounded rectangle banner reads: "'Don't look down,' whispered Ixchel. Sol looked down." in a playful, rounded children's book font, dark brown color. Ultra-high detail, clean edges, smooth glossy textures. No watermarks. Square format, 1024x1024.
