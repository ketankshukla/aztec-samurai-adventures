STORY TEXT:
"They made it across and climbed through a crack in the rock. Sunshine! Well, grey-shine. But after the dark cave, it felt wonderful."

PROMPT:
Create a high-quality 3D cartoon illustration in a Pixar-inspired chibi style. The scene shows Ixchel and Sol emerging from a narrow crack in a rock face on the other side of the mountain. Ixchel — a 6-year-old girl with warm brown skin, large expressive dark brown eyes squinting and smiling as she adjusts to the light, long black hair in two braids with turquoise beads, white dress with Aztec patterns slightly dusty and damp from the cave — steps out with her arms spread wide, face tilted up to the sky in relief and joy, taking a deep breath. Sol the baby jaguar — golden-orange fur with rosette spots, oversized bright green eyes — bounds out of the crack behind her, leaping joyfully with all four paws off the ground in a happy bounce. They are now on the mountain's upper slope. The landscape before them is a high alpine meadow with short green-grey grass and scattered wildflowers. The sky is still overcast grey, but noticeably brighter than in the cave. In the distance, higher up the mountain, ancient stone ruins are visible — crumbling walls and a small pyramid structure half-covered in moss and vines. The monkey footprints with golden sparkles lead directly toward the ruins. Text overlay at the bottom in a warm cream-colored rounded rectangle banner reads: "Sunshine! Well, grey-shine. But after the dark cave, it felt wonderful." in a playful, rounded children's book font, dark brown color. Ultra-high detail, clean edges, smooth glossy textures. No watermarks. Square format, 1024x1024.
