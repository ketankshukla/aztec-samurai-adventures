PROMPT:
Create a high-quality 3D cartoon illustration in a Pixar-inspired chibi style. The scene shows the mountain meadow being overtaken by a sudden storm. Dark, dramatic storm clouds roll across the sky in swirling grey-purple masses. Lightning flashes in the distance — a bright zigzag bolt illuminating the clouds from within. Rain falls in large, visible, cartoon-style drops — big round glistening droplets. Ixchel — a 6-year-old girl with warm brown skin, large expressive dark brown eyes wide with urgency, long black hair in two braids with turquoise beads whipping in the wind, white dress with Aztec patterns getting wet with rain spots — runs across the meadow with one hand holding her braids and the other pulling Sol along. Sol the baby jaguar — golden-orange fur with rosette spots getting soaked, oversized bright green eyes squinted against the rain, ears flat — gallops beside her, his fur slicked down by the rain. The grass bends dramatically in the wind. Ahead of them, a massive tropical flower with enormous petals — bright red and orange, the size of a small tent — is visible among some rocks, offering potential shelter. The overall atmosphere is dramatic but not scary — more exciting adventure than danger. Text overlay at the bottom in a warm cream-colored rounded rectangle banner reads: "Thunder rumbled like a giant's tummy. 'We need to find shelter!' said Ixchel." in a playful, rounded children's book font, dark brown color. Ultra-high detail, clean edges, smooth glossy textures. No watermarks. Square format, 1024x1024.
