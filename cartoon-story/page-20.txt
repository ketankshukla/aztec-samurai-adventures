PAGE 20 — SHELTER UNDER THE GIANT FLOWER

STORY TEXT:
"They hid under a flower as big as a house. The petals kept them dry while the rain danced on the leaves above. Sol curled up in Ixchel's lap and purred."

PROMPT:
Create a high-quality 3D cartoon illustration in a Pixar-inspired chibi style. The scene shows the interior of a giant tropical flower being used as a cozy shelter. The flower's enormous red-orange petals curve overhead like a natural tent, their undersides a softer pink-gold color. Rain patters on the outer surface of the petals, visible as gentle dimples and rivulets running along the petal edges, but the inside is completely dry. Ixchel — a 6-year-old girl with warm brown skin, large expressive dark brown eyes looking peaceful and content, long black hair in two braids with turquoise beads, white dress with Aztec patterns — sits cross-legged on the soft center of the flower, which has a cushion-like golden pollen pad. Sol the baby jaguar — golden-orange fur with rosette spots, oversized bright green eyes closed in peaceful contentment — is curled up in her lap, purring visibly (small "zzz" or musical note symbols near his head). Ixchel gently strokes his fur with one hand. Through the gaps between petals, the rain is visible outside — streaks of silver water against the grey sky. The atmosphere inside the flower is warm, cozy, and golden — a pocket of warmth in the storm. Small dewdrops on the inner petal surfaces catch the light. Text overlay at the bottom in a warm cream-colored rounded rectangle banner reads: "The petals kept them dry while the rain danced above. Sol curled up in Ixchel's lap and purred." in a playful, rounded children's book font, dark brown color. Ultra-high detail, clean edges, smooth glossy textures. No watermarks.
