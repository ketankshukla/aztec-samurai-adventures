PROMPT:
Create a high-quality 3D cartoon illustration in a Pixar-inspired chibi style. The scene shows a breathtaking post-storm landscape. Ixchel — a 6-year-old girl with warm brown skin, large expressive dark brown eyes shining with awe, long black hair in two braids with turquoise beads, white dress with Aztec patterns — stands outside the giant flower shelter with her hand shielding her eyes, looking up at the sky in wonder. Sol the baby jaguar — golden-orange fur with rosette spots, oversized bright green eyes reflecting rainbow colors — stands beside her, also gazing upward with his mouth open in awe. Above them, a magnificent, vivid rainbow arcs across the clearing sky — rendered in bold, saturated bands of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. The rainbow's arc leads the eye directly to the ancient ruins at the mountain's summit — a crumbling stepped pyramid with moss and vines, now clearly visible in the distance. The storm clouds are parting to reveal patches of silver-blue sky. Everything glistens with fresh rain — water droplets on grass blades, puddles reflecting the rainbow. The landscape sparkles. The ruins at the end of the rainbow feel like a destination — a magical endpoint. Text overlay at the bottom in a warm cream-colored rounded rectangle banner reads: "A rainbow stretched across the sky — and it pointed straight to the ancient ruins." in a playful, rounded children's book font, dark brown color. Ultra-high detail, clean edges, smooth glossy textures. No watermarks. Square format, 1024x1024.
