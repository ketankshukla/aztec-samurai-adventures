PROMPT:
Create a high-quality 3D cartoon illustration in a Pixar-inspired chibi style. The scene shows Ixchel and Sol standing at the base of an ancient, overgrown Aztec pyramid, viewed from a low angle looking upward to emphasize its imposing height. The pyramid is made of weathered grey-green stone, covered in intricate carved reliefs depicting suns with radiating rays, crescent moons, jaguars in profile, serpents, and geometric Aztec patterns. Moss, vines, and small ferns grow in the cracks between stones. The pyramid has steep steps running up the center face. At the very top — small from this perspective — a faint golden glow pulses from within a small temple structure, casting warm light that contrasts with the grey surroundings. Ixchel — a 6-year-old girl with warm brown skin, large expressive dark brown eyes looking upward with determination and wonder, long black hair in two braids with turquoise beads, white dress with Aztec patterns — stands at the bottom step, one foot already on the first stair, fists clenched with resolve. Sol the baby jaguar — golden-orange fur with rosette spots, oversized bright green eyes — sits beside her, tail swishing with anticipation, also looking up. The pyramid is framed by ancient trees on either side. Text overlay at the bottom in a warm cream-colored rounded rectangle banner reads: "At the very top, a faint golden glow flickered." in a playful, rounded children's book font, dark brown color. Ultra-high detail, clean edges, smooth glossy textures. No watermarks. Square format, 1024x1024.
