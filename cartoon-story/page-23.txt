STORY TEXT:
"At the top, they found him — a tiny monkey with dark purple fur, hugging the sun crystal tight. He wasn't scary at all. He was shaking."

PROMPT:
Create a high-quality 3D cartoon illustration in a Pixar-inspired chibi style. The scene is at the top of the ancient pyramid, inside the small open-air temple structure. In the center, sitting on a stone altar, is Sombra the shadow monkey — a small spider monkey with dark grey-purple fur that shimmers slightly, big sad violet eyes glistening with tears, long lashes, a long curly tail wrapped around himself protectively, and tiny delicate hands clutching the sun crystal tightly against his chest. The sun crystal glows warm gold, illuminating his face and chest from below, creating a warm circle of golden light around him in contrast to the cold grey everywhere else. The monkey is visibly trembling — his fur slightly ruffled, his body hunched small, his expression one of fear and loneliness rather than defiance. He looks up at Ixchel and Sol with wide, scared eyes. Ixchel — a 6-year-old girl with warm brown skin, large expressive dark brown eyes softening from determination to compassion, long black hair in two braids with turquoise beads, white dress with Aztec patterns — stands at the temple entrance, one hand on the doorframe. Her expression is changing from "I found the thief" to "oh, he's just scared." Sol the baby jaguar peeks from behind her leg, curious. Text overlay at the bottom in a warm cream-colored rounded rectangle banner reads: "He wasn't scary at all. He was shaking." in a playful, rounded children's book font, dark brown color. Ultra-high detail, clean edges, smooth glossy textures. No watermarks. Square format, 1024x1024.
