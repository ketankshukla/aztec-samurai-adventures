PAGE 24 — IXCHEL SITS DOWN

STORY TEXT:
"Ixchel didn't yell. She didn't grab the crystal. She sat down on the cold stone floor, right next to the little monkey. 'Hi,' she said softly. 'I'm Ixchel.'"

PROMPT:
Create a high-quality 3D cartoon illustration in a Pixar-inspired chibi style. The scene is inside the pyramid temple at the summit. Ixchel — a 6-year-old girl with warm brown skin, large expressive dark brown eyes full of warmth and gentle kindness, long black hair in two braids with turquoise beads, white dress with Aztec patterns — has sat down cross-legged on the cold stone floor of the temple, putting herself at the same level as the monkey. Her posture is open and non-threatening — hands resting on her knees, body relaxed, head tilted slightly with a soft, gentle smile. Beside her, Sombra the shadow monkey — dark grey-purple fur, big sad violet eyes, long curly tail — is still hugging the golden sun crystal against his chest, but his trembling has reduced slightly. He peeks at Ixchel with one eye, cautious but curious. The golden glow of the crystal illuminates both of them in warm light, creating an intimate circle of warmth on the cold stone floor. Sol the baby jaguar has lain down behind Ixchel, resting his chin on his paws, watching quietly with gentle green eyes — giving the monkey space. The temple columns frame the scene. The atmosphere has shifted from tension to tenderness. Text overlay at the bottom in a warm cream-colored rounded rectangle banner reads: "She sat down right next to the little monkey. 'Hi,' she said softly. 'I'm Ixchel.'" in a playful, rounded children's book font, dark brown color. Ultra-high detail, clean edges, smooth glossy textures. No watermarks. Square format, 1024x1024.
