STORY TEXT:
"The monkey's name was Sombra. He lived alone in the dark ruins. He took the crystal because he was tired of being cold and lonely. He just wanted a little light."

PROMPT:
Create a high-quality 3D cartoon illustration in a Pixar-inspired chibi style. The scene is inside the pyramid temple. Sombra the shadow monkey — dark grey-purple shimmering fur, big sad violet eyes now brimming with tears that catch the golden light, long lashes, long curly tail — sits facing Ixchel, still holding the sun crystal but now resting it in his lap rather than clutching it defensively. His tiny hands gesture as he communicates his story. Above him, a thought bubble shows his memories: a small, dark, cold version of the ruins with Sombra sitting alone in the corner, shivering, surrounded by darkness — conveying his loneliness. In the present scene, Ixchel — warm brown skin, large expressive dark brown eyes now glistening with empathetic tears, long black hair in two braids with turquoise beads, white dress with Aztec patterns — listens intently, one hand over her heart, her expression full of compassion and understanding. Sol the baby jaguar has inched closer and is now sitting between them, looking from one to the other with concerned green eyes, his head tilting. The golden light from the crystal bathes all three of them in warmth. The emotional tone is tender and poignant. Text overlay at the bottom in a warm cream-colored rounded rectangle banner reads: "He took the crystal because he was tired of being cold and lonely. He just wanted a little light." in a playful, rounded children's book font, dark brown color. Ultra-high detail, clean edges, smooth glossy textures. No watermarks. Square format, 1024x1024.
