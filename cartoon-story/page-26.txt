"'You don't have to steal the light,' said Ixchel. 'You can share it. Come home with us! You'll never be lonely again.'"

PROMPT:
Create a high-quality 3D cartoon illustration in a Pixar-inspired chibi style. The scene shows a pivotal emotional moment inside the pyramid temple. Ixchel — a 6-year-old girl with warm brown skin, large expressive dark brown eyes bright with excitement and warmth, long black hair in two braids with turquoise beads, white dress with Aztec patterns — is on her knees, leaning forward with both hands extended toward Sombra, palms up, in a gesture of open invitation. Her face beams with a big, sincere, heartfelt smile. Sombra the shadow monkey — dark grey-purple fur, big violet eyes now wide with disbelief and fragile hope, long curly tail uncurling slightly — looks at her outstretched hands with an expression of stunned wonder, as if no one has ever offered him kindness before. One of his tiny hands tentatively reaches toward hers. The sun crystal sits between them on the stone floor, its golden glow creating a warm bridge of light connecting the two characters. Sol the baby jaguar — golden-orange fur with rosette spots, bright green eyes — nuzzles Sombra's side encouragingly with his nose. The atmosphere is one of breakthrough warmth — the emotional climax of the story. Text overlay at the bottom in a warm cream-colored rounded rectangle banner reads: "'You can share it. Come home with us! You'll never be lonely again.'" in a playful, rounded children's book font, dark brown color. Ultra-high detail, clean edges, smooth glossy textures. No watermarks. Square format, 1024x1024.
