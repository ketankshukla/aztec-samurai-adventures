PAGE 27 — SOMBRA SAYS YES

STORY TEXT:
"Sombra looked at the crystal, then at Ixchel, then at Sol. Slowly, a tiny smile crept across his face — the first smile he'd smiled in a very long time."

PROMPT:
Create a high-quality 3D cartoon illustration in a Pixar-inspired chibi style. Close-up emotional scene inside the pyramid temple. The focus is on Sombra the shadow monkey — dark grey-purple shimmering fur, big violet eyes now sparkling with happy tears (one tear rolling down his cheek catching the golden light), long lashes — his face transforming from sadness to joy. His mouth curves into a small, tentative, beautiful smile — not a big grin, but a gentle, genuine, hopeful smile that clearly hasn't been used in a long time. His tiny hand now rests in Ixchel's outstretched palm. Ixchel's hand — warm brown skin, small and gentle — holds his tiny monkey hand carefully. In the background, slightly soft-focus, Ixchel's face shows a warm, encouraging smile, and Sol the baby jaguar's face shows pure happiness with bright green eyes and a wide grin. The sun crystal on the ground between them glows brighter than before, as if responding to the emotional moment — its golden light intensifying and warming the entire scene. Golden sparkles drift upward from the crystal. The stone temple walls now reflect warm golden tones instead of cold grey. Text overlay at the bottom in a warm cream-colored rounded rectangle banner reads: "A tiny smile crept across his face — the first smile he'd smiled in a very long time." in a playful, rounded children's book font, dark brown color. Ultra-high detail, clean edges, smooth glossy textures. No watermarks. Square format, 1024x1024.
