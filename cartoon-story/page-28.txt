PROMPT:
Create a high-quality 3D cartoon illustration in a Pixar-inspired chibi style. The scene shows a beautiful ceremonial moment at the top of the pyramid temple. Sombra the shadow monkey — dark grey-purple shimmering fur, big violet eyes earnest and sincere, long curly tail hanging still — stands on the stone altar holding the sun crystal out in front of him with both tiny hands, arms fully extended, offering it to Ixchel. The crystal blazes with warm golden light in his hands, illuminating his face from below. His expression is sincere and apologetic — humble but no longer afraid. Ixchel — warm brown skin, large expressive dark brown eyes glistening with pride and warmth, long black hair in two braids with turquoise beads, white dress with Aztec patterns now glowing golden from the crystal's light — reaches out with both hands to gently accept the crystal. Her smile is warm and forgiving. Sol the baby jaguar stands beside them, tail wagging like a happy dog, bright green eyes full of joy. The golden light from the crystal is now so strong it pushes back the grey — the immediate area around them is bathed in warm, beautiful golden light. The moment feels sacred and tender. Text overlay at the bottom in a warm cream-colored rounded rectangle banner reads: "'I'm sorry I took it,' he said in a tiny voice. 'I just didn't want to be alone.'" in a playful, rounded children's book font, dark brown color. Ultra-high detail, clean edges, smooth glossy textures. No watermarks. Square format, 1024x1024.
