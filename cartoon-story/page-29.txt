"They walked home together — all three of them. Sombra rode on Sol's back, and for the first time, the jungle didn't feel dark at all."

PROMPT:
Create a high-quality 3D cartoon illustration in a Pixar-inspired chibi style. The scene shows a heartwarming journey scene on the mountain path heading downward through the jungle. Ixchel — a 6-year-old girl with warm brown skin, large expressive dark brown eyes happy and content, long black hair in two braids with turquoise beads swinging as she walks, white dress with Aztec patterns — walks along the jungle path carrying the sun crystal in both hands against her chest. The crystal glows warmly, casting a moving sphere of golden light around the group that illuminates the jungle path and the foliage on either side, making flowers open and colors return wherever the light touches. Sol the baby jaguar — golden-orange fur with rosette spots, bright green eyes — walks happily beside Ixchel. On Sol's back, riding like a tiny jockey, sits Sombra the shadow monkey — dark grey-purple fur, big violet eyes now bright and happy, long curly tail wrapped gently around Sol's middle for balance — grinning with delight, one tiny hand holding onto Sol's ear for balance. All three characters are radiating happiness and friendship. The jungle around them is transitioning from grey to green as the crystal's light passes through. Birds are returning to branches. Butterflies flutter near the light. Text overlay at the bottom in a warm cream-colored rounded rectangle banner reads: "Sombra rode on Sol's back, and for the first time, the jungle didn't feel dark at all." in a playful, rounded children's book font, dark brown color. Ultra-high detail, clean edges, smooth glossy textures. No watermarks. Square format, 1024x1024.
