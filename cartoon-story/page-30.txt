PROMPT:
Create a high-quality 3D cartoon illustration in a Pixar-inspired chibi style. The most visually spectacular scene in the book. Ixchel — a 6-year-old girl with warm brown skin, large expressive dark brown eyes blazing with triumph, long black hair in two braids with turquoise beads streaming in the burst of wind, white dress with Aztec patterns rippling — stands at the top of the village pyramid, having just placed the sun crystal back on its pedestal. The crystal ERUPTS with magnificent golden light — enormous rays blasting outward in all directions like a sunrise explosion. A shockwave of golden light and sparkles radiates outward from the crystal, washing over the entire village below. Everything the light touches transforms: grey flowers burst into vibrant reds, yellows, and purples; trees flush brilliant green; birds take flight in colorful flocks. Below the pyramid, dozens of chibi villagers cheer with arms raised, jumping, hugging, dancing. Sol the baby jaguar sits at the pyramid base looking up proudly. Sombra the shadow monkey sits on Sol's head, shielding his eyes from the brightness but grinning from ear to ear. The sky transforms from grey to brilliant blue with golden-tinged clouds. The moment is pure joy and spectacle. Text overlay at the bottom in a warm cream-colored rounded rectangle banner reads: "WHOOOOSH! Golden light burst across the sky. The whole village cheered!" in a playful, rounded children's book font, dark brown color. Ultra-high detail, clean edges, smooth glossy textures. No watermarks. Square format, 1024x1024.
