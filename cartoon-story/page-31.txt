"The villagers gave Sombra a little house right next to Ixchel's, with a window that caught the crystal's light every morning. He never felt lonely again."

PROMPT:
Create a high-quality 3D cartoon illustration in a Pixar-inspired chibi style. The scene shows the village restored to its full warm, vibrant beauty. In the foreground, three characters stand together in a friendship pose. Ixchel — a 6-year-old girl with warm brown skin, large expressive dark brown eyes beaming with happiness, long black hair in two braids with turquoise beads, white dress with Aztec patterns — stands in the center with her arms around her two friends. On her left, Sol the baby jaguar — golden-orange fur with rosette spots, oversized bright green eyes, small pink nose — leans into her side, purring happily. On her right, Sombra the shadow monkey — dark grey-purple shimmering fur now looking healthier and fluffier, big violet eyes bright and joyful, long curly tail curled into a happy spiral above his head — holds Ixchel's hand with his tiny fingers, grinning widely. Behind them, the village is alive with color — bright flowers blooming, villagers walking and smiling, the pyramid glowing warmly in the background. To the right, a small, cute adobe house with a round window is decorated with a little sign that reads "Sombra" — golden light from the crystal streams through the window. The sky is brilliant blue with fluffy white clouds. Everything is warm, golden, and alive. Text overlay at the bottom in a warm cream-colored rounded rectangle banner reads: "He never felt lonely again." in a playful, rounded children's book font, dark brown color. Ultra-high detail, clean edges, smooth glossy textures. No watermarks. Square format, 1024x1024.
