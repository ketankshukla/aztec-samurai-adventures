PROMPT:
Create a high-quality 3D cartoon illustration in a Pixar-inspired chibi style. The final scene — a beautiful, peaceful nighttime image. On the flat roof of Ixchel's adobe house, a soft woven blanket in warm red and gold Aztec patterns is spread out. On the blanket, Ixchel — a 6-year-old girl with warm brown skin, large expressive dark brown eyes peacefully closed, long black hair freed from her braids and fanning out softly around her head on a small pillow, white dress with Aztec patterns — sleeps on her back with a serene, content smile. Curled up against her right side, Sol the baby jaguar — golden-orange fur with rosette spots, oversized bright green eyes closed, small pink nose, chubby paws tucked under his chin — purrs softly in his sleep, his body gently rising and falling with each breath. Curled up against her left side, Sombra the shadow monkey — dark grey-purple fur, violet eyes closed, long curly tail draped gently across Ixchel's arm — sleeps with a peaceful smile, his tiny hand resting on Sol's paw across Ixchel's middle, connecting all three. Above them, a magnificent night sky filled with thousands of stars — rendered in stunning detail with varying sizes and brightness, the Milky Way visible as a soft luminous band. The village pyramid is silhouetted in the background, its crystal giving off a gentle, warm golden nightlight glow. Fireflies drift lazily in the warm night air. The scene radiates absolute peace, safety, and love. At the bottom, text in a warm cream-colored rounded rectangle banner reads: "Warm, safe, and loved. The End." in a playful, rounded children's book font, dark brown color. Below that, smaller text reads: "Written by Ketan Shukla" in the same font. Ultra-high detail, clean edges, smooth glossy textures. No watermarks. Square format, 1024x1024.
