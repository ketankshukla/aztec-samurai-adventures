## Amazon Book Description (HTML formatted)

<b>Four books. One reluctant warrior. The war that will decide the fate of all worlds.</b>

<p>When the Dominion raids her temple and steals a sacred relic, warrior Itzil is thrust into a war she never expected -- armed with a blade of pure sunlight that hasn't manifested in three hundred years. Now she must gather allies, outsmart an empire, and become the leader the world needs -- even though she's not sure she's the leader anyone wants.</p>

<p><b>This box set contains the first four books of the Aztec Samurai Adventures series:</b></p>

<ul>
<li><b>Book 1: Sunblade Rising - A Blade Forged in Light</b> -- A reluctant warrior discovers an impossible weapon, assembles a team of broken brilliant people, and strikes the first blow against an empire built on stolen souls.</li>
<li><b>Book 2: The Mirror Siege - Reflections of Betrayal</b> -- The Dominion attacks from every reflection. One scout goes behind enemy lines to destroy the mirror-portals while three cities burn. A legendary exile sensei joins the fight.</li>
<li><b>Book 3: Ash Oaths - Bonds Written in Blood</b> -- The war moves from battlefields to negotiations. The alliance's most dangerous diplomat walks into the Dominion's political machine, where every handshake hides a blade.</li>
<li><b>Book 4: The Starless Crown - The Darkness Unveiled</b> -- The liberation should have been a turning point. Instead, it was a trap. And the thing that descends from the sky is worse than any empire.</li>
</ul>

<p>Act I: The Rising follows Itzil and her growing team through discovery, alliance, and first victories -- but the cost is higher than anyone imagined, and the true enemy has only just announced itself.</p>
