CONCEPT: The heroes scattered and broken — four figures separated across a fractured landscape, each isolated in their own pool of light within an overwhelming darkness. The image is divided into four visual zones by jagged cracks of golden light running through a dark obsidian surface — like a shattered mirror or broken blade.

TOP-LEFT ZONE: Kaelen in his Dominion officer's disguise, half his face in shadow, half lit by crimson ash-candle light — the spy lost between identities (Book 5).

TOP-RIGHT ZONE: Rainara standing in obsidian rain, arms spread, turquoise water-magic creating a small dome of protection around her — the mystic fighting a poisoned world (Book 6).

BOTTOM-LEFT ZONE: Skyren on her war-hawk, diving through clouds, the collapsing sky-prison behind her — the hawk rider stitching the broken alliance together (Book 7).

BOTTOM-RIGHT ZONE (largest, center-weighted): Itzil kneeling with the broken Sun-Blade halves, tears on her face, ash falling around her — the commander at her lowest point (Book 8).

The four zones are separated by jagged golden cracks — the fracture lines of the broken blade writ large across the entire cover. The Starless Crown dominates the upper sky — larger and more threatening than on any individual cover, its void-tendrils reaching deep into the scene. The overall darkness is pervasive — this is the darkest box set cover, representing the series' nadir.

But at the very center where all four cracks meet, a tiny point of ember-orange light glows — the dying heart of the broken blade, refusing to go completely dark. The promise that the fire is not out.
