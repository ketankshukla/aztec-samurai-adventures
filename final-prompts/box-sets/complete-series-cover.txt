A breathtaking ultra-high-resolution photorealistic box set cover rendered at 1600x2400 pixels, 300 DPI, in sharp cinematic digital style. ABSOLUTELY NO oil painting, NO watercolor, NO painterly brushstrokes.

CONCEPT: The ultimate series image — a single, iconic composition that captures the entire 12-book journey in one frame. The image is divided vertically into three visual bands that blend seamlessly into each other, representing the three acts:

LEFT BAND (Act I - The Rising): Golden dawn light, the Sun-Blade temple, the cracked Demon Gate archway. The mood is hope and discovery. Warm gold and turquoise tones dominate. Faint silhouettes of the original team (Itzil, Kaelen, Jagren, Torvane, Neyla) are visible in the golden haze, small figures on a temple step, looking outward toward adventure.

CENTER BAND (Act II - The Breaking): Darkness, fracture, and fire. The obsidian rain falls. The Starless Crown presses down from above. Broken mirror-shards float. The corrupted river flows black-violet. Flames from burning cities illuminate scattered, isolated figures in the darkness. The center band is the visual valley — the lowest, darkest point of the journey. A broken blade lies on scorched earth, its ember-glow the only warm light.

RIGHT BAND (Act III - The Reckoning): Brilliant sunrise breaking through the shattering Starless Crown. The Dominion capital's gates stand open. The allied army surges forward. And at the very right edge, the healing landscape — green valleys, clear rivers, rebuilt villages, birds in a sky full of returning stars. The right band is the visual crescendo — the brightest, most hopeful portion of the image.

At the CENTER of the entire composition, bridging all three bands, stands Itzil — the one constant across all twelve books. She is rendered at larger scale than any background figures — not a silhouette but a fully detailed portrait from the waist up, facing the viewer. Her face shows a composite expression — the uncertainty of Book 1 in her eyes, the grief of Book 8 in the tension of her jaw, the clarity of Book 11 in the set of her mouth, and the peace of Book 12 in the warmth of her gaze. She holds the Sun-Blade vertically before her — and the blade's golden light is the SINGLE brightest element in the entire image, a column of radiance that cuts through all three acts, connecting dawn to darkness to new dawn. The blade IS the through-line. She IS the through-line.

Her warrior braids are immaculate, her armor gleaming with the solar calendar filigree, her quetzal-feather crest magnificent. She is breathtakingly beautiful — the face that launched a twelve-book war and ended it. Her obsidian-dark eyes with their golden amber striations hold the viewer's gaze with calm, earned authority.

Flanking her at a slight distance, smaller but recognizable: Kaelen at her left (pale eyes, dark armor, the hint of a rare smile), and at her right, the silhouettes of the full ensemble standing together against the sunrise — the final image from Book 12, rendered as a background element that rewards close inspection.

The series logo emblem (the obsidian/jade/gold sun-disc katana medallion from the branding prompt) is rendered as a subtle watermark in the center of the blade's golden light — barely visible but present, like a seal of authenticity.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE: Itzil's face centered at 65-70% from top. Top 40% for text and sky transitions.

MOOD: Epic, comprehensive, definitive — the feeling of holding an entire world in your hands. The cover must work at thumbnail (the golden blade and three-act color transition create instant visual identity) and at full resolution (every detail of Itzil's face, every figure in the background, every element of the three-act transition is individually beautiful). This is the cover that says: THIS is the complete journey. Start here. End here. Miss nothing.

PHOTOREALISTIC CINEMATIC DIGITAL ART. NO oil painting. NO watercolor. NO traditional media.
