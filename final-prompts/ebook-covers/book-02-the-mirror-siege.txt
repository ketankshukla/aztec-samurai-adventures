A breathtaking ultra-high-resolution photorealistic book cover rendered at 1600x2400 pixels, 300 DPI, in sharp cinematic digital style with advanced volumetric lighting, ray-traced reflections, and subsurface skin scattering. This must look like a $200-million Hollywood movie poster — every surface, every texture, every particle of light rendered with obsessive photographic precision. ABSOLUTELY NO oil painting, NO watercolor, NO painterly brushstrokes, NO soft-focus artistic filters, NO traditional media aesthetic whatsoever. Every pixel must be razor-sharp, hyper-detailed, and cinematically lit.

SUBJECT — DYNAMIC STEALTH PORTRAIT (MASTER SCOUT):

A devastatingly handsome young man of mixed heritage — sun-darkened olive skin suggesting desert and jungle lineage — in his mid-20s, positioned in the lower-right quadrant of the image, face centered at approximately 65-75% down from the top. He is Kaelen, the greatest scout alive, and he is captured in a moment of lethal stillness — crouched at the edge of a shattered mirror-portal, one hand braced against the fractured glass frame, the other gripping a long curved hunting knife reversed along his forearm. His body is coiled like a compressed spring — every muscle defined beneath his fitted scout's armor, weight balanced on the balls of his feet, ready to explode into motion in any direction. He is half-emerged from shadow, the mirror-portal's dying light illuminating one side of his face while the other remains in darkness — a man who lives between worlds, between seen and unseen.

FACE — HYPER-DETAILED PHOTOREALISTIC BEAUTY:

His face is strikingly handsome in a sharp, angular way — the face of a predator, not a prince. High cheekbones with dramatic hollows beneath them, creating shadows that emphasize the architectural precision of his bone structure. A strong, clean jawline that could cut glass, sharpened by a perpetual lean hardness — this is a man who has never known comfort and has made that his advantage. His skin is sun-darkened olive-bronze, weathered just enough to suggest a life lived outdoors in brutal conditions — photorealistic pore detail across his nose and cheeks, the faintest sun-creasing at the outer corners of his eyes from years of squinting across bright terrain. A thin white scar runs diagonally through his left eyebrow, breaking the brow line and giving his face an asymmetric intensity that makes it impossible to look away.

His eyes are his most devastating feature — large, deep-set, and startlingly pale against his dark skin. They are the color of frozen river water — a clear, piercing grey-blue with darker slate rings around the iris edges and tiny silver flecks that catch light like crushed mica. These are the eyes of a man who sees everything and trusts nothing — watchful, intelligent, and burning with a quiet, controlled intensity that suggests immense emotion held under iron discipline. Two sharp catchlights sit in the upper portion of each iris, giving his eyes a glittering, almost predatory alertness. His lashes are dark and thick — not long, but dense, framing those extraordinary pale eyes in a way that makes them even more striking. His brows are strong, naturally shaped, one permanently broken by the scar — the intact brow slightly raised in what might be sardonic amusement or cold assessment.

His nose is straight and sharp, slightly narrow, with a barely perceptible crook from an old break that was never properly set — the nose of a fighter who learned to dodge after learning to take the hit. His lips are well-shaped — the upper lip thinner and precisely drawn, the lower lip fuller with a slight natural pout that softens the severity of his face just enough to make him magnetic rather than forbidding. His expression is perfectly controlled — a half-smile that doesn't reach his eyes, the expression of a man who uses charm as a weapon and silence as a shield. He is beautiful the way a blade is beautiful — functional, precise, and dangerous.

His jaw shows the shadow of dark stubble — three days unshaved, each hair individually visible in the light. A second scar — thinner, newer, still slightly pink — runs along the right side of his neck, disappearing beneath his collar. The interplay of light across his face is dramatic — warm amber mirror-light on his right side creating golden highlights on his cheekbone and temple, while cool silver-blue reflected light from broken mirror-glass on his left side creates an eerie, otherworldly cast across his left eye and jaw. He looks like a man caught between two realities, which is exactly what he is.

HAIR — PRACTICAL AND STRIKING:

His hair is dark — nearly black with subtle warm brown undertones that catch the light. It is cut shorter than a warrior's but longer than a soldier's — practical scout's length, falling to his collar at the back and swept away from his face in a style that suggests he cuts it himself with a knife and somehow makes it look intentional. The top is longer, falling in a natural wave across his forehead that he perpetually pushes back, creating a tousled, windswept texture. Several strands fall forward across his brow, caught in the magical wind from the dying mirror-portal, each individual hair visible and luminous where backlight catches the edges. His hair has the matte texture of someone who lives in the field — no shine, no product, just natural dark waves that frame his sharp face like a predator's mane.

ARMOR AND EQUIPMENT — SCOUT'S PRECISION:

He wears fitted scout's armor designed for silence and speed — layered dark leather reinforced with thin obsidian scale plates at the shoulders, chest, and forearms. The leather is worn to a comfortable patina — not new, not neglected, but loved in the way a craftsman loves their tools. The obsidian scales are small and overlapping, creating a surface that absorbs light rather than reflecting it — perfect for moving unseen. Beneath the armor, dark charcoal-grey fabric wraps close to his body, secured with leather cord ties rather than metal buckles (metal makes noise). His vambraces are hard dark leather tooled with subtle geometric patterns — functional, not decorative.

Across his back, a compact recurve bow is slung in a quick-draw harness — the bow's limbs are dark wood laminated with bone strips, the string waxed and gleaming. A half-full quiver rides at his right hip. Multiple knives are visible — the main hunting knife in his right hand (curved blade, single edge, wrapped leather grip), a smaller throwing knife sheathed horizontally at the small of his back, and the handle of a third knife protruding from his left boot. He carries more blades than any other team member. Each one is a promise.

His belt holds a leather pouch of flash-powder charges — small, round, sealed with wax — and a coiled length of thin dark rope. Everything about his equipment is optimized for one man operating alone behind enemy lines.

THE MIRROR-PORTAL — SCENE-DEFINING ELEMENT:

The mirror-portal he crouches beside is enormous — fifteen feet tall, framed in dark iron twisted with silver rune-script that pulses with dying violet-white energy. The mirror surface is fractured — great jagged cracks radiate from a central impact point where something struck it with tremendous force. Through the cracks, the mirror shows not a reflection but another place — a distorted, shimmering glimpse of a Dominion camp seen through warped glass, soldiers and war-beasts rendered in smeared, nightmarish fragments across the broken surface. The portal is dying — energy bleeding from the cracks in streams of silver-white light that arc and sputter like electrical discharge, casting harsh, shifting shadows across everything nearby.

Shards of broken mirror-glass float in the air around the portal — dozens of them, ranging from tiny glittering fragments to pieces the size of a man's hand, suspended by the portal's failing magnetic field. Each shard reflects a different angle of the scene — Kaelen's face appears fragmented across a dozen floating mirrors, each showing a slightly different perspective, creating a dizzying, fractured-reality effect. Some shards reflect the background. Others seem to show places that aren't here at all — a throne room, a dark laboratory, a weeping face in shadow. The mirrors are windows to everywhere.

BACKGROUND — THE SIEGE OF ARAVALLE AT NIGHT:

Behind Kaelen and slightly out of focus, the background depicts the city of Aravalle under siege — but seen from behind enemy lines, from the Dominion's side. The viewer is looking out through the portal toward the city in the distance, where the walls of Aravalle burn with points of golden fire — defenders with torches and the distant, unmistakable flare of Itzil's Sun-Blade blazing on the ramparts like a golden star. The city is under attack, and from this side of the portal, you can see the scale of it — hundreds of mirror-portals arrayed across the field, shimmering doorways in the dark, Dominion soldiers pouring through them.

The sky is deep midnight blue-black, thick with smoke from the burning city. Through breaks in the smoke, stars are visible — cold and indifferent. The ground around the portal is scorched earth — blackened grass and cracked stone from the portal's energy discharge. War-beasts — massive, armored, predatory shapes — prowl in the middle distance, their eyes glowing ember-red in the darkness.

The dominant light sources are the dying mirror-portal (silver-white, harsh, flickering), the distant golden glow of Aravalle's defenders, and the ember-red eyes of war-beasts in the dark. The interplay creates a tense, dangerous atmosphere — a man alone in enemy territory, surrounded by destruction, holding a knife and a plan.

ATMOSPHERIC EFFECTS:

Mirror-shards float and spin slowly throughout the scene, each one catching and reflecting light from different sources — creating scattered points of silver, gold, and red light that dance across every surface. Fine particles of mirror-dust hang in the air like metallic snow, glittering in the portal's dying light. Wisps of dark smoke from the distant siege drift through the frame. The overall effect is shattered beauty — a world broken into a thousand reflections, each one showing a different version of the truth.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT:

The man's face must be positioned entirely BELOW the subtitle text area and ABOVE the author name. His face occupies roughly the 55%-82% vertical zone of the image. The top 40% of the image must contain ONLY background elements — sky, smoke, distant siege, floating mirror-shards, and open space. Absolutely NO part of his face, hair, weapon, or body may enter the top 35% of the image.

TEXT — MUST BE RENDERED EXACTLY AS SPECIFIED. DO NOT ALTER, OMIT, OR REPOSITION ANY ELEMENT:

All text placement percentages are measured from the TOP of the image.

OVERALL MOOD AND QUALITY:

Tense, dangerous, coldly beautiful — the feeling of being the only person between an army and annihilation. The dominant palette is silver-white, midnight blue, and ember-red — cold mirror-light against the warm distant glow of a city fighting for its life. The image should evoke the terrifying intimacy of espionage — one man, one knife, a thousand mirrors, and the fate of three cities balanced on what he does in the next ten seconds.

Kaelen must be magnetically handsome — the kind of face that commands attention in every reflection. His beauty is sharp, dangerous, and earned through suffering. He is the dark mirror to Itzil's golden fire — where she blazes, he vanishes. Where she leads from the front, he strikes from the shadow. Together they are unstoppable. Apart, as they are on this cover, they are both terrifying.

ABSOLUTELY NO oil painting texture. NO watercolor. NO canvas grain. NO painterly edges. PHOTOREALISTIC CINEMATIC DIGITAL ART — sharp, clean, precise, and devastatingly beautiful.
