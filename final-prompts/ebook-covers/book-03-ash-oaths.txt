SUBJECT — COMMANDING DIPLOMATIC PORTRAIT (THE SILVER TONGUE):

A stunningly handsome young man of Mesoamerican-Mediterranean descent in his late 20s — Zariel, the diplomat-spymaster — positioned in the lower-right quadrant of the image, face centered at approximately 65-75% down from the top. He is captured at the precise moment of a decisive gesture — his right hand extended forward, palm up, fingers slightly curled as though offering something or commanding attention, while crimson-black magical energy spirals around his left hand held low and hidden behind his hip — the duality of diplomacy and deception in a single frame. He stands at the center of a grand negotiation chamber, poised between two worlds, belonging to neither.

FACE — HYPER-DETAILED PHOTOREALISTIC BEAUTY:

Zariel's face is the most classically beautiful of any character in the series — symmetrical, refined, and devastating. His bone structure is aristocratic perfection — high, broad cheekbones that taper to an elegant jaw, a strong chin with a subtle cleft that adds dimension, and a forehead that is high and smooth beneath immaculately groomed hair. His skin is a rich warm brown — darker than Itzil's bronze, with an undertone of deep amber that makes him glow in warm light. His complexion is flawless and luminous — photorealistic pore detail is present but minimal, as though even his skin cooperates with his need to present an immaculate surface. A faint sheen of perspiration at his temples is the only sign that the situation he's in is anything less than perfectly controlled.

His eyes are extraordinary — large, almond-shaped, and a deep, rich amber-brown so warm they appear to contain liquid gold in direct light. The irises have a complex layered quality — a darker brown outer ring containing an inner field of warm amber with tiny flecks of true gold that catch light and scatter it. These are the eyes of a man who can look into your soul and make you believe he's showing you his — while actually showing you nothing. His gaze is direct, penetrating, and magnetic — the kind of eye contact that makes powerful people shift in their seats. Two perfect catchlights sit high in each iris, giving his eyes extraordinary depth and an almost supernatural warmth. His lashes are thick and dark, naturally arched, long enough to cast delicate shadows on his upper cheekbones — lashes that would be the envy of any woman, framing those golden eyes like dark silk curtains around a treasure.

His eyebrows are immaculately shaped — naturally full and dark, with a high arch that gives his face an expression of perpetual elegant interest, as though everything in the world is a fascinating puzzle he has almost solved. His nose is strong and straight with a refined bridge — neither narrow nor broad, perfectly proportioned, the kind of nose that portrait painters would kill to capture. His lips are his most expressive feature — full, well-defined, with a natural warm burgundy-brown pigment. The upper lip has a pronounced cupid's bow that gives his mouth an almost feminine beauty, while the lower lip is fuller and softer. His mouth is currently set in the diplomat's smile — warm, open, genuine-looking, and completely, utterly calculated. Every muscle in that smile is deliberate. It is the most dangerous weapon in the room.

His jaw is clean-shaven — not a single hair, smooth as polished stone. Unlike the scarred warriors of the team, Zariel's face is unmarked — no scars, no imperfections. This itself tells a story: he has never been close enough to danger to be touched. Or he's so good at his work that danger never sees him coming.

HAIR — IMMACULATE AND STRIKING:

His hair is jet-black with a blue-black sheen — thick, lustrous, and styled with deliberate sophistication. It is swept back from his forehead in a clean, voluminous wave — longer on top, shorter at the sides, the kind of style that looks effortlessly perfect but requires careful maintenance. Every strand is in place, glossy and healthy, catching the warm candlelight of the negotiation chamber in sharp highlights. A single decorative element — a thin gold chain woven through the hair above his left ear, ending in a tiny obsidian bead — marks him as a member of the Sun-Blade order while maintaining his diplomatic cover. His hair moves slightly in an imperceptible draft, a few strands at the temples shifting to reveal the gold chain beneath.

CLOTHING — DIPLOMATIC ELEGANCE CONCEALING WARRIOR PURPOSE:

Zariel does not wear armor. He wears the robes of a high-ranking diplomatic envoy — layered garments of extraordinary quality and subtlety. The outermost layer is a long coat of deep burgundy-crimson silk — rich, heavy, with a subtle geometric weave visible at close range that depicts interlocking serpents and sun-discs in the same-color thread. The coat falls to his calves, open at the front, with wide sleeves that conceal his hands when he wishes. The collar is high and structured — Mesoamerican in design, rising to frame his jaw, edged with thin gold embroidery in stepped-pyramid patterns.

Beneath the coat, a fitted tunic of obsidian-black fabric — fine wool or cotton — with gold thread accents at the neckline and cuffs. A broad sash of deep jade-green silk wraps his waist, knotted with diplomatic precision. At his left hip, hidden beneath the coat's drape, the handle of a thin stiletto blade is barely visible — the only weapon he carries openly, and even that is disguised as a decorative letter-opener hanging from a gold chain. His boots are dark leather, knee-high, polished to a mirror shine.

A diplomatic credential hangs from his neck — a circular medallion of gold and jade on a fine chain, bearing the neutral crest of the Summit of Nations. It marks him as an envoy with diplomatic immunity. It is also, secretly, enchanted with a minor ward against blood-magic detection.

BACKGROUND — THE DOMINION COURT AT THE MOMENT OF NEGOTIATION:

Behind Zariel and slightly out of focus, the background depicts the grand audience chamber of the Dominion's diplomatic wing — a cavernous hall of dark polished stone and crimson banners. Massive columns of black marble rise into shadow, their surfaces carved with Dominion military victories rendered in relief. Crimson and gold banners hang between the columns — the Dominion's colors — each one bearing the iron crown insignia of Volzentar's empire.

The hall is lit by hundreds of floating ash-oath candles — small flames that burn with an unnatural crimson-orange light, suspended in the air without holders, casting warm but unsettling light across every surface. The flames don't flicker naturally — they pulse in unison, like a heartbeat, creating a subtle rhythmic shift in the light that makes the entire room feel alive and watchful.

In the middle distance, barely visible in the candlelight, the shapes of Dominion diplomats and military advisors are seated around a vast obsidian negotiation table — dark figures in formal robes, their faces half-lit by the ash-candles, watching Zariel with a mixture of interest and suspicion. One figure at the head of the table is larger than the others, seated in a high-backed throne — Volzentar himself, visible only as a silhouette and the glint of an iron crown catching crimson light. The implication is clear: Zariel has walked into the lion's den, and the lion is watching.

The floor is polished black stone that reflects everything like dark water — Zariel's reflection stretches beneath him, distorted slightly, as though the floor itself is an unreliable mirror. Thin streams of crimson magical energy — the ambient blood-magic that permeates all Dominion architecture — crawl along the base of the columns like luminous veins.

ATMOSPHERIC EFFECTS:

The ash-oath candle flames cast hundreds of tiny crimson-gold light points across every reflective surface — the polished floor, the marble columns, Zariel's silk coat, his gold chain. Fine particles of ash-magic drift through the air — tiny motes of crimson and grey that swirl in slow, hypnotic patterns, giving the atmosphere a hazy, dangerous warmth. Faint wisps of incense smoke — rich, dark, carrying the metallic scent of blood-magic — curl through the upper portions of the frame. The overall effect is opulent menace — a room designed to intimidate, filled with beauty that conceals threat.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT:

Zariel's face must be positioned entirely BELOW the subtitle text area and ABOVE the author name. His face occupies roughly the 55%-82% vertical zone of the image. The top 40% of the image must contain ONLY background elements — the upper reaches of the columns, crimson banners, floating ash-candles, and the dark vaulted ceiling. Absolutely NO part of his face, hair, hands, or body may enter the top 35% of the image.

TEXT — MUST BE RENDERED EXACTLY AS SPECIFIED. DO NOT ALTER, OMIT, OR REPOSITION ANY ELEMENT:

All text placement percentages are measured from the TOP of the image.

OVERALL MOOD AND QUALITY:

Opulent, dangerous, seductive — the feeling of playing a game where every word is a weapon and every smile is a trap. The dominant palette is deep crimson, polished black, and warm gold — the colors of power, wealth, and blood. Zariel must be breathtakingly beautiful in a way that is completely different from Book 1's warrior intensity or Book 2's predatory sharpness — his beauty is refined, controlled, and weaponized. He is the most dangerous person in a room full of dangerous people, and the most terrifying thing about him is that he makes it look easy.

ABSOLUTELY NO oil painting texture. NO watercolor. NO canvas grain. NO painterly edges. PHOTOREALISTIC CINEMATIC DIGITAL ART — sharp, clean, precise, and devastatingly beautiful.
