A breathtaking photorealistic full paperback wrap cover, 3878x2775 pixels, 300 DPI, CMYK. Sharp cinematic digital rendering. ABSOLUTELY NO oil painting, NO watercolor, NO painterly style. The entire wrap is a single continuous panoramic scene flowing seamlessly across back cover, spine, and front cover.

--- BACK COVER (left 1875px) ---

A haunting atmospheric scene — a field of shattered mirror-portals at night. Dozens of broken mirror-frames — twisted dark iron with silver rune-script — stand scattered across a scorched plain like the tombstones of a dead technology. Each broken mirror still holds fragments of reflective glass in its frame, and each fragment shows a different distorted image — a face, a city, a battlefield, a throne room — windows to places that can no longer be reached. The portals are dead, their energy spent, their purpose destroyed. Faint silver-white residual energy arcs weakly between some frames, like the last sparks of a dying circuit.

The ground is blackened and cracked — scorched by the portal energy that once flowed through this site. Shards of mirror-glass litter the earth, catching what little moonlight exists and scattering it in cold, sharp reflections. The sky above is deep midnight blue, heavy with smoke from a distant siege. Through breaks in the smoke, cold stars are visible. On the far horizon, barely visible, the walls of Aravalle glow with tiny points of golden firelight — the city that survived because these portals fell.

The atmosphere is cold, eerie, and beautiful — the aftermath of a technological catastrophe rendered with the reverence of a battlefield memorial.

BACK COVER TEXT (rendered on image, within safety margins):

Top 12%: "AZTEC SAMURAI ADVENTURES" — small Trajan Pro, turquoise (#40E0D0), centered, letter-spacing 0.15em.

15-18%: Thin gold and turquoise ornamental filigree divider matching series design.

20-62% (blurb area, cream/white Garamond, ~11pt, centered):

"The portals are everywhere. The enemy can strike from any reflection."

[blank line]

"When the Dominion unleashes mirror-portal technology that lets Gravok's beast army appear anywhere instantly, three allied cities face simultaneous destruction. Itzil must hold the front lines while Kaelen -- the only scout fast enough and brave enough -- infiltrates enemy territory alone to find the mirror-anchor and destroy it."

[blank line]

"Behind enemy lines, Kaelen discovers horrors worse than war: the portals are powered by trapped human souls. And in an occupied town, he meets Miyako -- a legendary exile sensei who has been hiding for decades and is ready to stop."

[blank line]

"The siege is closing. The mirrors are everywhere. And the only way to shatter them is to walk into the glass house and face the engineer who built them."

65%: Thin ornamental divider.

68%: "Book 2 of 12 in the Aztec Samurai Adventures series" — italic Garamond, cream/gold, small.

--- SPINE (center ~203px) ---

Deep obsidian-black gradient with a thin vertical line of silver-white mirror-light running through the center — colder than Book 1's golden spine-line, reflecting the mirror theme.

--- PANORAMIC CONTINUITY ---

The back cover's field of dead mirror-portals transitions through the spine's silver light-line into the front cover's single dying portal with Kaelen. The sky gradient runs continuously — deepest midnight blue at the back cover's left edge, through the spine, to the smoke-and-fire sky of the siege on the front cover's right. Mirror-shards drift across all three panels. The visual story: from the graveyard of destroyed portals, through the blade-edge of light, to the man who destroyed them.

CRITICAL: 0.125" bleed all edges. All text/important elements 0.25" inside trim. CMYK color profile. NO oil painting style.
