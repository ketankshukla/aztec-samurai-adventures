--- BACK COVER (left 1875px) ---

A sumptuous, menacing scene — the interior of a Dominion diplomatic archive at night. Floor-to-ceiling shelves of dark mahogany hold thousands of scrolls and leather-bound treaty documents, each one sealed with crimson wax bearing the iron crown sigil. The shelves curve inward, creating a claustrophobic tunnel of parchment and secrets. Ash-candles float in the air between the shelves — their crimson-orange flames casting warm but unsettling light on the gold-embossed spines of the documents. On a heavy oak desk in the foreground, an unrolled treaty document is visible — its text rendered in elegant calligraphy, with a blood-red signature at the bottom that glows faintly with ash-oath energy. A diplomatic seal — gold and jade — lies beside the document, its surface etched with the neutral crest of the Summit of Nations.

The atmosphere is rich, dangerous, and seductive — the beauty of power wielded with paperwork and promises rather than blades.

"Words are the most dangerous weapons in the Dominion's arsenal."

[blank line]

"When the alliance sends its most brilliant diplomat into the heart of the Dominion's political machine, Zariel walks into a world where every handshake hides a blade and every treaty conceals a trap. His mission: forge alliances with the neutral nations before the Dominion buys them with promises it never intends to keep."

[blank line]

"But the Dominion's contract magic -- the ash-oaths that enslave families and erase souls -- has already reached deeper than anyone knew. Nations that seem free are already bound. Leaders who seem independent are already owned."

[blank line]

"In the halls of power, the most dangerous weapon isn't a Sun-Blade. It's a silver tongue -- and Zariel's is the sharpest in the world."

65%: Ornamental divider.
68%: "Book 3 of 12 in the Aztec Samurai Adventures series" — italic Garamond, cream/gold.

--- PANORAMIC CONTINUITY ---

Back cover's archive of secrets transitions through spine's crimson-gold line into front cover's negotiation chamber. The warm ash-candle lighting is consistent across all three panels. Floating ash-candles drift across the boundaries. Visual story: from the written instruments of control, through the blade-edge of deception, to the man who plays the game better than anyone.

CRITICAL: 0.125" bleed. 0.25" safety margin. CMYK. NO oil painting.
