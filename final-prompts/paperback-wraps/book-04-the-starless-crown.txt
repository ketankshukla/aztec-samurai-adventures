--- BACK COVER (left 1875px) ---

A desolate, post-battle landscape — the far edge of the pyrrhic battlefield from the front cover, seen from ground level. Broken weapons thrust from churned earth — swords, spears, and shattered siege equipment half-buried in mud and ash. Fallen banners lie trampled — alliance colors (gold and turquoise) and Dominion colors (crimson and black) tangled together indiscriminately. A single war-beast lies dead in the middle distance — its massive armored body curled in a final spasm, ember-red eyes extinguished, dark blood pooling beneath it.

Above this devastation, the Starless Crown dominates the sky — the void constellation pressing downward, its anti-light tendrils reaching toward the ground. Stars that should be visible are swallowed by the void. The only illumination comes from scattered, dying fires and the faint crimson glow of residual blood-magic energy dissipating from fallen soldiers' ash-oath brands. The mood is devastation — the cost of a battle won at too high a price.

BACK COVER TEXT (within safety margins):

Top 12%: "AZTEC SAMURAI ADVENTURES" — small Trajan Pro, turquoise (#40E0D0), centered.
15-18%: Gold/turquoise filigree divider.

20-62% (blurb, cream/white Garamond, ~11pt, centered):

"They walked into Volzentar's trap. And the trap was the entire war."

[blank line]

"The liberation of the occupied territories should have been a turning point. Instead, it was bait. Volzentar lured the entire alliance into a single decisive battle -- and then revealed what he had been building behind the war: the Starless Crown, VASTRIX's first visible mark upon the sky."

[blank line]

"As the void descends and the stars disappear, Jagren -- the arena duelist who wanted glory -- discovers what glory actually costs. The alliance wins the battle but loses something far more precious: their certainty that the war can be won at all."

[blank line]

"The Dominion was never the real enemy. It was always something worse. Something patient. Something vast. And it has just announced itself to the world."

65%: Ornamental divider.
68%: "Book 4 of 12 in the Aztec Samurai Adventures series" — italic Garamond, cream/gold.
72%: "Published by Metronagon" — small Trajan Pro, gold.
Bottom-right (80-95%): CLEAR barcode zone.

--- SPINE (center ~203px) ---

Deep obsidian-black gradient with a thin vertical line that transitions from faint golden fire at the bottom to absolute void-black at the top — the light being consumed by darkness.

SPINE TEXT (vertical, top-to-bottom):
Upper (10-60%): "THE STARLESS CROWN" — Trajan Pro, white/cream, vertical.
Lower (65-85%): "KETAN SHUKLA" — Trajan Pro, gold, vertical.
Bottom (88-95%): Metronagon "M" mark, turquoise.

--- FRONT COVER (right 1875px) ---

Identical to Book 4 ebook cover — Jagren kneeling on the burning battlefield, bloodied and defiant, twin-bladed staff planted before him, the Starless Crown descending overhead.

FRONT COVER TEXT:
3%: "AZTEC SAMURAI ADVENTURES" — turquoise.
6%: "BOOK IV" — gold, flanked by lines.
10-22%: "THE STARLESS / CROWN" — large Trajan Pro, white/cream with violet-black edge glow.
24%: Filigree divider.
26%: "The Darkness Unveiled" — italic, cream with violet undertone.
28%: Matching divider.
92%: "KETAN SHUKLA" — large, white/cream.

--- PANORAMIC CONTINUITY ---

Back cover's desolate aftermath transitions through spine's dying-light line into front cover's active battle with Jagren. The Starless Crown spans the entire sky across all three panels. Visual story: from the cost already paid, through the fading edge of hope, to the man who refuses to stop fighting even as the sky itself turns against him.

CRITICAL: 0.125" bleed. 0.25" safety margin. CMYK. NO oil painting.
