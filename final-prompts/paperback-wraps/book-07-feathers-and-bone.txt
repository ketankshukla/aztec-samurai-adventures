--- BACK COVER (left 1875px) ---

A solemn, windswept scene — a high mountain cliff edge at sunset. On the clifftop, a small memorial cairn built from stacked stones, each stone individually placed with care. Atop the cairn rests a single katana — Miyako's weapon — laid horizontally across the peak stone, its blade catching the dying sunlight in a sharp orange-gold reflection. A thin white silk ribbon is tied to the katana's grip, fluttering in the high-altitude wind. Scattered around the base of the cairn, hawk feathers — brown and white, barred and spotted — have been placed in a circle as offerings.

The cliff overlooks a vast expanse of cloud-sea below — the tops of clouds stretching to the horizon like a white ocean, catching the sunset in bands of coral, gold, and deep violet. Above, the sky transitions from warm amber at the horizon to cold deep blue at the zenith. A single war-hawk — tiny, silhouetted — circles in the far distance, its wings spread in a wide, searching pattern. The mood is grief rendered as beauty — the memorial of a warrior who taught others to fight and then proved that some fights demand everything.

--- PANORAMIC CONTINUITY ---

Back cover's memorial cairn and cloud-sea sunset transitions through spine's amber light into front cover's blazing aerial combat. The sky runs continuously — from the peaceful, mournful sunset of the memorial through to the brilliant, dangerous blue of combat altitude. A single hawk's flight path could be imagined connecting back to front. Visual story: from the price paid, through the golden thread of memory, to the wings that carry the fight forward.

CRITICAL: 0.125" bleed. 0.25" safety margin. CMYK. NO oil painting.
