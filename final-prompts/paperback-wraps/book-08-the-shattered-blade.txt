--- BACK COVER (left 1875px) ---

The most emotionally devastating back cover in the series. A single image: a pair of hands — Itzil's hands, recognizable by the crescent scar visible on the left wrist — held open, palms up, in an empty gesture of loss. The hands are rendered in extreme close-up photorealism, filling the center of the back panel. They are scarred, calloused, strong — warrior's hands. But they are empty. No blade. No golden light. No power. Between the fingers, grey ash drifts downward — the residue of the broken blade's energy, dispersing like the last grains of sand through an hourglass.

The background is minimal — deep grey-black darkness, the barest suggestion of a mountain pass in fog. The lighting is cold — a single diffuse source from above, creating soft shadows in the palms and between the fingers. No warmth. No color. Just hands that held the most powerful weapon in the world and now hold nothing.

BACK COVER TEXT (within safety margins):

Top 12%: "AZTEC SAMURAI ADVENTURES" — small Trajan Pro, turquoise (#40E0D0), centered.
15-18%: Gold/turquoise filigree divider — with the same visual crack/break as the front cover divider.

20-62% (blurb, cream/white Garamond, ~11pt, centered):

"The blade is broken. The mentor is gone. And the woman who carried the light of the world has nothing left."

[blank line]

"When Itzil's Sun-Blade shatters in the battle that kills Korvain, everything she relied on -- her weapon, her certainty, her sense of purpose -- dies with him. The Dominion controls seventy percent of the known world. VASTRIX's Starless Crown devours the sky. And the prophesied Sun-Blade bearer kneels in ash with two broken halves of a dead sword."

[blank line]

"But fire doesn't die. It just needs someone willing to hold the heat long enough for the metal to remember its shape."

[blank line]

"This is the story of a woman who lost everything and discovered she was never defined by what she held -- but by who she is."

65%: Ornamental divider — cracked, matching front cover.
68%: "Book 8 of 12 in the Aztec Samurai Adventures series" — italic Garamond, cream/gold.
72%: "Published by Metronagon" — small Trajan Pro, gold.
Bottom-right (80-95%): CLEAR barcode zone.

--- SPINE (~203px) ---

Deep obsidian-black gradient with a thin vertical line that is BROKEN at the midpoint — the line runs as fading ember-orange from the bottom to the center, disappears for a gap of about 20 pixels, then resumes as a dimmer line from the gap to the top. The broken spine-line mirrors the broken blade.

SPINE TEXT (vertical, top-to-bottom):
Upper (10-60%): "THE SHATTERED BLADE" — Trajan Pro, white/cream, vertical.
Lower (65-85%): "KETAN SHUKLA" — Trajan Pro, gold, vertical.
Bottom (88-95%): Metronagon "M" mark, turquoise.

--- FRONT COVER (right 1875px) ---

Identical to Book 8 ebook cover — Itzil kneeling with broken blade halves, tears tracking down her face, Korvain's fading light circle in the background, ash-choked sky with the Starless Crown overhead.

FRONT COVER TEXT:
3%: "AZTEC SAMURAI ADVENTURES" — turquoise, muted.
6%: "BOOK VIII" — gold, flanked by lines.
10-22%: "THE SHATTERED / BLADE" — large Trajan Pro, white/cream with ember-glow edges. Crack through the "A" in BLADE.
24%: Cracked filigree divider.
26%: "Forged Through Fire" — italic, warm amber/cream.
28%: Matching cracked divider.
92%: "KETAN SHUKLA" — large, white/cream.

--- PANORAMIC CONTINUITY ---

Back cover's empty hands transitions through spine's broken light-line into front cover's kneeling Itzil with the broken blade. The ash falls continuously across all panels. The darkness is pervasive. Visual story: from what remains when everything is taken, through the gap where hope used to be, to the woman who must decide if she can become something the blade never was.

CRITICAL: 0.125" bleed. 0.25" safety margin. CMYK. NO oil painting.
