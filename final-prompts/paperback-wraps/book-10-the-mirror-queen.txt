--- BACK COVER (left 1875px) ---

A surreal, disorienting scene — the deep interior of the Mirror-Realm, viewed as though standing in a hallway made entirely of mirrors. Floor, walls, ceiling — all reflective surfaces stretching to infinity. But the reflections are wrong. Each mirror surface shows a different scene: a child crying in a burned village, a soldier swearing an ash-oath with dead eyes, a woman reaching through glass with desperate hands, a throne room where Mirathane sits with a cold smile. The reflections overlap and contradict each other — multiple realities layered in a single space.

In the very center of the floor, a pool of turquoise light — Neyla's healing energy — spreads outward in a perfect circle, the only warm element in the cold, silver-glass environment. Where the turquoise light touches the mirror-floor, the false reflections dissolve, replaced by a simple, honest reflection of the real ceiling above. Truth replacing illusion.

The atmosphere is beautiful, threatening, and claustrophobic — a world designed to trap the mind in infinite reflections of its own fear.

BACK COVER TEXT (within safety margins):

Top 12%: "AZTEC SAMURAI ADVENTURES" — small Trajan Pro, turquoise (#40E0D0), centered.
15-18%: Gold/turquoise filigree divider.

20-62% (blurb, cream/white Garamond, ~11pt, centered):

"In the Mirror-Realm, your reflection is your enemy. And the queen of mirrors knows exactly who you're afraid of becoming."

[blank line]

"Neyla's healing gift -- the power to break ash-oaths and free enslaved souls -- has become the alliance's most devastating weapon. The Dominion's infrastructure crumbles as every liberated soldier weakens Volzentar's grip. But to reach the thousands still enslaved, Neyla must enter the Mirror-Realm itself -- a dimension of shattered glass ruled by Mirathane, the assassin who kills with reflections."

[blank line]

"In the realm of mirrors, healing is an act of war. Compassion is the sharpest blade. And the gentlest person in the alliance must face the most merciless killer in the Dominion."

[blank line]

"Sometimes the bravest thing you can do is refuse to fight -- and heal instead."

65%: Ornamental divider.
68%: "Book 10 of 12 in the Aztec Samurai Adventures series" — italic Garamond, cream/gold.
72%: "Published by Metronagon" — small Trajan Pro, gold.
Bottom-right (80-95%): CLEAR barcode zone.

--- SPINE (~203px) ---

Deep obsidian-black gradient with a thin vertical line of turquoise healing-light — warm, gentle, steady. The line is reflected on both sides by faint silver mirror-light, creating a triple-line effect — the true light flanked by its reflections.

SPINE TEXT (vertical, top-to-bottom):
Upper (10-60%): "THE MIRROR QUEEN" — Trajan Pro, white/cream, vertical.
Lower (65-85%): "KETAN SHUKLA" — Trajan Pro, gold, vertical.
Bottom (88-95%): Metronagon "M" mark, turquoise.

--- FRONT COVER (right 1875px) ---

Identical to Book 10 ebook cover — Neyla healing the ash-oath slave, turquoise energy shattering crimson sigils, the Mirror-Realm stretching to infinity behind her, Mirathane's face fragmented across distant mirrors.

FRONT COVER TEXT:
3%: "AZTEC SAMURAI ADVENTURES" — turquoise.
6%: "BOOK X" — gold, flanked by lines.
10-22%: "THE MIRROR / QUEEN" — large Trajan Pro, white/cream with mirrored-surface quality.
24%: Filigree divider with shattered-mirror/healing motifs.
26%: "Realm of Shattered Glass" — italic, cream/silver.
28%: Matching divider.
92%: "KETAN SHUKLA" — large, white/cream.

--- PANORAMIC CONTINUITY ---

Back cover's infinite mirror-hallway transitions through spine's reflected triple-light into front cover's healing scene. The Mirror-Realm's cold silver reflections dominate back and spine, yielding to the warm turquoise of Neyla's healing on the front. Visual story: from the trap of infinite false reflections, through the thread of true light, to the woman who heals what mirrors can only distort.

CRITICAL: 0.125" bleed. 0.25" safety margin. CMYK. NO oil painting.
