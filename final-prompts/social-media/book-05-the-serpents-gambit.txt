SCENE: A wide shot of a Dominion intelligence corridor at night — dark polished stone, crimson carpet, flickering ash-candle sconces. The corridor is split down the center by a razor-thin vertical line of golden light. On the left side, the corridor appears normal — well-lit, orderly. On the right side, the same corridor from a different angle — darker, with a figure's shadow pressed flat against the wall, a coiled rope visible, an escape in progress. In the center of the frame, where the golden line cuts through, a single discarded Dominion officer's rank insignia lies on the carpet. The dual-reality effect creates immediate visual intrigue.

SCENE: Tight portrait of Kaelen split down the center by a golden line — left half shows the scout (dark leather, tousled hair, pale eyes vulnerable and alert, stubble), right half shows the Dominion officer (crimson coat, slicked hair, kohl-lined eye, clean-shaven, cold and confident). The same devastating face, two completely different people. Background split — cool midnight blue left, warm crimson-gold right.
