SCENE: A wide-angle shot of a corrupted river valley — the river running thick and black-violet, pulsing with crimson blood-magic veins beneath its surface. Obsidian rain falls from a volcanic grey sky — tiny black glass shards streaking downward, accumulating on every surface. In the center-right of the frame, a figure stands in the rain — Rainara — arms spread, a dome of brilliant turquoise purified water-mist forming above her, the obsidian shards dissolving harmlessly where they hit her shield. Around her, a small circle of clean ground contrasts with the devastation everywhere else. The corrupted river nearest her is beginning to clear — a streak of turquoise blue cutting through the black-violet water.

SCENE: Tight portrait of Rainara from chest up. Her ethereally beautiful face is wet with water — droplets clinging to her skin like liquid jewels, some floating upward in defiance of gravity, caught by her water magic. Her eyes blaze with turquoise-white energy, pupils gone, irises burning with luminous blue-green light. Trails of turquoise mist stream from the corners of her eyes. Her wet blue-black hair floats weightlessly around her face. Water spirals in the background, glowing turquoise. The overall effect is supernatural beauty — a goddess of water emerging from the storm.
