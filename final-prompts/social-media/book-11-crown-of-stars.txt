SCENE: A wide-angle epic shot — the allied army surging through the breached outer wall of the Dominion capital. Thousands of soldiers pour through a massive gap in the black stone wall, banners of every allied nation flying above them. War-hawks circle overhead — tiny silhouettes against a sky where the Starless Crown is visibly shrinking, stars returning around its crumbling edges. Dawn light breaks on the eastern horizon, golden and unstoppable. In the center of the charge, a single blazing point of golden fire — Itzil's Sun-Blade — leads the way through the breach, its light spreading outward like a beacon. The scale is enormous — a siege that spans the entire frame, the culmination of eleven books of preparation.

SCENE: Tight portrait of Itzil from chest up — the most powerful version of her in the series. Her breathtaking face is lit by the golden fire of her reforged Sun-Blade from below. Her obsidian-dark eyes blaze with golden amber striations that genuinely glow with inner fire — synchronized with the blade, filled with absolute clarity. Her warrior braids are immaculate, threaded with turquoise beads, gold rings, and obsidian studs. The quetzal-feather crest catches golden light in iridescent flashes. Her new armor gleams — the full solar calendar sun-disc filigree visible on her chest guard. Behind her, the dawn sky breaks golden through the Starless Crown's crumbling edges. Stars return. She is transcendent.
