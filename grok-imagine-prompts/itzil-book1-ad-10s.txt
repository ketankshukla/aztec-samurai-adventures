VIDEO DESCRIPTION / MOTION PROMPT:

Cinematic close-up to medium shot of Itzil, the Mesoamerican warrior woman. She stands before ancient temple ruins under a dramatic twilight sky filled with stars and swirling golden clouds. Her long dark braided hair with turquoise beads drifts gently in a warm breeze. Her golden amber eyes are fierce, confident, and locked directly into the camera.

She grips her flaming Sun-Blade sword in her right hand — the blade pulses and flickers with living golden-orange fire, casting warm dancing light across her face and ornate bronze warrior armor. Golden sparks and embers drift slowly upward from her left hand, which glows with radiant sun energy.

Her expression is powerful and commanding. She speaks directly to the viewer with authority and conviction, her lips moving naturally and precisely in sync with every word. Her jaw, mouth, and facial muscles move realistically as she delivers her line. She does not whisper. She does not shout. She speaks with the calm, steady power of a warrior who has seen war and chosen to fight anyway.

At the end of her line, she raises her Sun-Blade slightly — the flame intensifies with a bright golden flare that illuminates the entire frame for a brief, dramatic moment before the video ends.

SPOKEN DIALOGUE (lip-synced, 10 seconds):

"Buy book one of this epic saga on Amazon today!"

Voice direction: Female, mid-20s, strong and clear. Confident warrior tone — not aggressive, not soft. Measured, powerful, like a commander addressing her people. Slight dramatic pause after "epic saga" for emphasis.

AUDIO / MUSIC DIRECTION:

Background score: A single, sustained orchestral string swell — cellos and violins holding one rich, warm, resonant chord that slowly builds in intensity across the full 10 seconds. NOT staccato. NOT choppy. NOT rhythmic percussion. One continuous, unbroken, cinematic orchestral tone that swells gradually from quiet to powerful.

At second 8, a single deep brass note (French horn) joins the strings for the final flare moment, adding dramatic weight as the Sun-Blade brightens.

The music must be smooth, continuous, and uninterrupted — like a single breath drawn across the entire 10 seconds. No cuts, no breaks, no rhythmic hits, no drums, no percussion of any kind. Pure orchestral strings and brass only.

Mix levels: Music at 30% volume. Voice at 100% volume. The voice must always be clearly dominant over the music. The music supports — it never competes.

CAMERA MOTION:

Extremely slow, almost imperceptible push-in zoom from medium shot to close-up over the full 10 seconds. The camera drifts forward smoothly and steadily — no shaking, no handheld feel, no sudden movements. Pure cinematic dolly glide. By the final frame, her face fills the screen as the blade flares.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

LIGHTING:

Warm golden-hour lighting from the left, cast by the flaming Sun-Blade. Cool blue-purple ambient fill from the right, cast by the twilight sky. The contrast between warm fire and cool sky creates a dramatic cinematic split-lighting effect on her face. Golden embers and light particles float slowly through the air around her.

WHAT TO AVOID:

- No choppy or staccato music — the score must be one continuous swell
- No drums, percussion, or rhythmic beats of any kind
- No rapid camera movement or jump cuts
- No cartoonish or exaggerated facial expressions
- No background characters or distracting motion
- No text overlays or watermarks
- No blinking or eye-closing during the spoken line
- No mouth movement that does not match the spoken words exactly
- No whispering — the voice must be strong and clear

SUMMARY FOR QUICK PASTE:

A powerful Mesoamerican warrior woman with dark braided hair, turquoise beads, golden eyes, and ornate bronze armor stands before ancient temple ruins at twilight. She holds a flaming golden sword that casts warm light across her face. Golden sparks drift from her glowing left hand. She looks directly into the camera with fierce confidence and speaks clearly: "Buy book one of this epic saga on Amazon today!" The camera slowly pushes in. A smooth, continuous orchestral string swell builds gently behind her voice. At the end, she raises her blade — it flares with brilliant golden light. Her voice is always louder than the music. The music is one unbroken, sustained orchestral chord — no drums, no percussion, no choppy beats. Pure cinematic power.
