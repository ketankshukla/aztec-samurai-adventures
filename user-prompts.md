## 🔖 PROMPT #4 — February 9, 2026, ~2:58 PM PST

### Request: Updates to Plan + Answers to Questions + New Requirements

**New Requirements:**

- Add **elderly characters on BOTH sides** — protagonist elders give solid constructive advice for winning; antagonist elders give solid destructive advice for winning. Language of both sides must clearly show/express their intentions
- Create this **user-prompts.md file** as a running tally of all prompts
- **Chapter length changed to 1,500 words** (user will hold to this — must not fall short)

**Answers to Discussion Questions:**

1. **Chapter length:** 1,500 words per chapter (confirmed, strict)
2. **Villain POV:** Yes, include villain perspective chapters
3. **Hero-villain cover pairing:** Yes, but they must look like they're **fighting each other** — not just standing side by side. Use different facial expressions and striking poses for variations. Wizards/warlocks use lightning bolts and creative magic effects, not just swords. Protagonist samurai warriors use swords + other weapons too.
4. **New characters:** Yes, phase them in across later books, not all 20 at once. Every character on a cover must look **completely distinct** — memorable, unforgettable, unique facial features, appearance, and weapons. No two characters should look similar.
5. **Romance:** Yes, include romance subplots. **Rename characters** to have names that are easy to pronounce and remember. Aztec-samurai fusion names that sound awesome and cool (not simple like John/Mary). Villain names should sound powerful and menacing (like "Dalenthar," "Voltar"). There is power in a name — the reader should perceive the character's image from the name alone. Names must be uniquely memorable.
6. **Character deaths:** User is unsure how to handle this. Doesn't want loveable characters to die quickly (would prevent readers from buying further books). Needs guidance — should they die at the end or during the series? Wants a strategy discussion.
7. **Cover prompts clarification:** User wants elaboration on the difference between "character reference prompts" and "story-specific prompts" so they have a clear understanding.

**Process Instructions:**

- Update `book-ideas.md` with all the above changes
- Create `user-prompts.md` (this file) for running tally
- Update the prompts file before every GitHub push
- Do NOT create content yet — update planning docs only, then discuss

## 🔖 PROMPT #5 — February 9, 2026, ~3:53 PM PST

### Request: Major Plan Updates + Many Discussion Topics

**New Requirements:**

- Add **elderly characters on both sides** (confirmed from Prompt #4) — protagonist elders give constructive advice, antagonist elders give destructive advice. Language must clearly express intentions.
- **CLARITY section update:** Add "Where We're Headed" alongside "Where We Have Been" — readers should always know both directions
- **Start the saga from SCRATCH** — don't expand the original 7-book outline. Design everything fresh since no chapters have been written yet.
- **Rename main character** from Xochitl to **Itzil** (CONFIRMED)
- **No accented characters in names.** Names must be phonetically smooth and flowing. Villain names should sound like pirate/Scandinavian (endings in -ar, -thar, -zar). "Alberico sounds like a guy who sells tacos." Use names like Dalenthar, Volzentar. Hero names must sound cool and memorable but not simple (no John/Mary).
- **Every book must tell the reader** where they've been AND where they're headed — in the book itself AND in the Amazon book description.
- **Cover image backgrounds must be SHARP and REALISTIC** — no oil painting look, no fuzzy/blurred backgrounds. Super detailed photorealistic backgrounds with clear visible battles. Text structure stays the same (it's fantastic).
- **Reference these prompt folders** when creating cover image prompts:
  - `E:\reality-without-belief\reality-prompts\`
  - `E:\repetition-mother-of-mastery\golden-prompts-v2\`
- **Series conclusion must be inspiring** with lessons learned, empowering content.
- **Series epilogue** must tell reader what to look forward to next (like every book epilogue does). User needs suggestions for epilogue approaches.

**Questions Raised by User (for discussion, no action yet):**

1. **Book title explanations:** What does "Ash Oaths" mean? Should titles be obvious? User wants context for each title. Suggested approach: evocative title + clear subtitle.
2. **Character intro → cover:** Should a newly introduced character be on the next book's cover? Suggested "Debut → Spotlight" pattern.
3. **Series ending:** Open-ended for more books, or new series with next generation? Suggested: definitive conclusion + sequel series door.
4. **Series epilogue approaches:** User doesn't know what it should look like. Suggested 5 approaches (time skip, passing the torch, one last mystery, the legend, letter to the reader). Recommended combining #1 + #2 + #5.
5. **First person vs third person narration:** Which is more attractive/compelling for YA? Recommended third person limited, close POV.
6. **Series length — 20 vs 12 books:** User open to reducing to 12 (4 per act). Recommended 12 books with sequel series potential.
7. **Amazon optimization:** User needs complete research on keywords, tags, categories, pricing, description format. Provided full KDP publishing template.
8. **Box set ideas:** User wants to know how to create box sets. Provided 3 options (act-based, complete series, starter set).

**Process Instructions:**

- Update `book-ideas.md` with ALL above changes and discussion topics
- Update `user-prompts.md` (this file) with Prompt #5
- Do NOT create content yet — discussion continues
- Push to GitHub after updates
