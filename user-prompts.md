## 🔖 PROMPT #4 — February 9, 2026, ~2:58 PM PST

### Request: Updates to Plan + Answers to Questions + New Requirements

**New Requirements:**
- Add **elderly characters on BOTH sides** — protagonist elders give solid constructive advice for winning; antagonist elders give solid destructive advice for winning. Language of both sides must clearly show/express their intentions
- Create this **user-prompts.md file** as a running tally of all prompts
- **Chapter length changed to 1,500 words** (user will hold to this — must not fall short)

**Answers to Discussion Questions:**
1. **Chapter length:** 1,500 words per chapter (confirmed, strict)
2. **Villain POV:** Yes, include villain perspective chapters
3. **Hero-villain cover pairing:** Yes, but they must look like they're **fighting each other** — not just standing side by side. Use different facial expressions and striking poses for variations. Wizards/warlocks use lightning bolts and creative magic effects, not just swords. Protagonist samurai warriors use swords + other weapons too.
4. **New characters:** Yes, phase them in across later books, not all 20 at once. Every character on a cover must look **completely distinct** — memorable, unforgettable, unique facial features, appearance, and weapons. No two characters should look similar.
5. **Romance:** Yes, include romance subplots. **Rename characters** to have names that are easy to pronounce and remember. Aztec-samurai fusion names that sound awesome and cool (not simple like John/Mary). Villain names should sound powerful and menacing (like "Dalenthar," "Voltar"). There is power in a name — the reader should perceive the character's image from the name alone. Names must be uniquely memorable.
6. **Character deaths:** User is unsure how to handle this. Doesn't want loveable characters to die quickly (would prevent readers from buying further books). Needs guidance — should they die at the end or during the series? Wants a strategy discussion.
7. **Cover prompts clarification:** User wants elaboration on the difference between "character reference prompts" and "story-specific prompts" so they have a clear understanding.

**Process Instructions:**
- Update `book-ideas.md` with all the above changes
- Create `user-prompts.md` (this file) for running tally
- Update the prompts file before every GitHub push
- Do NOT create content yet — update planning docs only, then discuss
