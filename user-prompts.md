# 📋 AZTEC SAMURAI ADVENTURES — DISCUSSION LOG

_A running tally of every request/prompt given by the user, followed by AI suggestions, questions, and recommendations. This file reads as a complete discussion history._
_Updated before every GitHub push._

## 🔖 PROMPT #1 — February 9, 2026, ~1:51 PM PST

### 👤 USER REQUEST: Create Book Cover Image Prompt for Lead Warrior (Xochitl)

**Details:**

- User provided a book cover prompt from another series (Reality Without Belief) as a template
- Asked to replace all content with Aztec Samurai Adventures series content
- Source material: the Series Bible PDF in the project folder
- Lead warrior (Xochitl) must be on the cover in a **fierce action pose**
- She must look **beautiful, drop dead gorgeous, young and vibrant** — those characteristics must come across in her attacking pose
- Use appropriate colours and fonts theme (turquoise + obsidian + gold, Trajan Pro font)
- Output the prompt in the **same structure and format** as the original, but with different content
- Be as **creative as possible**

**Result:** Created a full cover prompt for Book 1 — Sunblade Rising, featuring Xochitl mid-strike with jade-obsidian katana, demon gate shattering in background. User was extremely pleased.

### 🤖 AI SUGGESTIONS & QUESTIONS AFTER PROMPT #1:

1. **Suggested creating prompts for ALL characters**, not just Xochitl — since the series has 20 characters, each could have their own reference prompt.
2. **Noted the turquoise + obsidian + gold palette** as the series visual identity — recommended keeping this consistent across all covers.
3. **Identified the need for two types of prompts:** character reference prompts (standalone portraits) and story-specific cover prompts (tied to a specific book's plot). This distinction became important later.

---

## 🔖 PROMPT #2 — February 9, 2026, ~2:03 PM PST

### 👤 USER REQUEST: Create Image Prompts for ALL 20 Characters

**Details:**

- Look at all 20 characters (10 heroes + 10 villains) from the Series Bible PDF
- Create image prompts for each character on a book cover
- Use **different poses, different facial expressions, different characteristics** based on each character
- Create prompts as `.txt` files in a folder called `book-cover-prompts`
- Naming convention: number (01, 02, etc.) + dash + character name + dash + what they are (warrior, wizard, etc.)

**Result:** Created 20 `.txt` files in `book-cover-prompts/`:

- 01–10: Heroes (Xochitl, Coil, Acatl, Jaguar, Nenetl, Sky-Eagle, Miyako, Rain-Dancer, Xipilli, Sun-Forge)
- 11–20: Villains (Albérico, Vesper, Sable, Vezaro, Helios, Vitra, Kharon, Ash Choir, Nacre, Vastrix)
- Each with unique poses, expressions, backgrounds, and character-specific details

### 🤖 AI SUGGESTIONS & QUESTIONS AFTER PROMPT #2:

1. **Recommended organizing characters by role**, not just by hero/villain — this helps when planning which character appears on which book's cover.
2. **Noted that these 20 prompts are "character reference" prompts** — they establish what each character looks like but aren't tied to specific book plots. Later we'll need "story-specific" prompts that depict scenes from each book.
3. **Suggested renaming the folder** from `book-cover-prompts` to `character-reference-prompts` once we create the story-specific prompts in each book's `image-prompts/` folder.
4. **Asked:** Should we expand the series beyond the original 7-book plan? 20 characters across 7 books means some characters won't get a spotlight book.

## 🔖 PROMPT #3 — February 9, 2026, ~2:37 PM PST

### 👤 USER REQUEST: Create GitHub Repo + Expand Series to 20 Books + Plan Discussion

**Details:**

- Create a remote GitHub repo named `aztec-samurai-adventures`
- Expand the series from 7 books to **20 books**
- Each book has **24 chapters**
- Chapter endings must have **proper cliffhangers** leading directly into the next chapter
- Book endings must have **proper cliffhangers** leading directly into the next book
- Language must be comfortable and exciting for **teenagers and young adults**
- Readers should feel **super inspired by protagonists** and **overwhelmed/in awe by antagonists**
- Chapter lengths: **~1,000 words** (short enough for teen attention spans)
- Each book features **main characters** but focuses on the **cover character**
- **Xochitl (hero leader) and Albérico (villain leader) have heavy focus in ALL books** — constant throughout series
- Look at the reference project at `E:\reality-without-belief` (book-series folder) and **replicate that folder structure** for this project
- Create a `book-ideas.md` document in root folder with planning thoughts
- Use **big fonts, colours, and emojis** in the markdown
- **Do NOT create content yet** — discussion first, then creation
- Maintain the **4Cs**: Continuity, Clarity, Consistency, Coherency

**Result:**

- GitHub repo created: `ketankshukla/aztec-samurai-adventures`
- Reference project structure studied thoroughly
- `book-ideas.md` created with: 3-act structure across 20 books, folder structure, cliffhanger strategy, tone guide, master checklist, 8 improvement suggestions, 7 discussion questions

### 🤖 AI SUGGESTIONS & QUESTIONS AFTER PROMPT #3:

1. **Proposed the Three-Act Structure:** Act I (Books 1–7: The Rising), Act II (Books 8–14: The Breaking), Act III (Books 15–20: The Reckoning) — each with escalating stakes.
2. **Suggested 8 improvements to the plan:**
   - Create a World Map document
   - Create a Timeline document
   - Create a Power Progression chart
   - Create a Relationship Web document
   - Create "Previously On..." sections for each book
   - Give each villain their own defeat arc (spread across the series)
   - Add villain-POV interlude chapters
   - Create a "Character Cards" system for marketing
3. **Raised 7 discussion questions:**
   - Should chapters be longer than 1,000 words? (YA typically runs 1,500–3,000)
   - Should we include villain POV chapters?
   - Should covers feature hero-villain pairs?
   - Should we introduce all characters at once or phase them in?
   - Should there be romance subplots?
   - How do we handle character deaths across 20 books?
   - Do we need both "character reference" and "story-specific" cover prompts?

## 🔖 PROMPT #4 — February 9, 2026, ~2:58 PM PST

### 👤 USER REQUEST: Updates to Plan + Answers to Questions + New Requirements

**New Requirements:**

- Add **elderly characters on BOTH sides** — protagonist elders give solid constructive advice for winning; antagonist elders give solid destructive advice for winning. Language of both sides must clearly show/express their intentions
- Create this **user-prompts.md file** as a running tally of all prompts
- **Chapter length changed to 1,500 words** (user will hold to this — must not fall short)

**Answers to Discussion Questions:**

1. **Chapter length:** 1,500 words per chapter (confirmed, strict)
2. **Villain POV:** Yes, include villain perspective chapters
3. **Hero-villain cover pairing:** Yes, but they must look like they're **fighting each other** — not just standing side by side. Use different facial expressions and striking poses for variations. Wizards/warlocks use lightning bolts and creative magic effects, not just swords. Protagonist samurai warriors use swords + other weapons too.
4. **New characters:** Yes, phase them in across later books, not all 20 at once. Every character on a cover must look **completely distinct** — memorable, unforgettable, unique facial features, appearance, and weapons. No two characters should look similar.
5. **Romance:** Yes, include romance subplots. **Rename characters** to have names that are easy to pronounce and remember. Aztec-samurai fusion names that sound awesome and cool (not simple like John/Mary). Villain names should sound powerful and menacing (like "Dalenthar," "Voltar"). There is power in a name — the reader should perceive the character's image from the name alone. Names must be uniquely memorable.
6. **Character deaths:** User is unsure how to handle this. Doesn't want loveable characters to die quickly (would prevent readers from buying further books). Needs guidance — should they die at the end or during the series? Wants a strategy discussion.
7. **Cover prompts clarification:** User wants elaboration on the difference between "character reference prompts" and "story-specific prompts" so they have a clear understanding.

### 🤖 AI SUGGESTIONS & QUESTIONS AFTER PROMPT #4:

1. **Character Death Strategy — "The Slow Burn":** Proposed a graduated loss approach:
   - Act I (Books 1–7): NO major hero deaths. Build reader investment. Minor allies can die.
   - Act II (Books 8–14): ONE hero death max TWO — deep enough that readers are devastated. Best candidates: characters whose arc is about sacrifice (healer, sensei, armorer).
   - Act III (Books 15–20): ONE to TWO more. Total across series: 2–4 maximum.
   - Characters who should NEVER die: Itzil (protagonist), the romantic interest, the comic relief.
2. **Cover Prompt Types Explained:** Two distinct types:
   - **Type 1: Character Reference Prompts** — standalone portraits for visual reference and marketing. Already created 20 of these.
   - **Type 2: Story-Specific Cover Prompts** — tied to a specific book's plot. 5 variants per book. These become the actual published covers.
3. **Elderly Character Design:** Proposed at least 4 elders (2 hero, 2 villain) with distinct language styles:
   - Hero elders: warm but firm, proverbs that hit like hammers, wisdom of experience
   - Villain elders: cold, elegant, terrifyingly logical, wisdom of conquest
4. **Naming Convention Proposal:** Names should evoke the character's image. Villain names with hard consonants (-ar, -thar, -zar). Hero names with flowing sounds (-il, -en, -ra).
5. **Romance Arc:** Suggested planning which characters pair up, when it develops, and how it affects the war storyline.

**Process Instructions:**

- Update `book-ideas.md` with all the above changes
- Create `user-prompts.md` (this file) for running tally
- Update the prompts file before every GitHub push
- Do NOT create content yet — update planning docs only, then discuss

---

## 🔖 PROMPT #5 — February 9, 2026, ~3:53 PM PST

### 👤 USER REQUEST: Major Plan Updates + Many Discussion Topics

**New Requirements:**

- **CLARITY section update:** Add "Where We're Headed" alongside "Where We Have Been" — readers should always know both directions
- **Start the saga from SCRATCH** — don't expand the original 7-book outline. Design everything fresh since no chapters have been written yet.
- **Rename main character** from Xochitl to **Itzil** (CONFIRMED)
- **No accented characters in names.** Names must be phonetically smooth and flowing. Villain names should sound like pirate/Scandinavian (endings in -ar, -thar, -zar). "Alberico sounds like a guy who sells tacos." Use names like Dalenthar, Volzentar. Hero names must sound cool and memorable but not simple (no John/Mary).
- **Every book must tell the reader** where they've been AND where they're headed — in the book itself AND in the Amazon book description.
- **Cover image backgrounds must be SHARP and REALISTIC** — no oil painting look, no fuzzy/blurred backgrounds. Super detailed photorealistic backgrounds with clear visible battles. Text structure stays the same (it's fantastic).
- **Reference these prompt folders** when creating cover image prompts:
  - `E:\reality-without-belief\reality-prompts\`
  - `E:\repetition-mother-of-mastery\golden-prompts-v2\`
- **Series conclusion must be inspiring** with lessons learned, empowering content.
- **Series epilogue** must tell reader what to look forward to next (like every book epilogue does). User needs suggestions for epilogue approaches.

**Questions Raised by User (for discussion, no action yet):**

1. **Book title explanations:** What does "Ash Oaths" mean? Should titles be obvious? User wants context for each title.
2. **Character intro → cover:** Should a newly introduced character be on the next book's cover?
3. **Series ending:** Open-ended for more books, or new series with next generation?
4. **Series epilogue approaches:** User doesn't know what it should look like.
5. **First person vs third person narration:** Which is more attractive/compelling for YA?
6. **Series length — 20 vs 12 books:** User open to reducing to 12 (4 per act).
7. **Amazon optimization:** User needs complete research on keywords, tags, categories, pricing, description format.
8. **Box set ideas:** User wants to know how to create box sets.

### 🤖 AI SUGGESTIONS & QUESTIONS AFTER PROMPT #5:

1. **Series Length — Recommended 12 books (4 per act):**

   - Analyzed successful YA series (Harry Potter 7, Percy Jackson 5, Hunger Games 3, Throne of Glass 8)
   - 12 books = 432,000 words, still longer than Lord of the Rings
   - Cleaner 3-act structure (4+4+4), less filler risk, better for teen attention spans
   - Percy Jackson model: finish a series, then launch sequel series in same world
   - Box set of 12 more attractive than box set of 20

2. **Book Titles — Recommended evocative title + clear subtitle:**

   - Main title = intriguing, epic (makes them pick it up)
   - Subtitle = clear, tells them what to expect (makes them buy)
   - Example: "Sunblade Rising: The First Battle for the Sacred Flame"
   - Explained what each current title means and why

3. **Character Intro → Cover — Recommended "Debut → Spotlight" pattern:**

   - Character introduced in Book N as supporting → gets cover/focus in Book N+1
   - Not a rigid rule — story always wins over pattern
   - Itzil can appear on multiple covers as the constant

4. **Series Epilogue — Recommended combining 3 of 5 approaches:**

   - Approach 1: Time Skip (flash forward 5-10 years)
   - Approach 2: Passing the Torch (young person asks for guidance)
   - Approach 3: One Last Mystery (something unexplained, not a threat)
   - Approach 4: The Legend (saga retold to a new generation)
   - Approach 5: Letter to the Reader (direct empowerment)
   - **Recommended: #1 + #2 + #5** (time skip, torch, letter)

5. **Narration — Recommended third person limited, close POV:**

   - First person too limiting for multiple hero POVs and villain chapters
   - Third person limited reads almost as intimately as first person
   - Harry Potter, Throne of Glass, Shadow and Bone all use this successfully

6. **Character Naming — Provided full name tables:**

   - Villain names: Volzentar, Seravix, Mirathane, Gravok, Helisar, Relicara, Kharzek, etc.
   - Hero names: Itzil (confirmed), Kaelen, Torvane, Jagren, Lumara, Skyren, etc.
   - No accents, phonetically smooth, the name paints the character

7. **Amazon KDP — Full publishing template provided:**

   - 7 backend keywords per book, 3 categories, pricing strategy
   - Book description template with "Where We've Been / Where We're Headed"
   - Organic ranking factors explained
   - A+ Content and Author Page recommendations

8. **Box Sets — 3 options recommended (do all three):**

   - Act-based (3 sets of 4 books) — $6.99 each
   - Complete series (all 12) — $14.99–$19.99
   - Starter set (first 3) — $4.99

9. **Cover Image Fix — Explicit requirements documented:**
   - NO oil painting, NO watercolor, NO fuzzy backgrounds
   - Sharp photorealistic detail, visible battles, cinematic realism
   - Text structure stays the same (it works perfectly)

**Questions for user:**

1. What do you prefer — 12 books or 20?
2. Do you like the Title + Subtitle approach?
3. Review the name tables — which names do you like?
4. Does the "Debut → Spotlight" cover pattern work?
5. Which epilogue approach(es) do you prefer?
6. Third person limited (close) or first person?
7. Any other changes before we lock decisions in?

5. **Series epilogue:** ✅ **Combination of #1 (Time Skip) + #2 (Passing the Torch) + #5 (Letter to Reader)** — CONFIRMED
6. **Narration style:** ✅ **Third person limited, close POV** — CONFIRMED

**New Requests:**

1. **Create a finalized series template document** (`book-series-template.md`) — unlike `book-ideas.md` which has all the discussion history, this is a CLEAN, REUSABLE document. It should be structured so the user can use it as a "fill-in-the-blanks" template to create ANY new book series in one shot with AI. Recommend what the user needs to tell the AI to generate a new series using this template.

2. **Amazon A+ Content discussion:** User likes the idea of branding. Questions:
   - Should they brand as themselves (personal name) or as **Metronagon** (their self-publishing company)?
   - Already has books published under their own name
   - Should they create a new Amazon KDP account for Metronagon, or use their existing one?

### 🤖 AI SUGGESTIONS & QUESTIONS AFTER PROMPT #6:

1. **All decisions are now LOCKED.** The series is 12 books, 4 per act, with all character names finalized, third person limited close POV, title + subtitle format, Debut → Spotlight cover pattern, and the epilogue combines Time Skip + Passing the Torch + Letter to Reader.

2. **Kaelen as love interest:** This is a strong choice. Kaelen (the scout) and Itzil (the commander) have natural chemistry potential — the careful strategist falling for the daring rogue who operates alone. Their romance arc could build slowly: mutual respect in Act I, growing trust and tension in Act II, and full partnership (romantic + tactical) in Act III. This also means **Kaelen should NOT die** (per our earlier rule that the romantic interest survives).

3. **Created `book-series-template.md`** — a clean, reusable template with fill-in-the-blanks placeholders. This can be used to spin up any new series by providing the AI with:

   - Genre, target audience, and tone
   - Number of books and chapters per book
   - Main characters (heroes + villains) with brief descriptions
   - The central conflict/war
   - Magic system or power rules
   - World setting and geography
   - The AI fills in: 3-act structure, chapter outlines, cliffhanger map, character arcs, death schedule, cover prompt guidelines, Amazon publishing template, and folder structure.

4. **Amazon A+ / Branding — FULL ANALYSIS PROVIDED:**

   **DO NOT create a new KDP account.** Amazon's Terms of Service allow only ONE KDP account per person. Creating a second risks having BOTH accounts banned. Instead:

   - Use your existing KDP account
   - Publish the Aztec Samurai Adventures under **Metronagon** as the **publisher/imprint name** (KDP allows this per-book)
   - Your personal name (or a pen name) stays as the **author name**
   - This gives you: `Published by Metronagon | Author: [Your Name or Pen Name]`
   - Your existing books under your own name stay as they are
   - The Metronagon branding appears in A+ Content, on the book's detail page, and in the copyright page

   **Metronagon vs Personal Name — Recommendation:**

   - **Use Metronagon as the publisher/imprint** — it's professional, brandable, and memorable
   - **Use your real name OR a pen name as the author** — readers connect with authors, not publishers
   - If your existing books are non-fiction or a different genre, a **pen name** for this YA fantasy series helps avoid confusing existing readers
   - If you want everything under one identity, use your real name for both

   **A+ Content strategy:**

   - Create a Metronagon brand story module (who you are, your mission)
   - Character showcase modules (images of heroes and villains)
   - Series reading order module
   - Comparison chart module ("If you liked X, you'll love Y")
   - These make your Amazon listing look PREMIUM — most indie authors skip this, so it's a competitive advantage

**Questions for user:**

1. Do you want to use a pen name for this YA series, or publish under your real name with Metronagon as the imprint?
2. Are your existing published books in a completely different genre? (This affects whether a pen name is advisable)
3. Should the template document include the Amazon A+ Content strategy as part of the reusable template, or keep that separate?

## 🔖 PROMPT #7 — February 9, 2026, ~5:01 PM PST

### 👤 USER REQUEST: Amazon Branding Decision — Metronagon + Real Name

**Details:**

- User has 6 non-fiction books already published but not yet marketed
- Wants to use **Metronagon** as the publisher (website already registered)
- Also wants to be recognized as a fiction writer — readers should see his name on the book
- Asked: "Can I go with Metronagon as well as my own name?"

### 🤖 AI RESPONSE:

**Answer: Yes — this is exactly how it works.**

Amazon KDP has two separate fields:

- **Author Name** = **Ketan Shukla** (appears on cover, Amazon listing, search results)
- **Publisher/Imprint** = **Metronagon** (appears on copyright page, Amazon detail page, A+ Content)

This is the standard indie publishing setup. Think of Metronagon as the publishing company and yourself as its star author. Benefits:

- **Personal recognition** — your name is front and center, building your brand as a fiction writer
- **Professional credibility** — Metronagon makes you look like a real publishing house
- **Unified brand** — non-fiction + fiction all under the Metronagon umbrella
- **Metronagon.com** becomes the publishing hub for ALL your titles

**Existing catalog strategy:**

- Keep all 6 non-fiction books under Ketan Shukla as author
- Optionally update their publisher field to Metronagon to unify the brand
- When the fiction series takes off, it lifts the author name which lifts ALL books

**Decision: CONFIRMED.** Updated `book-ideas.md` — A+ Branding section now marked ✅ CONFIRMED with Metronagon as publisher and Ketan Shukla as author.

## 🔖 PROMPT #8 — February 9, 2026, ~5:04 PM PST

### 👤 USER REQUEST: Do I Need to Update My Non-Fiction Books to Show Metronagon?

**Details:**

- User wants to know if they have to go back and update existing 6 non-fiction books on KDP to change the publisher to Metronagon
- They want those non-fiction books on the Metronagon website too

### 🤖 AI RESPONSE:

**Answer: It's optional but recommended.**

The non-fiction books will continue to sell as-is. But since the user wants them on the Metronagon website, updating the publisher field on KDP creates a unified brand.

**How to do it:**

- KDP Bookshelf → click each book → edit "Book Details" → change Publisher field to "Metronagon" → save and publish
- ~5 minutes per book, no content changes needed, no re-upload, no new ISBN
- Books stay live — Amazon just updates the publisher field within 24-72 hours

**On Metronagon.com:** List all titles (6 non-fiction + Aztec Samurai series) organized by category. Visitors see a real publishing catalog, not a one-book operation.

**Bottom line:** 30 minutes of KDP updates + a proper website = a unified brand that looks like a legit publishing house.
