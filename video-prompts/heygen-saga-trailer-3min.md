# AZTEC SAMURAI ADVENTURES — OFFICIAL SAGA TRAILER
## HeyGen Video Agent Script | 3:00 Landscape (16:9)

---

### PRODUCTION NOTES

- **Format:** 16:9 Landscape, 3:00 minutes (180 seconds)
- **Style:** Cinematic epic fantasy trailer — dramatic, emotional, building to crescendo
- **Music:** Cinematic dramatic orchestral score — begins haunting and intimate, builds through tension and war, crescendos into triumphant sunrise. Think Hans Zimmer meets Ramin Djawadi. Drums, strings, horns, choir.
- **Voice:** Deep, resonant male narrator — gravitas of a mythic storyteller. Measured pace. Let silence breathe between lines.
- **Animation:** All 30 character portraits should be animated with subtle motion — breathing, hair movement, eye shifts, atmospheric particle effects. Ken Burns slow zoom/pan on each portrait. Dramatic lighting shifts between hero (warm gold) and villain (cold crimson/violet) segments.
- **Character Images:** All sourced from `public/images/character-portraits/` — referenced by filename below.

## ACT I — THE RISING (0:00 – 0:55)

---

### SCENE 1 — COLD OPEN (0:00 – 0:12)

**[BLACK SCREEN — 2 seconds of silence, then a single low drum heartbeat]**

**[FADE IN: 01-Itzil.jpg — slow zoom into her golden eyes, warm amber light blooming around the frame. Embers drift upward. Her Sun-Blade ignites with golden fire along its edge.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
> *"Before the war. Before the blade. Before the world learned her name... there was a girl who didn't want to be chosen."*

**[Musical score enters — a single cello, low and haunting, joined by a distant choir hum]**

---

### SCENE 2 — THE MENTOR (0:12 – 0:22)

**[CROSSFADE TO: 04-Korvain.jpg — slow pan across the weathered grandmaster. Golden dust particles. Warm candlelight. His jade katana gleams.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
> *"Korvain — the Last Grandmaster of the Sun-Blade Order — saw what others couldn't. Not a frightened student... but a legend waiting to wake."*

**[His eyes flicker with knowing warmth. Score adds a gentle flute — ancient, Eastern, reverent.]**

**[QUICK CUT TO: 09-Miyako.jpg — shadows rippling around her. Cool blue-grey tones.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
> *"And Miyako — the Exile Sensei — emerged from thirty years of hiding to teach one final student the art of walking in shadows."*

---

### SCENE 3 — ASSEMBLING THE ALLIANCE (0:22 – 0:42)

**[Score shifts — drums enter with a slow, building war-march rhythm. Strings add tension.]**

**[RAPID MONTAGE — 2.5 seconds each, Ken Burns push-in on each portrait. Gold-tinted lighting for heroes:]**

**[02-Kaelen.jpg — scout crouched in shadow, eyes scanning. Violet ambient light.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
> *"Kaelen — the Shadow Scout. Last survivor of the 7th Reconnaissance Unit."*

**[08-Jagren.jpg — fists clenched, arena scars glowing in firelight. Red-orange tones.]**

> *"Jagren — the Duelist. An arena fighter who craved glory... and found horror instead."*

**[07-Neyla.jpg — turquoise healing light radiating from her hands. Soft, ethereal glow.]**

> *"Neyla — the Healer. Whose compassion would become the deadliest weapon in the war."*

**[15-Torvane.jpg — oil-stained hands gripping blueprints. Workshop sparks in the background.]**

> *"Torvane — the Engineer. The quiet man who built impossible things."*

**[11-Amalura.jpg — fierce eyes behind reading glasses, ancient texts surrounding her.]**

> *"Amalura — the Keeper of Lore. Whose sharp tongue cuts deeper than any blade."*

**[13-Zariel.jpg — diplomatic finery, disarming smile hiding a calculating gaze.]**

> *"Zariel — the Diplomat. Every conversation... a chess match."*

**[Score reaches a brief martial peak — a single horn call.]**

---

### SCENE 4 — THE DOMINION RISES (0:42 – 0:55)

**[HARD CUT TO BLACK — 1 second of dead silence. Then a deep, reverberating BOOM.]**

**[SMASH CUT TO: 03-Volzentar.jpg — slow zoom into his amber-gold eyes with crimson flecks. The iron crown pulses with dark red light. Smoke and embers swirl.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
> *"But across the continent... an emperor watched. Volzentar — who conquered nations not with armies... but with a single, terrifying idea."*

**[His voice echoes, distorted, layered:]**
> *"Order is not cruelty. It is mercy... with a longer view."*

**[FLASH TO: 05-Nightshade.jpg — violet-black eyes with floating crimson embers. Blood-magic sigils pulse along her coat. Unsettling beauty.]**

> *"His spymaster, Nightshade — who weaponized beauty into an art form... and commanded the blood in your veins."*

**[FLASH TO: 06-Valdremor.jpg — crystal eye glowing violet. Cold, gaunt, precise.]**

> *"And Valdremor — The Architect — who was always... three steps ahead."*

**[Score drops to a menacing low brass drone. Tension building.]**

---

---

### SCENE 5 — WAR ERUPTS (0:55 – 1:10)

**[EXPLOSION OF SOUND — full orchestra hits. War drums thundering. Strings racing.]**

**[RAPID-FIRE MONTAGE — 1.5 seconds each, shaking camera, battle lighting:]**

**[18-Gravok.jpg — towering beast commander, war-beasts roaring behind him.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
> *"Gravok unleashed his beast armies through mirror-portals — three cities burning at once."*

**[20-Dalrignon.jpg — wild-eyed, manic, crystal fragments orbiting his hands.]**

> *"Dalrignon built portals powered by crystallized human souls."*

**[17-Helisar.jpg — warm, fatherly smile. Gentle eyes. The most terrifying image in the series because he looks kind.]**

> *"And Helisar... the Fallen Saint... ran a sanctuary that was really a factory. He enslaved thousands. And he remembered... every single name."*

**[22-Relicara.jpg — stolen artifacts pulsing around her. Cathedral of power.]**

> *"Relicara hoarded stolen relics in a fortress-cathedral of unimaginable power."*

**[19-Pearlvaine.jpg — iridescent skin, shifting eyes, pearl-adorned diplomatic robes.]**

> *"And Pearlvaine — the Demon Diplomat — who never lied. She simply told you the truth... you wanted to hear."*

---

**[Score shifts — heroic theme breaking through the chaos. Hope amid war.]**

**[14-Rainara.jpg — turquoise water-knot markings blazing. Water swirling around her like a living shield.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**

---

### SCENE 7 — EVERYTHING SHATTERS (1:25 – 1:50)

**[Score drops to near-silence. A single piano note. Then another. Heartbeat rhythm.]**

**[SLOW ZOOM: 09-Miyako.jpg — her face softened, at peace. Fading golden light.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.) — voice drops, intimate, grieving:**
> *"Miyako fought her last battle protecting the people she'd once abandoned. Her final words to Kaelen..."*

**[Whispered, echoing:]**
> *"You don't need to be perfect. You just need to be there."*

**[2-second pause. Score: single sustained violin note, trembling.]**

**[SLOW ZOOM: 04-Korvain.jpg — eyes closing, peaceful, golden light fading from his blade.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
> *"And Korvain — the last grandmaster — smiled as the Sun-Blade shattered in Itzil's hands."*

**[His voice, distant, warm:]**
> *"The blade broke. Good. Now you know... you don't need it. You never did."*

**[HARD CUT TO: 01-Itzil.jpg — but different framing now: zoomed tight on her face, golden light extinguished, rain falling, eyes red. The only time she cries.]**

**[Score: silence. Then a single, devastating cello note.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
> *"Her blade was shattered. Her mentors were gone. And the sky above the Dominion capital... cracked open with red light."*

---

## ACT III — THE RECKONING (1:50 – 2:45)

---

### SCENE 8 — THE REFORGING (1:50 – 2:05)

**[Score rebuilds — slowly, powerfully. A forge-hammer rhythm. Growing. Each beat stronger.]**

**[10-Solkren.jpg — forge blazing, fragments of the Sun-Blade glowing on his anvil.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
> *"But the blade was always meant to break. It was designed... to be reforged. Not from metal. From memory. From sacrifice. From the souls of everyone who chose to fight."*

**[MONTAGE — rapid flashes, 1 second each, each hero's portrait with a golden thread of light streaming from their chest toward the forge:]**

**01-Itzil** → **02-Kaelen** → **08-Jagren** → **07-Neyla** → **14-Rainara** → **16-Skyren** → **13-Zariel** → **15-Torvane** → **10-Solkren**

**[Score ERUPTS — full choir, brass fanfare, the heroic theme reborn.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
> *"Nine souls. Nine sacrifices. One blade — burning with the light of everyone who forged it."*

---

### SCENE 9 — THE FINAL WAR (2:05 – 2:25)

**[Full orchestral war march. Drums, brass, strings, choir — EVERYTHING.]**

**[25-Savren.jpg — lightning crackling from his hands. Cold fury.]**
**[26-Gravos.jpg — wild, uncontrolled, grief-shattered. A single word echoing: "BROTHER!"]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
> *"The Ashvanar twins fell. One to grief. One to the quiet engineer who outbuilt a sorcerer."*

**[21-Mirathane.jpg — crystalline features, fractured mirror-eyes. Shattered glass cascading.]**

> *"The Mirror Queen — herself a prisoner for centuries — was freed by the healer who saw her chains."*

**[05-Nightshade.jpg — standing on a battlement edge, blood-magic stripped, just a person.]**

> *"Nightshade was offered mercy. She refused. She fell... on her own terms."*

**[06-Valdremor.jpg — captured, chained, staring at the sky. For the first time... surprised.]**

> *"And Valdremor — the genius who calculated everything — never calculated... conviction."*

**[24-Essara.jpg — quiet, composed, unbroken despite captivity.]**
**[27-Corwen.jpg — tears streaming, a farmer remembering his own name.]**

> *"The war was fought by heroes. But it was fought FOR people like Corwen — a farmer who whispered... 'My name is Corwen. I remember now.'"*

**[29-Brennan.jpg — heavy Thalendor plate, steel-grey eyes. Stern but present.]**
**[30-Sethara.jpg — copper hair blazing like fire, cavalry saber drawn, charging.]**

> *"Nations that once stood apart... rode together. Thalendor's mountain warriors. Pyrrath's desert cavalry. The world... chose to fight."*

---

### SCENE 10 — THE GATE AND THE HUNGER (2:25 – 2:45)

**[Score drops to near-silence. A cosmic drone. Deep, alien, terrifying.]**

**[23-Vastrix.jpg — SLOW REVEAL. Absolute darkness cut from reality. Dead stars orbiting. The void where a face should be. Crushing, incomprehensible scale.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.) — voice drops to barely above a whisper:**
> *"And then... the Gate opened. And through it came something that was not a villain. Not a monster. A dimension... made of hunger."*

**[VASTRIX's voice — layered, cosmic, echoing from every direction:]**
> *"I SEE YOU. ALL OF YOU. AND I AM HUNGRY."*

**[12-Serenthar.jpg — luminous tears, shifting eyes, the faintest... smile. The first smile she has ever given.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
> *"But the Weeping Oracle — who had seen every future — finally chose one. She walked through the Gate... and sealed it from the other side."*

**[01-Itzil.jpg — BLAZING. Full golden light. The reforged Sun-Blade erupting with threads of every hero's color — violet, turquoise, red, blue, amber, green, orange, cyan, gold. She is radiant. She is terrifying. She is everything.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.) — building to full power:**
> *"And Itzil drove the Sun-Blade — forged from every soul who chose to fight — into the heart of the void. And the blade didn't just wound it. It SANG. A sound... like every sunrise... that ever was."*

**[BLINDING WHITE FLASH — 1.5 seconds]**

## FINALE (2:45 – 3:00)

---

### SCENE 11 — DAWN (2:45 – 2:55)

**[Silence. Then... birdsong. A warm golden light slowly filling the screen.]**

**[WIDE SHOT: All 30 character portraits arranged in an epic panoramic composition — heroes in warm golden light on the left, villains fading into shadow on the right, Itzil at the center holding the blazing Sun-Blade. Serenthar and Vastrix as ghostly silhouettes above the Gate. Korvain and Miyako as golden spectral presences watching over the heroes.]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.) — warm, quiet, the voice of a grandfather finishing a story:**
> *"Twelve books. Thirty souls. One saga."*

**[Beat.]**

> *"The sun never sets... on those who refuse to kneel."*
